The UK grooming gang scandal is a Galileo moment,"This article contains graphicdescriptions of a sort that we would not normally publish but which, in this case, are in the public interest to do so. THERE IS a simple reason that the UK’s grooming gangs scandal is so difficult for liberally minded people to wrap their minds around, and that reason is that the scandal is exactly what ‘the far right’ says it is: Mass, religiously and racially aggravated, rape of thousands of young white working class British girls by Muslim men from mostly Pakistani immigrant backgrounds, on an industrial and organised scale. Every racially aggravating factor you could imagine is present. First, there is substantial evidence that the young girls in question were targetedbecausethey were white. In these communities of Pakistani Muslim rapists, hardly any of the victims were Pakistani Muslim women. Second, the scale of the depravity and violence makes it clear that in many – if not a clear majority – of cases, the abuse was more than just about sex. It was about domination, enslavement, and humiliation. If you doubt me on this point, just readthis 2013 sentencing reportthat did the rounds on X (formerly twitter) in recent days. There’s a quote from it later in this article that sums up the kind of thing you’ll find in there. Third, there is overwhelming evidence that in many cases the abuse was covered up by the authorities and then downplayed by the media right across Britain because it was more ideologically convenient to ignore the mass rape of children than it was to confront the fact that a substantial section of the British Pakistani community harboured (and indeed still harbours) violently sexist and racist attitudes towards white non-muslim women in particular. The implications of that idea wereand aresimply too great for the liberal mind to contemplate its admission. If multiculturalism has a foundational myth, that myth is that all cultures are compatible with each other and that they can always peacefully and harmoniously co-exist in an open and democratic society. The British grooming gangs scandal shatters that myth. The United Kingdom, like most western democracies, is now a feminist society. Women have equal rights in law, and cultural and sexual politics have shifted dramatically over the past fifty years in favour of women. Pakistan remains a deeply entrenched patriarchal society where religious attitudes towards women, and particularly towards men’s right to access women sexually, dominate. Throw in multiculturalism and tolerance and ‘community cohesion’ as major values, and then mix in hard-line Muslim attitudes towards ‘kuffar’ women and women who show more of their flesh than a burkha permits, and the UK gets the mass rape of young white girls by Pakistani Muslim men who believe themselves to have both a cultural and a religious right to use those girls as they see fit. When liberally minded people critique the Catholic church, they often cite the imprisonment in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII of Galileo Galilei, as a result of the latter’s insistence that the earth is round and revolves around the Sun. When that story is recounted, it is presented as a morality tale about how the Roman Catholic Church is anti-science and anti-progress. But it is a human story at heart: Galileo presented evidence that shattered more than a millennium of religious certainty. Faced with evidence, Urban could either publicly accept that a thousand years of teaching had been wrong – risking people askingwhat elsewas wrong – or he could preserve the authority of the Church and silence the heretic. He chose to silence the heretic. The problem, if that analogy wasn’t clear enough for you, is that the UK’s grooming scandal shatters decades of liberal teaching about multiculturalism and might be expected to force people to admit that they might have been wrong. Given the choice between having that discussion on the one hand and writing off all those who raise it as heretics who need silencing on the other, modern British liberals have chosen the path of Urban. Thus, Tommy Robinson is a household name in Britain (and indeed Ireland) for his alleged ‘islamophobia’ while most of us have never heard the name of the man who branded his initials onto a 13-year-old girl, using red hot metal, on the sensitive skin next to her anal passage. His name is Mohammed Karrar. Here is some more of what he did to that child, in the words of the judge who sentenced him: ‘You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand her anal passage. You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of GH, you also used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion.’ Of course, the grooming scandal (which should really be called what it is – a mass rape scandal) is not the only evidence that the UK has an enormous multiculturalism problem linked primarily to the Islamic religion. A2017 investigationby the Guardian revealed that the UK has between 30 and 90 ‘sharia councils’ in operation, which perform the essential functions of courts, granting divorces, regulating marital disputes, and operating as a parallel legal system. The Guardian is a liberal newspaper, but even it had to report that: ‘In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils “supported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages”.’ This is not, to be clear, a British problem. It is a Pakistani cultural and Muslim religious problem that is taking place in the United Kingdom. What’s more, the whole scandal underlines a fact that sends shivers down liberal spines: that elements of Pakistani culture and the Islamic faith pose a real and existential threat to women living in liberal democratic societies. If the state wishes to prevent threats to women (as the liberal state insists it does) and Pakistani culture and elements of the Islamic faith are threats to women, suddenly the conversations become – of necessity – very uncomfortable. Which is why liberal Britain is so desperate to avoid having them. For this cowardice liberalism in Britain and the wider west deserves nothing but contempt, scorn, and condemnation. A generation of ‘progressive’ political leaders of both parties in Britain from the 1970s onwards have consistently prioritised ‘community relations’ over the safety of their own little girls. Young women were allowed to be treated like human filth, while the entire apparatus of the state looked the other way lest it be accused of racism. All the while, towns like Rotherham and Oldham have been permitted to be turned into bastardised versions of Multan, Pakistan. I will leave you with this story, from 2017. It took place in the aforementioned Multan. A young girl was raped by a boy from her village. The victim had a brother. The perpetrator had a sister. The victim’s brother was summoned before the village council and told that justice had been arranged: To avenge the rape of his sister, he would be presented with the rapist’s younger sister – a 16 year old girl – andtold to rape her in turn. This is the culture that Britain has imported. It is the culture that dominates vast swathes of Northern England. The state, and progressives, having admitted it to their country, have a duty to quash it entirely. Racism and community sensitivity be damned.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-uk-grooming-gang-scandal-is-a-galileo-moment/
The progressives' contempt for the white working class,"THERE is a time to be angry. There is a time when it is a sin not to be angry. This is such a time. I have served in the armed forces. I have been a prison chaplain. I have been a minister in one of the roughest parts of Glasgow. I am not naive. Yet I was unable to finish readingthe details of the atrocitiescommitted by a mainly Pakistani Muslim rape gang on white girls. some of them pre-teen. These vile acts were committedprior to 2013yet have came to light last week. Why were they hidden? I think we know the answer. The great Dutch theologian, church leader and prime minister Abraham Kuyper never lost sight of thekleine mensen, the little people. He knew that the supposedly insignificant working-class people were ignored by the main parties and needed protecting. Our secular progressive elites have no interest in or concern for the ordinary working-class people of Britain. When a nation abandons the Bible, the most vulnerable pay the heaviest price. These were not grooming gangs: dogs are groomed. These were paedophile rape and torture gangs. Neither was this confined to Rochdale; paedophile rape gangs have been operatingin towns and cities throughout the UK.Poor white girlsfrom broken homeswere viewed as legitimate targets for rape and exploitation by men from a faith known for its disdain of women. This happened with the complicity of those charged with protecting children. Ina case from Bradforda 15-year-old girl was placed as a foster child in the family of her rapist and made to marry her abuser in an Islamic ceremony with her social worker present. During this period she was forced to convert to Islam and treated as a domestic slave. Mainly Pakistani Muslims preyed upon poor, vulnerable white girls. They were pimped out to others across Britain. Police and social services were so scared of being called racist or Islamophobic they did nothing to protect the girls or arrest the perpetrators. Sometimes they were orderedto do nothing.One girl claimsto have been raped by 150 men; this began when she was 13. Some girlswere murdered. The depth of the contempt the white progressive managerial class has for the white working class is all too evident; their oikophobia is rampant. The primary responsibility for these horrific acts belongs to the mostly Pakistani Muslim perpetrators. Yet it was the weakness and systemic failures of those with responsibility for protecting their own girls which should make us angriest. For them progressive ideology, especially immigration and multiculturalism, was so important that it was worthwhile sacrificing tens of thousands of working-class white girls. Ultimate responsibility lies with our politicians. These politicians are keen on punishing hate crimes. If there was ever a hate crime it was when groups of mainly Pakistani Muslims targeted vulnerable white girls on racial and religious grounds for industrial-scale rape and torture. These hate crimes were ignored. These horrific crimes would not have been allowed to continue unabated if our politicians had not prioritised multiculturalism and vote gathering, a combination of progressive ideology and moral corruption. The white girls were simply the wrong victims, their suffering got in the way of the progressive narrative. If it had been Asian girls the story might have been different. This scandal touchedthe whole of Britain, yet the currentLabour government refusesto hold a national inquiry, asLaura Perrins wrote inTCWyesterday.It is to be left to local authorities with limited resources to investigate these crimes. One doesn’t need to be cynical to askwho is being protectedand which voting bloc appeased. It does the Conservative Party little good to try to assume the high moral ground and call for a national inquiry. They have just emerged from 14 years in power when they did nothing. The police would not have ignored these crimes without strong political backing and instruction. A law enforcement officer came to the conclusion that a 12-year-old who told police she hadsex with five adultshad done so in a ‘100 per cent consensual [way] in every incident’. Thankfully, he was overruled. Therewas the time when a 13-year-oldwas found half-naked and drunk in a house with a group of seven adult Pakistani men. It was the girl who was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The men were not even questioned, never mind arrested. By way of contrast, fathers who attempted to rescue their underage daughters from the houses in which they were being held and rapedwere arrested. From the copper on the beat to the highest-ranking officer, not one police officer has been disciplined or lost their job and pension. The same police who turned a blind eye to these crimes are still policing us. There has been a mass dereliction of duty amongst the media who pride themselves on ‘speaking truth to power’. With a few brave exceptions, such asAndrew Norfolkof theTimesandCharlie Petersof GB News, they have chosen to ignore the elephant in the room. Our progressive elite are so out of touch with the people of Britain they can only see through woke spectacles.Dr Ella Cockbainof University College Londonwrote in 2013that she was concerned that the existence of child abusing networks run by South Asian men was ‘fuelling racist rhetoric’. She was so blind to reality thatshe opined: ‘It can seem that the greatest effrontery about grooming is not the abuse of children but the interracial sex itself.’ The progressives simply cannot grasp how deeply they hold their fellow countrymen and women in contempt. They cannot possibly admit that they look down on the white working class. After all, being liberal-progressives they are the good guys. They are the enlightened. They are the moral arbiters. They are the ones who understand the whole picture. There is a certain parable about specks of sawdust and planks of wood which springs to mind (Matthew 7:3-5). Professor Alexis Jay, who conducted an inquiry into the mass rapes in Rochdale, wrote: ‘The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.’ To date no police officer has been disciplined, no social work director sacked, no politician held to account. While unwilling to protect the most vulnerable in society, the progressive managerial class are more than willing to protect their own. This societal calamity was papered over. That is no longer the case. The mass rape of white British girls is the most egregious example of the high-handed disdain the progressive powers that be have for the indigenous working class.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-08T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/progressive-contempt-for-the-white-working-class/
How dare Starmer reject a public inquiry into Muslim grooming gangs?,"SIR KEIR Starmer claims that politicians who are calling for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs are‘jumping on a bandwagon of the far right’. In a press conference this morning (about the NHS, obviously, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, obviously) the Prime Minister not only rejected calls for a full public inquiry into the grooming scandal, or more accurately the Muslim child rape, trafficking and prostitution scandal, he also insulted politicians who believe such an inquiry is needed. It was a disgusting slur against anyone who has problems with thesystematic brutalisation of 11-year-old girls. To quote Sir Keir in full: ‘It is something about the nature of our politics because once we lose the anchor that truth matters in the robust debate we must have, then we are on a very slippery slope and when politicians, and I mean politicians, who sat in government for many years are casual about honesty, decency, truth and the rule of law, calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far right, then that affects politics because a robust debate can only be based on the true facts and that is why this is actually an important point about our politics, not about what anybody may or may not say on Twitter.’ A few things. First, it is noteworthy that this press conference was not about the child gang rape scandal but about the NHS, which in itself tells you all you need to know. As I have said before, there are very few subjects that get the lectern treatment: Far Right Thugs get the lectern treatment, the NHS gets the lectern treatment. How and why young white girls were raped and brutalised by gangs of Muslim men while authorities stood by is not worthy of the lectern treatment.This tells you all you need to know about Labour’s political priorities. Second, how dare he? How very dare he say that calling for a proper statutory inquiry into the biggest scandal in British history, namely Muslim gangs of men raping, trafficking and prostituting thousands of white working-class girls, some as young as 11, around the country, while police forces looked the other way, is ‘jumping on the band wagon of the far right’. Yes, there have been inquiries before. There was theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by Professor Alexis Jay, but that was a much broader inquiry into sexual abuse by the Catholic church, Anglican church and others. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry in 2014 after it was revealed that at least 1,400 girls in the South Yorkshire town were abused between 1997 and 2013. TheTimesreported: ‘An eight-year investigation into multiple police failings during the Rotherham sex grooming scandal was condemned as a disgrace after its final report revealed that no officers have been dismissed . . . The IOPC’s resulting Operation Linden investigation examined 265 allegations against 47 police officers by 51 complainants, most of them abuse survivors. It upheld 43 of the complaints and ruled that 14 officers “had a case to answer” for misconduct or gross misconduct.’ One unnamed officer was said to have told the mother of an exploited childthat it was a ‘fashion accessory’ for Rotherham girls to have an ‘older Asian boyfriend’ and that she would ‘grow out of it’. And there were other local council inquiries and safeguarding reviews. But as Sir Keir Starmer well knows – he is a human rights lawyer who normally cannot get enough of inquiries – this is very different from an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 where people are called to give evidence under oath. Starmer says that ‘robust debate can only be based on the true facts’. Ok then, genius, order an inquiry into the rape gangs, and any possible misconduct by police officers under the Inquiries Act 2005 and we will get to the facts. As a bonus, all your human rights lawyer buddies will be quids in for years. Why is Starmer dragging his feet over a public inquiry? As a rule, politicians normally can’t wait to order an inquiry. They demand inquiries over anything. We have the current ridiculous UK Covid-19 Inquiry which will tell us at the end of it all that we should have locked down harder and earlier. There is an Undercover Policing Inquiry. There is the Dawn Sturgess Inquiry, ‘an independent Inquiry into the circumstances ofDawn Sturgess’s deathin Salisbury on 8 July 2018’. There is theIndependent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan‘to investigate the “deliberate detention operations” conducted by the British armed forces in Afghanistan between the period of mid-2010 to mid-2013 to determine whether any of the circumstances around any unlawful killings were covered up at any stage’. This is to name just a few. But for some reason, for some unknown reason, Sir Keir Starmer is refusing to hold a 2005 Act public inquiry into the sodomising and rape of working-class white girls. They are not worthy of this human rights lawyer’s time and attention, it seems. Don’t you know there is a Far Right Thug out there tweeting something mean? You know as well as I do that the Old Bill will be down on them quicker than you can say ‘Mind how you go’ to a Muslim rapist who is receiving a sex act from a minor in his car. (Yes, that happened.) No, nothing to see here, says Starmer, we have had all the itty bitty inquiries into these pesky white girls and their abuse that we need. (My words, not his, just to be clear.) Starmer said, in full: ‘There have been a lot of reviews including localised reviews, including into Oldham for example, the mayor of Manchester did his review, and the Jay report was intended to look at the different types of exploitation that went on. It was a comprehensive review . . . This doesn’t need more consultation. It doesn’t need more research. It just needs action.’ Don’t play me for a fool. Sir Keir Starmer KC knows better than anyone that none of these inquiries are the same as a 2005 inquiry with proper terms of reference, focusing on Muslim rape gangs and any possible police corruption, with the power to call witnesses who must give evidence under oath. Starmer doesn’t want an inquiry because he knows awkward things come out in inquiries. Facts. Truth. Logic. And often liberal beliefs can be slayed. No one is going to push Diversity is our Strength, or say that Britain has experienced an ‘integration miracle’, in the words of that half-wit Fraser Nelson, after such an inquiry, I reckon. No British Prime Minister wants to start unravelling the myth of integration or asking some tough questions about the Islamic faith. That could lead to the kind of facts and truth a Prime Minister could do without, thanks very much. The girls who were raped, sodomised, tortured and brutalised by Muslim rape gangs deserve a public inquiry. It is disgraceful that Starmer is refusing to order one. And it is disgusting to label those who call for one as ‘far right’. It seems that the only time a human right lawyer rejects a public inquiry is when it is about Muslim grooming gangs.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-06T14:01:02+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-dare-starmer-reject-a-public-inquiry-into-muslim-grooming-gangs/
Welcome to the year of the 'Quad-demic',"WHEN I WAS a child, we had ‘outbreaks’ of diseases. Living very close to Aberdeen, I miraculously survived the famous (only if you lived near Aberdeen)typhoid outbreak of 1964, which hospitalised hundreds of people. The only thing it killed, temporarily, was the corned beef trade, as the outbreak was traced to a tin of the popularFray Bentos product. Life soon returned to normal, as did the consumption of tinned meats. That was the first and last ‘outbreak’ that I can recall. Almost anything that more than a couple of folks have caught since has been named an ‘epidemic’. That sounded much more threatening, until it was superseded by the term ‘pandemic’, which seems to be the ubiquitous phrase for anything that used to be an epidemic. Trying to distinguish an epidemic from a pandemic is a fruitless task. The definitions seem to differ depending on where you look and, for all intents and purposes, are interchangeable. The problem for the public health brigade is that, clearly, neither term instils sufficient fear into the population, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 fiasco. Admittedly, they rode high for a time. However, very few people, for example, still wear face masks, apart from a few fainthearts, virtue signallers, and those once again mandated by theirNHS employers. Enthusiasm is waning for covid vaccines. Nevertheless, they must be given credit for their tenacity; they simply don’t give up. In their efforts to paralyse us with fear, pepper the joy of the festive season with a little misery and turn our minds towards the perpetual worship of the NHS, we now have a new category of killer to cope with: the ‘quad-demic’. In case you are interested, this is an allegedly lethal cocktail of ‘flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus’. The quad-demic didn’t seem to do the trick, as the irresponsible British public celebrated the birth of Jesus, visited their families and partied like it was 1999. The outcome? According toNHS England, this has resulted in a ‘tidal wave’ of flu and, in a week, a 70 per cent increase in hospital cases. On New Year’s Eve, clearly concerned that we were not listening, the quad-demic has been upgraded with the epithet of‘terrifying’. How do we know this? Apparently,over a quarter of British people, or at least those gullible enough to take a test, have tested positive for influenza. This does not take into account any false positives, which plague this kind of testing, and it does not report how many of these people were symptomatic. In other words, such testing statistics are virtually meaningless. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said that the worst of the tidal wave was on its way. There have been almost4500 flu patients every day, with 211 people in critical care. Therefore, 0.0078% of the population is hospitalised with flu and 0.00037% is in critical care. Expressed like that, the tidal wave seems more like a puddle in a car park. So, why the fuss? Obviously, it is to do with pressure on the NHS which, above all, must be ‘saved’. The usual guilt-inducing measures are employed to imply that it is all our fault, thus it has been reported that the surge in infections will continue to pick up pace in the coming days as a result of more people socialising indoors over the Christmas and the New Year period. Mask-wearing is encouraged, social distancing rears its ugly head and our old favourite lockdown-style measures have been recommended by virologist from the University of Warwick, Professor Lawrence Young. Laughably, it is recommended that you isolate yourself if you have the flu. In my experience, as flu is a near-death experience, the last thing you would want to do is move, eat, drink or speak. Of course, like Covid-19, all things are not equal with flu. It tends not to strike people down in the prime of their lives; the NHS is not overwhelmed with athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts. People in general good health, while not immune to flu, tend to pull through. The usual suspects arethe most vulnerable: I am the last person to play down the severity of flu. I have had it and, as I write, my son, his wife and two of my daughters, both nurses, have it. It is a horrible infection which I sincerely hope to avoid. However,as explained by Dr Clare Craig, flu is not spread asymptomatically, therefore a person testing positive, who has no flu-like symptoms, poses minimal danger to others. Moreover, the flu virus is airborne, meaning that it quickly spreads after a few people with symptoms have it. To cut a long story short, there is very little that anyone can do either to stop it spreading or, once it is spreading, to avoid encountering it. Most people who do encounter the influenza virus will never know it, as their immune systems will deal with it. Attempts by our public health masters to terrify us into submission with the latest ‘demic’ are just that: attempts to terrify us. Given that they know the above facts as well as we do, and that measures such as face masks and lockdowns are futile, we can only speculate about their motives. If only there was a vaccine!",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T15:05:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-quad-demic-christmas-blown-out-of-proportion-and-a-happy-new-year/
How Labour is seizing more control over our children,"NEVER underestimate Labour and their determination to wrest any final vestige of authority and concomitant responsibility from parents and endow it on the oh-so-caring state. Labour’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill has its Second Reading tomorrow and given Labour’s thumping majority it will be voted through. Even Sky News’s reporting of it has been mildly critical. A few days ago it led with‘Parents of the most vulnerable children will lose their right to home education’. This is to understate it. It is a further assault on parents’ freedom from the state regarding the upbringing and education of their children, transferring even more powers from parents to the state – a process started by Tony Blair when he decided to centralise, control and regulate families by a programme which merged protection services and child care with the education system. All parents became potential abusers while abusing parents carried on being ignored. In fact it has failed abysmally to protect children. Now Labour are doubling down on failure with the last bastion of parental authority and autonomy from the state, home schooling, threatened. So never mind how bullied your child is or how much you object to a school’s sex education, gender identity teaching or ‘trans’ policy, or how bad the educational ethos and standards are, your power to take your child out of school is to be heavily circumscribed. I have to apologise on behalf ofTCWfor being asleep at the wheel on this one and letting it slide, despite the formidable Rabbi Asher Gratt keeping me copied in on his almost one-man battle with the Government and his various exchanges with Labour bigwigs over his understandable concerns (as well as to the worse than dismissive responses that he has received). As Rabbi Gratt has pointed out repeatedly, ironically the Bill will undermine the very things you might have supposed the DIE minorities mantra stands for: the rights of minorities, cultural diversity and religious pluralism. In fact it never did. Diversity in ‘multiculti’ state education means one thing and that’s what the woke choose it to mean – as an example, to celebrate Diwali but ban Christmas nativity plays in favour of ‘Winterval’. Demoting Christianity in schools despite its being the country’s religion for nearly two thousand years. The bottom line, however,as Rabbi Gratt detailed last month, is that this Bill is the most repressive and authoritarian of assaults on parents. The most repressive since Tony Blair instigated the nationalisation of children when he merged child protection services with the education system andput every child’s ID into a national computer database in order to monitor their use of services. Of course this did nothing to stop child abuse and neglect, rather it treated all parent as potential abusers. What this Bill (planned under the last Conservative Governments) will once again introduce under the guise of child protection is a nationwide register of all children not attending school, a unique identification number for each child akin to a National Insurance number, and, most disturbingly, a requirement for parents to seek council permission to educate their own children at home if a child is under a child protection plan. It is nothing less than the state seizing control over our children, Gratt says: ‘Under these draconian measures, the government assumes control over children’s education in ways that have never before been seen in the UK. Parents will be forced to “register” their children like property and submit to the authority of local councils to determine whether their education is “suitable”. The Bill not only criminalises conscientious parents who seek to provide an education aligned with their religious or philosophical beliefs, but it also sets a dangerous precedent for the erosion of fundamental civil liberties.’ Ironically again, the Bill appears to be in direct violation of parents’ rights as enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees parents the right to educate their children in accordance with their own religious and philosophical beliefs. Perhaps the most shocking measure is the introduction of a unique identifier for every child in England, a ‘child-tracking number’ which will be used across services to monitor and log the child’s every movement, akin to a social credit system. Gratt cites civil liberties groups calling this provision ‘deeply chilling’ and reminiscent of surveillance measures seen in authoritarian regimes. The government claims that these measures are necessary for ‘child protection’. Critics argue it is state overreach on an unimaginable scale. Rabbi Gratt is far from alone in his concerns. The activist education groupEducational Freedom are concerned that the right to home educate is seriously at risk, pointing to the Children’s Commissioner’s chilling explanation of the purpose of the register: ‘If we get proper registers and we have our local authorities taking their responsibilities seriously to engage with these families, we may find that we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be.’ Furthermore they point out that if you choose to home educate you now ‘have to demonstrate your home environment is safe even if your education provision is top notch’. So it proposes in effect to circumvent other legislation to remove parental responsibility by the back door. What constitutes ‘safe’ in a home? Their other concern is that it does nothing to support parents to protect their children ‘when the school environment is enabling them to be harmed’. As Gratt points out in his article, for decades parents in the UK have been able to educate their children at home without interference, ‘a right that is rooted in centuries of common law. It is not just that if a child is under a child protection plan that the parents must seek council permission to continue home education, the measure effectively treats all home parents as suspects under constant surveillance, undermining the presumption of parental competence and good faith’. Both Gratt and Educational Freedom believe the Bill has profound consequences for vulnerable families, particularly those dealing with medical or special educational needs (SEN) children: ‘By forcing parents to seek permission from council authorities, this Bill threatens to reduce the flexibility and personalisation that home education provides for children with complex needs.’ This is nothing less than a surveillance state in disguise. As Gratt says, it is not about education quality, but about control, ‘something you expect in authoritarian regimes, not in a democratic society’.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-07T13:42:16+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-labour-is-seizing-more-control-over-our-children/
Multiculturalism slays Rotherham's young girls,"Warnings, published in this article all the way back in 2014, of the dangers and consequences of multiculturalism, have been there for all to see. AsLaura Perrins so cogently arguedlast week,establishment elites have ignored them.Which is why, for the record, we decided David’s spot on critique was too important to be allowed to moulder in the archive. IT’S ALMOST beyond parody, but the motto of Rotherham Council emblazoned on all its communications to the outside world that it is a metropolitan borough ‘where everyone matters’. The grubby, right-on fingerprints of NewLabour’s approach to ‘public relations’ are all over the phrase. Let’s put the abuse figure into context. According to the local Children’s Safeguarding Board2012-3 annual reportthere are 62,000 children in the area. 49% of the total are girls, so that means almost one in 20 of local girls was subject to abuse. Actually the percentage is slightly higher because the figures also cover the 16-18 age bracket. Alexis Jay– a prominent social worker in Scotland at the highest levels – minces no words in hertotally shocking report. What was being wickedly perpetrated on these vulnerable girls should have been glaringly obvious to all the relevant public-purse agencies from police to social services. But individually and collectively, they did nothing.- other than frequently to pour scorn on those who tried to report their torment. And the reason? Obviously in such complex cause and effect, there were many, but, to me, one paragraph leaps out beyond all others in the Jay report. It’s this: ‘By far the majority of perpetrators were described as ‘Asian’ by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.’ In other words – untold, incalculable human misery has been caused because the authorities that should have cared about human welfare and bringing to justice these Asian gangs thought it was far more important not be seen as racist. As I write these words, I am incandescent with rage that this is happening in Britain. How can it be that those alleged public servants paid vast sums and provided with lavish pensions to protect the vulnerable could so blatantly prioritise issues of race above dealing with the unspeakable crimes detailed in the report? Already the sound of wriggling off the multiple hooks in the report can be heard. True, the leader of Rotherham Council has resigned, and true Ms Jay says there have been recent improvements in children’s safeguarding. But elsewhere, the signs are that former children’s minister Tim Loughton’s demand that everyone involved in this horrendous scandal should resign are being ignored. With total brass neck effrontery, the police commissioner involved has apologised it happened on his watch, but says he will carry on. And on past form he will. It was Rotherham Council, let us not forget, which in 2012 became embroiled in another major scandal centred on racism, when its social services department decided that two perfectly loving and qualified adults could not continue to provide foster care for Eastern European children because they were members of UKIP. The woman at the centre of that scandal was Joyce Thacker, Rotherham’s strategic director of children’s and young people’s services. Back then, she defended the decision. Her position was that anyone opposed to uncontrolled Eastern European immigration could not be a loving parent. Two years on, she is still in post, and now there is irrefutable evidence from the Jay report that the decision was not taken in isolation – those responsible for children’s services and protection in Rotherham (they are listed on p38-9 of the Safeguarding Board’s annual report) – seemingly put fears about being branded racist ahead of the wellbeing of children. Multiculturalism was the mantra of New Labour when it was elected in 1997, the year when this catalogue of abuse began. What’s massively clear from its pages – and the lesson we must all now digest – is that this creed of political correctness has introduced a vicious cancer into our public institutions and into the mindset of our public servants. Yes, racism is a poison. But the pursuit of multiculturalism leads to consequences that are far, far worse.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-05T01:18:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-multiculturalism-slays-rotherhams-young-girls/
Fraser Nelson turns a blind eye to broken Britain,"IN WHAT I can only assume was a final act of revenge on theTelegraphbefore moving to theTimes,Fraser Nelson served up one of the worst pieces written by any journalist anywhere on Planet Earth in 2024. This includes Justine McCarthy and Fintan O’Toole at theIrish Times. On Boxing Day or St Stephen’s Day, depending on which side of the Irish Sea you are reading this, Nelson gave us this gem: ‘Britain’s integration miracle is a beacon of hope amid instability. Keir Starmer talks doom and gloom, but this is an amazing country – never more so than now.’ If that headline left you dreading what was to come, your instincts were correct. Nelson informs us: ‘For decades, the British Crime Survey has gauged how many crimes have taken place, reported or not. It shows assault and neighbourhood crime down by 50 per cent over 15 years, bicycle theft down by 60 per cent over 15 years and criminal damage down by 75 per cent. Some crimes (snatch thefts,knife crimes)are rising, but in the context of a stunning overall decline. Our immigrant population has almost doubled while our crime rate has halved.’ (My emphasis.) I don’t think there is a single person in Britain who believes the streets are safer. Not a single one. Knife crime is indeed on the increase although Fraser Nelson seems to skip over this fact. Also, which would you prefer, a decrease in bicycle theft or an increase in knife crime? Would you prefer criminal damage (a minor offence against property) to decrease but knife crime increase? No, of course not. Most people would like to see knife crime decrease but it has been increasing in Britain. Much hangs on that termknife crime. It can include anything from murder with a knife, manslaughter to stabbing in the form of either GBH or ABH. In the year that saw the son of Rwandan immigrants accused of stabbing to death three schoolgirls in Southport (not the Welsh Christian choirboy the media first went with) I don’t know how anyone could write that Britain has seen an ‘integration miracle’. Sure ‘knife crime’ has increased, just ask the parents of Bebe King, aged six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, who never made it to Christmas 2024 ‘because of integration’ or something. In fact, on Christmas Day itself two women were stabbed to death. TheTimesreported: ‘A man has appeared in court charged with two counts of murder after two women died on Christmas Day following a knife attack. Jazwell Brown, 49, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, appeared at High Wycombe magistrates’ court on Saturday. Joanne Pearson, 38, and Teohna Grant, 24, died after an altercation at a flat in Bletchley.Both women were from Milton Keynes.’ Somehow, after a year that saw the torture and killing of ten-year-old Sara Sharif at the hands of her Pakistani father, Fraser Nelson was able to type the following: ‘But we seem to have attracted immigrants who, by and large, are prone to integrate and strengthen the social fabric. The secret sauce is our concept of Britishness, which is not about ethnicity or religion but a way of life with global appeal. It’s a set of values that anyone can adopt.’ A set of values that includes a two-tier criminal justice system that is very accommodating to certain groups of criminals.Just ask the girls of Rochdale or the mother of Sara Sharif. Then we had this: ‘This is not to deny the existence of serious problems, or jihadist nutcases. But the British experience is defined by smaller, less spectacular things that seldom make the news. A reminder came on Christmas Day, when Liverpool FC’s Mohamed Salah, perhaps the best footballer in the Premier League, posted a picture of his family in matching pyjamas under a Christmas tree. He does this every year: to annoy the trolls who fume that, as an observant Muslim and captain of Egypt’s national team, he should not be joining Yuletide festivities. As his picture gently shows, such petty sectarianism is just not the British way.’ So, all is OK in Blighty. There is no issue with Islamic extremism. Proof of this is some millionaire Muslim footballer who likes to put the whole family in Christmas-themed jim-jams. So, those who have an issue with acid attacks, slaughtered schoolgirls, or tortured ten-year-olds are the deluded ones. Not the journalist who writes this kind of stuff. Nelson continues: ‘To understand the long-term prospects of a country, look at its birth rates. Italy has just recorded its lowest ever . . . Britain is the only major European country not heading for a working-age population decline.’ Now this sentence is another way of cooking the books. Britain has experienced a fertility crash the same as the rest of Europe, concealed only by immigration. Let’s look at Britain’s birth rates. They have been below replacement level for years and 2024 saw births outstripped by deaths for the first time in 50 years.Go on though, Fraser, tell me again about the cause for optimism. The underlying assumption seems to be that we can just import more workers, who somehow stay forever young and never get old themselves. It’s a plan, not a very good one, but a plan. Nelson then talks about the lack of far-right groups in Britain (someone should inform Starmer of that) and finishes with: ‘This is an amazing country – never more so than now. It may be an act of defiance to say it in this era of Starmer miserabilism, but we really do have more reasons than ever to wish each other a Happy New Year.’ Look, I understand if you have had too much port over Christmas and you are writing your final column for a paper which has done doom and gloom better than any all year. Sure, you want to end on a high, but the truth is that Britainwasan amazing country;it was until the governing elites, including Conservative governments, trashed it with out-of-control immigration numbers. Tory governments also permitted woke beliefs to infect every institution that matters including the police, and oversaw a collapse in law and order and the rise of a two-tier criminal justice system. The tax burden is the highest it has been since the war. Yes, it was a great country, I enjoyed living there for 20 years but some of the above is the reason why I moved the whole family back to Ireland over a year ago.The decline has been hard to watch. What annoys me about Fraser Nelson’s article is that he is conservative royalty. He is part of the conservative media establishment in the UK. If he doesn’t speak up for the ordinary British man and woman who are not on board with the elite trashing of their country, defeat is inevitable. Journalists such as Nelson should be speaking up and defending the unique cultural character of Britain. Sure, immigrants can integrate but the scale of immigration in recent years will make this next to impossible and many have utterly failed to integrate. Media elites in the UK who declare that there is nothing to see here other than some footballer wearing a very fetching pair of pyjamas is not just bad journalism, it is an insult to those who have seen their country given away and have no power to stop it. It is a betrayal. Badly done by Fraser Nelson, badly done.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-30T01:21:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/nelson-turns-a-blind-eye-to-broken-britain/
Major study confirms covid jab harms mental health,"A STUDY of millions of citizens shows that covid vaccination ‘significantly increased’ the risks for depression, anxiety, various stress disorders and sleep problems. The same study showed the vaccinations ‘significantly decreased’ the risk for developing bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Two South Koreanuniversities randomly selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) claims database more than two million (2,154,189) Seoul citizens aged 20 and older who had received two doses of covid vaccines, and 350,983 unvaccinated subjects. Researchers excluded any with a history of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, dissociative, stress related, somatoform (SSD) or psychosomatic disorders (these are mental health conditions where people experience physical symptoms in response to psychological distress), sleep, eating and sexual disorders. This meant excluding almost half a million in the vaccinated group (435,390) and 42,629 in the unvaccinated group. The final number was 1,718,999 vaccinated subjects and 308,354 non-vaccinated subjects. Post covid infection mental health issues had been studied extensively but not post covid vaccination mental adverse events. This study redressed the balance, and the researchers concluded: ‘Our population-based cohort study provides robust evidence for psychiatric adverse events (AEs) after covid-19 vaccinations. Furthermore, our study provided risks of psychiatric AEs according to vaccine type, revealing that the psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders) with increased risks due to covid-19 vaccination showed the highest risk in the case of heterogeneous vaccination.’ Heterogenous vaccination means a combination of vaccine types, for example Pfizer combined with AstraZeneca. Study flowchart The results were published in the respected journalNatureand produced by scientists from Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital and Ewha Womans University Hospital. Scientists assessed 10,000 psychiatric adverse events over one and two weeks, then at one month and three months, and concluded that: ‘Covid-19 vaccination increased the risks of depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders while reducing the incidence and risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.’ It had no effect on sexual disorders or eating disorders, they said. They added: ‘Our findings suggested that the relationship between covid-19 vaccination and mental illness may be underestimated along with the complexity of its impact on mental health.’ The paper contained no case studies but there are many published, like this one from Indian scientists at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. A pro-vaccine, 18-year-old female student with no history of psychiatric problems, physical illness or substance abuse, and no family history of mental illness, was taken to accident and emergency (A&E) after reacting to her covid vaccination. Family members described her behaviour as bizarre and her conversation confused. Within three hours of receiving a Covishield, India’s version of the AstraZeneca vaccination, she developed a high fever and diarrhoea. Neither improved with medication. She then became dizzy and disorientated and fell. Her fever subsided the following day, but she developed anxiety, insomnia and petit-mal seizures where she would stare into space. Over the next four days she was irritable, incoherent, and suffered delusions – she felt persecuted and experienced hallucinations with gods and demons. She tried to run away from home. At their wits end, her family took her back to A&E. Before being vaccinated, she had no history of seizures, delusions or depression and was on no medication. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and had not had covid. Doctors gave her a battery of blood and urine tests that showed no abnormalities or provided any other explanation for her sudden-onset mental health issues. A 31-year-old Hispanic male who worked as an office manager, was studied by scientists at Stony Brook University, New York. He had no history of mental illness or physical illness but was taken to A&E by police, exhibiting ‘erratic and bizarre behaviour’. He told nursing staff he was clairvoyant, was talking to dead people and could hear people drumming outside his house. He also heard the constant voice of a co-worker who he believed was his girlfriend although in reality, he was not in a relationship with her. He presented as anxious and guarded and was described by medical staff as ‘superficial and grandiose.’ His symptoms began after receiving his first mRNA covid-19 vaccine and worsened after his second dose.Both patients are said to have recovered after treatment. Psychosis has been reported after existing vaccines like rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhoid and flu. The award-winning BBC foreign correspondentMalcolm Brabantwas in his fifties when he described how he descended into madness after a routine yellow fever vaccine in 2011. He became unwell within hours of receiving the jab and said he endured ‘two years of unimaginable mental torment’ – he was unrecognisable to his family and friends. He heard voices urging him to kill, believed he was the Messiah come to save the world while at the same time believing he was Lucifer. He was convinced that dead relatives urged him to drink his urine or eat his own excrement or brush his teeth with a lavatory brush. He recovered after several years but not before he was given electroconvulsive therapy and attempted suicide. Sanofi-Pasteur manufactured the yellow fever vaccine he received and although admit to reports of side-effects including mental disorders, said they were ‘rare’ and unlikely to have caused Brabant’s psychosis. What mechanism can cause mental health issues to appear post-vaccination? There is limited data, but reports indicate that mental health issues could be caused by autoimmune encephalitis – inflammation of the brain caused by the body’s immune system attacking healthy brain cells. The Stony Brook University researchers said that the disease covid-19 was also linked with psychotic symptoms and that 42 cases had been reported by January 2021. They hypothesised that covid-19 triggered a powerful immune response which resulted in a cytokine storm that could increase the risk of psychosis. University of Oxfordresearchers produced the graph below illustrating the increase in mental health outcomes after covid infection. Their study, also published inNature,said that the unvaccinated had an increased risk of developing psychosis rather than a decreased risk. Fear was a huge factor during covid, and the Indian researchers recognised that lockdowns, social distancing, financial insecurity, the fear of getting infected and future uncertainty, contributed to mental health issues. There is no doubt that existing conditions like anxiety, depression, grief, obsessive compulsive disorder, and psychosis worsened as the psyops surrounding the pandemic increased. However, pandemic onset mental health issues should largely have resolved in the vaccinated who would have been relieved they were protected and looked forward to ‘getting back to normal’. Those who were vaccinated were sure that vaccines were the answer to their problems and would not be the cause of new ones. For that reason alone, the South Korean study is compelling. It showed that mental health issues increased in the vaccinated, rather than decreased as would be expected. It also showed that the unvaccinated, despite being branded granny killers and refuseniks, and under intense psyop pressure to conform, did not develop the same mental health issues.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-16T09:18:30+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/major-study-confirms-covid-jab-harms-mental-health/
"Why was Sara’s sadistic, murderous father not stopped? We all know why","MR Justice Cavanagh excused the jury inthe Sara Sharif murder trialfrom further jury service for life. This isn’t a regular occurrence. He did so because of the horrific evidence that they had to hear during the eight-week trial.The judge told the jury: ‘I know a murder trial is always stressful and traumatic but this case almost above any other has been extremely stressful and traumatic. You have performed your duty magnificently. I’m acutely aware the evidence you had to sit through has been very distressing and you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t find it upsetting.’ Yesterday Mr Justic Cavanagh jailed Sara’s 43-year-old father Urfan Sharif for a minimum of 40 years and her stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, for 33 years for the ten-year-old’s murder. Sharif’s brother Faisal Malik, 29, who was found guilty of causing or allowing Sara’s death was sentenced to 16 years. What you must understand about the tragedy of Sara is not just that she was murdered in the most brutal and sadistic fashion possible. She was also tortured for her short life before her evil father finally ended her time on earth. In a trial of many horrifying details, surely this admission by Urfan Sharif in the witness box was the worst. Something that if you were a juror would stay with you until the end of your days. ‘In a shocking admission to the court which left jurors open-mouthed, Sharif admitted to throttling her with his bare hands and battering her with a cricket bat, metal pole and mobile phone,even whacking her in the stomach as she lay dying.’ If you saw someone do this to a dog, you would rightly conclude they were monsters. Now imagine doing it to a ten-year-old girl. This was the final sadistic assault on Sara at home in Woking, Surrey, by the person who was supposed to protect her. ‘The schoolgirl suffered dozens of serious wounds including human bite marks and iron burns, as well as multiple fractures and a traumatic brain injury.’ There will be the usual reviews and inquiries. But let’s cut to the chase. This time it wasn’t the fault of the social workerswho from my reading of things intervened and raised alarms time and again. The police were involved, social services were involved, teachers made complaints. And every single one was ignored. The problem was no one with any actual power was willing to stand up to Urfan Sharif. There were two critical points in the short life of Sara Sharif where if different decisions were made, this little girl might not have been tortured to death. The first goes back to before she was born. ‘The local authority brought care proceedings for the children seven days before Sara was born. In a case summary of care proceedings, solicitors for Surrey County council said social workers had concerns regarding the care provided by Sharif and [Sara’s mother, Olga] Domin and that children were not adequately supervised.’ After her birth, Sara spent a week with her mother in hospital before being taken into foster care. She was made subject to a child protection plan. Her parents were allowed to see her three times a week. Urfan Sharif had already been arrested on suspicion of attacking three women including Olga Domin, as well as hitting and biting two children. Police stated there was not enough evidence to charge Sharif despite each woman’s similar claims. At the hearing just after Sara was born a report to the family court concluded: ‘Whilst the guardian is satisfied that there may be reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm . . . the advantages of the children remaining at home should [be] weighed against the potential harm to the children of removal, particularly to Sara as a newborn child, before we have a full assessment and understanding of these children and their parents’ ability to meet their individual needs.’ The guardian is an independent person appointed by the court to give advice. This person found that the test to remove a child, namely that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm, was fulfilled. But then they go on to hedge their bets and talk of the potential harm of removing Sara as a newborn. What absolute nonsense is this? The family were already known to the authorities for violence including serious domestic abuse. The advantages to Sara in remaining in that family were that she was tortured for ten years and then brutally murdered by her father and stepmother. What is more infuriating is that newborn babies are the easiest ones to place for adoption – couples want them. But no, the family court left her in the care of her mother and sadistic father. The worst decision was yet to come. The father and mother separated and now Urfan Sharif was with Beinash Batool. Asthe Telegraph reports:‘The Family Court gave Sara Sharif’s killer father shared custody of his daughter despite knowing he had been accused of abusing her siblings for years. In October 2019, almost four years before Sara was killed, the couple had been awarded shared custody of her by the Family Court. ‘Sara’s mother, who has learning difficulties, had given her consent for the children to be looked after by Batool and Sharif. Allegations of abuse and neglect had been made against both Ms Domin and Sharif at the time. This decision amounted to the death sentence of Sara Sharif.’ Or asthe Times reports,after a history of allegations of abuse being made, ‘Sharif applies to Guildford family court for custody of Sara. Sara had made a claim of abuse by Domin and Surrey council supported returning her to her father. Sharif is given custody of Sara.’ And that was that. I hope that the family judge has a very happy Christmas indeed. I understand it can be hard to keep up, between the child protection plans, and the allegations of domestic violence, and the allegation of abuse by three different women against Urfan Sharif, and the allegations of burning children. For instance, in 2015 there was the following allegation. ‘Sharif is reported to social services for waving a knife around at home in what he says was a “zombie” game. Social workers note that Sharif hit and kicked Domin at home and the pair threaten to kill each other.’ Do not be confused between this hearing at that family court, and the test to be satisfied, and who said what about whom. Let’s just keep this simple. If Urfan Sharif was called John Smith or Gregg Wallace and had this kind of history, I do not believe he would have been awarded custody of his daughter Sara in 2019. But because his name is Urfan Sharif he can do whatever the hell he wants, especially to women and children, and no one says stop. Other women, such as social workers or teachers, might try to stop him, but they are ignored. These men from Pakistan come over to Britain on a nonsense study visa or work visa or whatever it is,and they do whatever the hell they like. They can rape their way through Rotherham and Oxford, and no one says stop. They can traffic working-class white girls and rape them for years on end and no one says stop. They can threaten to set them on fire, or lock them in cages, and it will take years for the police to take action. Years. And they can import their first cousin from their village in Pakistan to marry them, and that’s fine too. There’s no push-back until now, and when a scientist conducts research into how damaging cousin-marriage is, it gets memory-holed. We all know why Sara Sharif, trapped in the family home after a family court judge awarded her abusive and sadistic father custody of her tiny body, ‘was the victim of repeated beatings and scaldings, forced to leave school and carry out laundry chores for her stepmother while wearing a hijab to obscure her growing number of bruises and wounds’. We all know why ‘a post-mortem examination revealed the horrific nature of Sara’s death. Sara had endured 71 recent injuries, which included bleeding on her brain, multiple bruises on her lungs, a rare broken hyoid bone in her neck, and a large area of ulceration across her buttocks from an iron burn. Human bite marks were present across her body, with the evidence indicating that she had been hooded, beaten and restrained while scalding water had been poured over her ankles.’ This happened because Diversity is our Strength. We would not want to upset the multi-culti apple cart, would we? Wouldn’t want to point out that there can be vast cultural differences between immigrants. That would be racist. Even writing this might make me a Far-Right Thug.Remember it is much more important to sentence English grandfathers to entirely disproportionate sentences for Far-Right Thuggery than it is to charge and jail domestic abusers from Pakistan. Domestic abusers who treat women like trash. I don’t know about you but I really have had enough of this Diversity is our Strength derangement syndrome. I’d settle for the basic principle that everyone is equal before the law, so that if you are accused of extremely serious offences, you are charged and tried, not awarded custody of your daughter who you go on to torture and murder. So, TCW reader, save yourself the hassle of reading the case review: I can tell you what will be in it. Chances missed. He was clever and manipulative. Blah blah blah. You know why Urfan Sharif got away with it for so long. I know why he got away with it for so long. And so do those who had multiple chances to save Sara Sharif from a life and death of unrelenting cruelty, barbarity and sadism. Shame on them. Sara Sharif. Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.Amen. (By the way, for the hard of learning, do not bother telling me I never write on white child murders as nothing could be further from the truth. I wrote about those twohereandhere. But we are stuck with our native child killers. So I don’t see why we have to import more.)",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:22:00+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-was-saras-sadistic-murderous-father-not-stopped-we-all-know-why/
Stories from the illegal migrant frontline,"DESPITE what this inept and impotent Labour government will tell you, illegal economic migrants (to describe them as ‘irregular’ is a total misnomer, since they ‘regularly’ arrive here) continue to enter the UK via the Kent, Sussex and Essex coast. Meanwhile, as the Tories did before, the Labour government continue to lie about and obfuscate the actual figures arriving. Yes, they are head counting those being disembarked at Dover docks. But they are not, however, acknowledging the regular sightings by locals on the Kent coast of those coming in by the ‘back door’. Many people think illegal landings occur only by ‘water taxi’, via the RNLI and Border Force, but this is a fallacy. Dinghy-loads of illegal migrant men are regularly seen around Dungeness in Kent, and on other stretches of the 440 miles of Kent and Sussex coastline, much of which is remote. And yet these invaders (let’s call them what they are, for they will attempt if possible to come in under the radar, and they also dispose of their identity papers whilst crossing) have the effrontery to enter quite openly, even near to the houses that dot the coast. They then proceed to run across gardens and fields, many to pre-arranged (by GPS) waiting vehicles, usually driven by ‘associates’ already installed here. Dungeness, where in recent years I have taken many photos of illegal migrant landings, is an amazing area comprising 12 square miles of deserted cuspate foreland – the open country around it affording cover and a good escape route for migrants entering by this back door. Landings by lifeboat here have become infrequent; stopped by the authorities in 2023 because of the presence of a number of citizens and freelance and Press Association journalists. The inept Tory government didn’t want them recorded. Nowadays, these occur only in extenuating circumstances, for example if someone on board is suffering from hypothermia, Dungeness being the nearest landfall for an ambulance. The fact, however, that it is a beach and Crown Property has meant people line me could carry on legally filming theunaccompaniedlandings of non-taxied individuals coming ashore illegally. On these occasions, often overnight or in the early hours of the morning, most present were local people, like me. A number of us have access to marine traffic apps and gadgetry that can monitor transponder messages between lifeboats and Border Force, and so we knew when a landing was imminent. we have watched how, without the aid of Border Force or the RNLI, these illegals arriving by stealth and disappear unmonitored into the Kent and Sussex landscapes. It is a recurring problem – their dinghies float back into the Channel on the outgoing tide, causing danger and nuisance to other Channel traffic. Besides being a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Dungeness is home to a large power station in the process of being decommissioned, an airport, and an Army firing range – three obviously major security risks, all of them having been compromised in the past. For example, during a raid on the airport in August 2023‘crucial evidence about people-smuggling operations in the Channel was stolen’. Back in October 2020 at nearby Lydd Ranges a powerful nine-metre speedboat made landfall on the MoD beach in the middle of a target-practice session,which had to be halted. The following photographs, all taken by me, depict the general demeanour of migrant men when they arrive in the ‘Land of Plenty’, clad in their designer gear and armed with new mobile phones and new SIM cards programmed with lists of freebies available to them – and where to get them! You will notice in these images a distinct lack of women and children, although we do see them occasionally; the children are often screaming in fear, and I witnessed one particular horror of a toddler who came in on a lifeboat full of men, none of whom were related to him – his screams and the terror on his little face will live with me forever. Take time to look closely at these pictures – I leave it to you to decide whether these individuals are from war-torn or famine-stricken countries – also whether they deserve to be fed, clothed and housed by the British taxpayer whilst our elderly freeze in their homes and ex-servicemen lay their heads for the night in shop doorways. August 2022 This is of Katie Sweetingham, a Care4Calais volunteer handing out bulk-bought tracksuits to the new arrivals, who are mostly clad in designer clothing from North Face, Gucci and Prada. Sheonce told a French newspaper, ‘Obviously, it’s my priority to supervise them even before their arrival, to make them disappear from the sight of citizens and the media.’ (use Google Translate) August 2022 A French SIM-card frame discarded by a migrant. Supplied by charities in Calais with new SIM cards, pre-programmed with details of where to get benefits (and often new phones), migrants discard old SIM cards overboard during crossings, along with old smartphones, because they are likely to contain incriminating information about their journeys. Some wash up on the shore. March 2020 The sparse landscape of Dungeness with the power station and old lighthouse in the distance, perfect landmarks for those wishing to enter ‘under the radar’. Dungeness is about 21 miles from Cap Gris-Nez in Northern France. October 2023 An arrival at Dungeness showing all-male passengers. October 2023 A young girl (employed by a security company) passes by, provoking a reaction from the all-male illegal incomers. On this particular day only she, another girl colleague and one man were present. There were no police there to make arrests. The two girls were instructed to go to the men and ask them if they were carrying knives, scissors, or other weapons. I witnessed this. October 2023 Smiling faces of men safe in the expectation of warm beds and three meals a day plus extra spending money. No sign of destitution, hunger, or illness – and no sign of the gratitude or humility shown by genuine refugees – which refugees should surely include women and children. October 2023 As early as 2019 these posters had become evident around the area, although they are not seen so much now, despite the coast still being an open target for illegal incomers. Around 4.30am in June 2022 The boat has to be trailered up the sloping beach as the tide is out. May 2022: This is a landing in the early hours. This time children were evident. Highly dangerous by day and worse by night in poor visibility, given large vessels are active around the clock. Recently a two-year-old was trampled to death in a dinghy during a night crossing. Several children have died during crossings – possibly some we don’t know about. May 2022 The illegal migrants are shown here in their waterproofs (which I believe are reused) issued – I was told by a Border Force officer – by the government. Even before the migrants set foot on dry land, this whole exercise has cost thousands of pounds and, sometimes, lives. October 2023: Migrant men, arrogance evident on their faces, as they pass me to board the air-conditioned coach hired to ferry them to the processing centre and thence to hotel accommodation. I am not sure what the gesture on the right means, but they have been seen giving the one-fingered ISIS salute. May 2022: A young migrant man sporting Gucci jeans (which, my research revealed, cost £660 a pair). I rest my case.

The climate scaremongers: Met Office fiddles the figures over Storm Darragh,"THE Met Office is gaslighting us. Last weekend Storm Darragh swept through the country, the Met Office leading the charge with the headline‘Storm Darragh brings 90mph gusts and heavy rain’. The media faithfully followed suit with similarly apocalyptic claims, which probably came as a surprise to most people who thought it was just a typical spell of wet and windy weather. After all, winds that strong are truly exceptional, the sort that swept across large swathes of the country during the Burns Day storm in 1990. So where did these 90mph winds actually occur? The Met Office were quick to tell us! What the Met Office forgot to tell you was that all of these are in extremely exposed locations, and are far from typical of the country at large. Berry Head, for instance, is on the top of cliffs near Brixham, Devon, next to a lighthouse station and on an Iron Age hilltop fort. Capel Curig is high in the middle of Snowdonia, and Aberdaron is on another clifftop on the Llyn Peninsula. If you want representative wind speeds, you certainly don’t measure them in places like these, any more than you would use the temperature on the Centre Court of Wimbledon. In meteorological terms, they are meaningless. Their only purpose is to generate headlines. And sure enough, wind speeds in places where people actually live were considerably lower. At Exeter Airport, for instance, just along the coast from Berry Head, gusts reached 58mph at most. In Rhyl, the area where the storm hit hardest, winds hit 60mph. Very windy, yes – but no more than the sort of weather we get every winter. To put Storm Darragh into perspective, Aberdaron holds the record for gusts in North Wales – 112mph in 1997. Darragh by contrast brought winds of 92mph there. If you check back through the Met Office archives, you can see that they never used to report on exposed locations such as these when reporting the weather. They knew that wind speeds there had no relevance. Indeed, it cannot be pure coincidence that their weather stations at Berry Head, Capel Curig, Aberdaron and Pembrey Sands were all opened in 1993. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these and others, such as the Needles on the Isle of Wight, were introduced around this time to inflate wind speeds for purposes of propaganda. We know that in recent years the Met Office has been busy setting up new temperature stations which are so poorly sited that they can read up to 5C too high. The transparent purpose is to be able to advertise higher temperatures. It is also now equally apparent that they are misrepresenting wind speeds for reasons of propaganda as well. There is a serious side to all this. In the past, people accepted that weather like this was normal. As a consequence, they were prepared and took sensible precautions when a storm was on its way. Nowadays, many have been conditioned to believe that the gales seen this week are exceptional. As a result, they are unprepared and panic. Stormy weather 100 years ago WITHOUT wishing to labour the point, it is no coincidence that we had the same bad weather exactly 100 years ago, as the Met Office’s Monthly Weather Report for December 1924 reveals. (They used to be called ‘Weather Reports’, but in 2001 the Met Office started calling them ‘Monthly Climate Summaries’, proving that they don’t understand the difference between WEATHER and CLIMATE!) You could of course look up virtually any year and you would find windy weather like this at some time in winter.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-13T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-met-office-fiddles-the-figures-over-storm-darragh/
Electric armoured vehicles? Net zero chance of that,"THERE have been several noises in the recent past about ‘decarbonising’ warfare. For instance, in 2021 the then chief of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston,set a target for British military aircraft to hit net-zero carbon by 2040. Another example is the plan set out in 2020 by the US military to have electric armoured vehicles, reported inPopular Mechanics under the heading ‘The Electric Vehicle Revolution Is Finally Hitting the US Army’. Now it is reported that in the UK‘Ministers are forging ahead with plans to use electric vehicles (EVs) for combat on the battlefield despite warnings from military grandees that they could put the Armed Forces at risk’. Let’s take a look at the facts of the matter. First, aChallenger 2 tank weighs 64 tonnes and carries around 1,600 litres of fuel (16 MWh energy) weighing 1.3 tonnes and is expected to have a range of 300 miles. As a rough guide, let us use theTesla S long-range car: 2,100 kg weight, 100 kWh/544 Kg battery pack and a 300 miles range. By extrapolation, the Challenger tank will need a 3 MWh (64*0.1/2.1) battery weighing 17 tonnes. A Tesla Supercharger at 250 kW will take 12 hours to charge it. Anyway, where and how will it be charged in a combat zone?! Similarly, alight armoured vehicle (L-ATV) weighs 4,667 kg, with a range of 300 miles and has dimensions of 6.2m length, 2.5m width. Again, compared with the Tesla S, the L-ATV will need a battery of at least 220 kWh (100*4667/2100) capacity. Under ‘peak sun’,modern solar panels can produce 300 W per square metre. So, if the L-ATV has to be charged by solar energy, it has to be parked under ‘peak sun’ for about 48 hours to charge the battery, even if its entire top surface is covered by solar panels (220/[0.3 × 6.2 × 2.5]). It is also to be hoped that no rocks will be thrown at it by miscreants on the battlefield! Themaximum take-off weight (MTOW) of a Eurofighter (Typhoon) aircraft is 21,000 kg and it carries 4,000 kg of fuel with an energy content of 49 MWh. A battery pack with the same energy content would weigh around 13 times the MTOW of the aircraft, assuming a battery pack energy density of 5.44 kg/kWh, taking Tesla S as the guide. It is to be remembered that there are hardly any efficiency gains from running jet engines on batteries. It should be obvious that using electric vehicles for combat on the battlefield is a very silly idea. The reason appears to be that the government has pledged to put net zero goals at the centre of its defence industrial strategy. Astonishingly, a government source has said that ‘new and emerging technologies can support decarbonisation efforts and improve battlefield capability, reducing the supply chain vulnerability of liquid fuel and also reducing the heat signature and noise of vehicles on the battlefield’. Never mind that it will clearly erode battlefield capability and increase supply chain vulnerability. For instance, will an adequate charging infrastructure be first established in the field before any battle is fought? People with common sense in the military have already called it a‘crazy endeavour’and recognise this as nothing more than virtue signalling by the MoD. It is a pity a lot of money will be wasted on such idiotic ideas in pursuit of ‘net zero’.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:59:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/electric-armoured-vehicles-net-zero-chance-of-that/
War on Microbes: The murky agenda behind the covid ‘pandemic’,"THE biodefense mafia don’t really care whether zoonosis (a disease passed from animals to humans) or a lab leak was to blame for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They just want you to believe there was a pandemic and restrict causation to one of those two options. It’s a false binary. Either explanation is a win for them because what they’re really doing is setting an elephant trap. The objective is to perpetuate the ‘War on Microbes’, a taxpayer-subsidised pharma racket in which finding or inventing viruses in order pre-emptively to invent countermeasure vaccines can continue ad infinitum. Either excuse serves their purpose. On December 4, 2024, the House of Representatives sub-committee on the Coronavirus Pandemicreleased a 557-page report, ‘After-Action Review on the Covid-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and a Path Forward’. Its finding? ‘A lab leak is the most likely origin scenario, that the Chinese Communist Party was conducting dangerous research, and this type of dangerous research was notionally supported by the NIH [US National Institutes of Health],’ said Chairman Brad Wenstrup. The conclusion was perhaps no surprise as Wenstrup, a podiatrist and US Army reservist who served in Iraq in 2005, was in 2021 amongst the first outside Dr Robert Kadlec’s biodefense clique to push for a lab leak investigation. What the US now euphemistically calls ‘gain of function’ work used to be called bioweapons research. Kadlec invoked the right for the US to do it in 2003, justifying it as defensive threat detection work. However for the countermeasure part to be legal under international law, it needs an illegal act by another state to respond to, so someone else needs to be doing it too. Funding Chinese government research into zoonotic viruses is perhaps a second elephant trap as it sets up future scapegoats. For the pharma companies it’s a win-win too. The US War on Microbes business model calls for outsourcing of vaccine development projects to private companies whose development costs are completely underwritten by the government, whose own researchers get a small kickback in the form of royalty payments while Pharma gets to keep most of the profits from the commercialised product. It’s a merger of state and corporate interests. Left to a free enterprise model, we wouldn’t be where we are because there is no viable commercial market for these War on Microbes vaccines. News coverage on the committee report has largely focused on speculation that perjury charges could be brought against former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) chief Dr Anthony Fauci and some of his subordinates who the Committee believed gave misleading testimony. Dr Peter Daszak, the Chief Executive of EcoHealth Alliance, who were the conduit for US funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for the bat coronavirus research the committee believes caused the pandemic, was accused of obstructing the committee’s work. It wants them barred from receiving any future US government funding. Charges against Daszak and Fauci would be popular as there is an appetite for bringing someone to account. The prospect of perjury investigations and criminal charges or government funding bans stirs up waters already muddied by Dr Kadlec himself through his Senate Investigation. It doesn’t matter if aerosolised bioweapons really work or if biodefense spending is necessary,all that our very own Colonel Jack D Ripper wantsis for there to be a widespread belief that human bodily fluids can be polluted by viruses so that the firehose of Manhattan Project for Biodefense funding to his corporate chums continues without interruption. The biodefense mafia are playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. So to anyone wise to the elephant trap, the House sub-committee report which affirms the need to ‘Predict, Prepare, Protect, Prevent’ makes depressing reading. It’s a prescription for more of the same. Wenstrup and his committee believe that pandemics will continue to be recurring events, that Covid-19 was ‘novel’, that it emerged from a Chinese lab and killed millions, that Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute vaccines was a tremendous success which should be repeated in the future and finally that there was a cover-up which involved Chinese and American officials. First of all, at least five years of planning went into bringing us the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or rather the Manhattan Project for Biodefense. It began outside government as a response to the October 2014 US government funding pause on gain-of-function research on SARS and MERS coronaviruses and influenza viruses. Dr Kadlec, the architect of 21stcentury US biodefense policy, was the key driver of this plan. In a2009 interview published in the journalBiosecurity and Bioterrorismhe explained his preoccupation with stopping exotic pandemics, saying: ‘The view I have is deeply rooted in the military, but medical in nature.’ Within a month of the gain-of-function research moratorium which was an existential threat to Kadlec’s threat detection-based rationale for funding gain-of function research and vaccine countermeasure development projects, Kadlec organised a biodefense study breakfast in Washington DC. ByDecember 8 he had set up his Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefensewhose report was the basis for President Trump’s 2018 Biodefense Policy. Kadlec was also chair of the National Academies Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness to Catastrophic Events, organisers of a March 2015 workshop onEnabling Rapid Response and Sustained Capability Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk of Emerging Infectious Diseases. It was chaired by his old friend Dr Richard Hatchett, the Chief Medical Officer at BARDA (the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority). The keynote speaker was Dr Jeremy Farrar, then the newly installed director of the Wellcome Trust. Dr Daszakwas there too, on a panel discussingChallenges and Opportunities in Responding to Coronaviruses; Past and Present. The opportunity to be exploited was that coronaviruses cause the common cold, but could be made to be sound frightening enough that people might take a vaccine if one were to exist. The report published after the workshop records an unnamed person suggesting a ‘Manhattan Project for Biodefense’ was needed. By mid-2015 Farrar drafted the proposal for what was to become the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the vehicle used as a hedge against any future US domestic gain-of-function moratorium and which offshores US government biodefense vaccine projects to commercial partners. CEPI is now led by Dr Hatchett. Dr Barney Graham of the National Institute of Health and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Centre, who had beenresearching the similarities between RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and SARS coronavirus since 2006, proposed the prototype pathogen approach under which research into vaccines for one virus could be rapidly repurposed into vaccines for a similar virus. SARS and MERS vaccine development research in the US went underground and under the radar as RSV vaccine research. Graham’s RSV patent was licensed to developers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 2020. On January 10, 2020, when the genome sequence for the Wuhan coronavirus was released,Dr Vincent Munster, the Chief of the National Institutes of Health’s Virus Ecology Unit,sent Dr Ralph Baric an emailabout the ‘novel’ coronavirus saying, ‘Perfect! Right between your favourite viruses :-)’ It was no surprise: it landed where he put it when he wrote the gain-of-function section of the EcoHealth Alliance’s now-notorious Defuse Proposal which the pandemic sub-committee said had been split up and funded by Fauci after DARPA declined to do so in 2018. Far safer for it to have been civilian rather than military funded. Of course the NIAID knew about the Manhattan Project for Biodefense – it issued Dr Baric with a task order (HHSN272201700036I) on September 15, 2019 to assess the efficacy of candidate coronavirus vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in mouse models. That’s how it happened that Dr Baric was sent the Moderna NIAID jointly-owned mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates on December 16, 2019 before anyone was aware of a Wuhan flu. No one on the sub-committee questioned him about this. Dr Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Response (ASPR) who ran the US response to SARS-CoV-2, activated the US government disaster leadership group on January 3, 2020 (source Paul Mango’s bookOperation Warp Speed), a mere three days after China notified the WHO that it had 17 cases of an unknown pneumonia. No one had died yet. DARPA then notified the research teams participating in their four-year Pandemic Prevention Project which began in February 2018 that the‘novel’ coronavirus was the next test(see last page). And Kadlec saidhis office spent 18 months planning a joint exercisewith the Japanese Ministry of Health on how to repatriate Americans from Japan in the event of a disaster or emergency. It just happened to have been scheduled for March 2020 but was brought forward a month to evacuate theDiamond Princess. How fortuitous, or more likely, how convenient. The Committee report also ignores the important but overlooked reasons why there was such an emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2 virus being ‘novel’. The original SARS first emerged in 2002 during Gro Harlem Brundtland’s tenure as Director General of the World Health Organization.The hyperbolic press releaseclaimed it still threatened the world but had been contained in five months. The Centers for Disease Control held a patent on it. Ten years later, the purportedly deadlier Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia. Between 2013 and 2015 there were ten failed attempts to have the WHO declare a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) over MERS.A conflict of interest declaration for the WHO Emergency Committeesays that researchers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands filed a patent on MERS coronavirus. Intellectual property rights is the first reason the 2020 virus needed to be novel. The second is to avoid the WHO Emergencies Committee declining to issue a PHEIC for an 11th time. Even so, in January 2020 WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had to ask three times before the committee obliged. Wasn’t it lucky that, as Dr Munster pointed out, a novel coronavirus that fell between a bat coronavirus and the SARS virus the CDC held a patent on emerged out of China ‘just in time’ for the mystery virus phase of DARPA’s P3 project, when ‘just in case’ coronavirus vaccines that licensed US government patents were being cooked up?",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/war-on-microbes-the-murky-agenda-behind-the-covid-pandemic/
This methane nonsense is a nasty protection racket,"DAIRY farmer Jamie Blackett was quite right to point out there ismuch nonsense written about flatulent cows and climate change. It’s a great shame he didn’t use hisTelegrapharticle to dispel it. Rather he amplified and tried to justify the nonsense, while gaslighting those who question the need to feed any synthetic enzymes to cows as promulgating ‘febrile conspiracy theories’. I expected better of him. At least he admits that he has skin in the game because he sells his milk to Arla, who announced they are going to ‘trial’, on 30 British dairy farms, feeding the synthetic enzyme inhibitor Bovaer, 3-nitrooxypropanol, to cows to reduce their methane emissions. This is but the latest aspect of the lunacy being imposed on an unwilling people to ‘tackle climate change to save the planet’. Feeding unnecessary chemicals to cows is a monstrous scam justified by the ‘drive to net zero’. It needs to be shouted from the rooftops at every opportunity that the whole wicked business has nothing to do with the climate, cows’ health or the production of milk and meat. It’s part of the greatest grab of wealth in history from the mass of ordinary people to a few stupendously rich internationalist oligarchs, aided by our own government, who aim to control – if they don’t already – the whole world. This methane-curbing nonsense is nothing more than a horribly clever protection racket, based on the fantasy of anthropogenic global warming. How is it a protection racket? Reduced to its essence, it involves farmers being forced to give the stuff to their livestock or else they will suffer the consequences of refusal. The last government (and it is vain to hope this one will be any better) was talking about making it mandatory to give the chemical to all cows by 2030. (What is the magic in 2030? Every repressive measure the state is going to impose on us has a deadline of 2030.) Let’s consider a few facts that might show this racket for what it is. First, there is no evidence that the natural emission of methane from ruminants (or decomposition of vegetation in marshes or burning oil and gas) has the slightest effect on the temperature of the earth. Methane is a trace gas which comprises roughly 0.000193 per cent of the atmosphere – about 1,930 parts perbillion.It breaks down to its constituent parts of carbon and hydrogen over an estimated 7-10 years. The other bogeyman, CO2, without which life would not exist, is about 0.04 per cent or 430 parts per million. It’s interesting to compare the number of cattle in the US in 2024 – 87million – with the number of ruminants that grazed the grasslands of the continent before the white man got going there in the 1800s. The best estimate is that there were 60million bison, 45million antelope, 60million deer and elk, 2million bighorn sheep and a million moose. Roughly speaking, there were twice as many ruminants 250 years ago as there are cattle today. One wonders what happened to all that methane they must have created over centuries, while at the same time their grazing and dung made the plains of the Midwest some of the deepest and most fertile soils in the world. It is proposed, at least to start with, that only dairy cows in ‘zero grazing’ indoor systems are to be given this synthetic substance, because all their feed is brought to them rationed. Apparently cows that go out to pasture will not be given it – yet – because it has to be fed regularly, in measured amounts. According to DEFRA’s figures for June 2024 there were just under 5million cattle in England, of which 1.1million were dairy cows (down by about 30 per cent in 30 years). It is not clear what proportion of these was kept indoors all year round, but it is estimated that fewer than 20 per cent of dairy cows are housed permanently. The makers of this substance, a Swiss company, dsm-firmenich (they’re so woke they’ve dispensed with capital letters) claim that feeding 1⁄4 teaspoon a day to each cow will reduce its methane emissions by 30 per cent. (Apparently the US sellers of the stuff, Elanco, recommend a tablespoon a day.) So let’s assume there are roughly 200,000 cows kept inside, in Britain, all year round and they’re all fed Bovaer; methane emissions from the national herd will be reduced by 30 per cent of 4 per cent of the national herd – that is by 1.2 per cent. It’s hard to find out exactly what this chemical will cost, but it’s somewhere between £50 and £100 per cow per year. The makers claim the cost will be reduced by half in 2025 when a new manufacturing plant in Scotland starts making the chemical. If there is no financial benefit from increased milk yield or health of the cows and there are concerns over the testing and safety of the substance, why would a farmer bother with it? And how would it be paid for? Not by selling dairy produce. Rather, farmers will become part of the ‘self-sustaining carbon inset market’. In other words, they will be sucked into a fantasy world trading in ‘carbon credits’. The amount of CO2e – a new catch-all formula for all ‘greenhouse gas emissions’ which includes methane, carbon dioxide and anything else considered to contribute to ‘global warming’ – not produced by the cows will be calculated by a third-party ‘expert’. The expert can’t measure the amount of gasnotproduced, but will verify the amount of Bovaer being fed, from which the amount of gas not being produced can be estimated and expressed in metric tonnes. This will be sold, through a company operating a ‘carbon insetting marketplace’, to big corporations to allow them to carry on as before. The money (less commission) will be paid to the farmer who has caused his cows not to produce whatever weight of gas the third-party expert certifies they aren’t producing. The rest of the cost of feeding Bovaer is expected to come from state subsidies to the farmer. Why is the government encouraging – even mandating – the feeding of this chemical to the national herd? Ah, well, apart from the endless profits for the pharmaceutical company that will undoubtedly burgeon down the years, our government has signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement and it needs every little help it can get – even making up some fanciful reduction in ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions to bring the UK closer to ‘net zero’ by 2050. Even if we accept the warmists’ claim that we have to mess about with the digestion of the world’s cows, what’s the point when saving the planet means that much of what makes life worth living will be destroyed to avoid something that might happen a century from now? It makes no sense to anyone capable of thinking. Blackett is wrong to say thateveryonewants farmers to feed this chemical to their cows to reduce their flatulence. Increasing numbers of people are waking up to the whole climate scam; the wind is changing, and judging by the public’s reaction to Arla’s announcement, causing sales of their products, particularly Lurpak and Anchor butter, to plummet, farmers would be well advised to resist this enforced medication of their cows.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-methane-nonsense-is-a-nasty-protection-racket/
Why NHS staff are shunning the vaccines,"NHS staff are boycotting covid and flu vaccinations while the government is busy promoting them to the public in a television and radio campaign. Concerned by the low uptake in the health service, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has appealed to healthcare practitioners to get jabbed. This season, only 14 per cent of NHS workers took covid jabs and only a quarter received flu vaccines. TheNHS saythis is because hospital staff are busy and have no time. Official figures tell a different story as NHS staff are taking double the days off sick post-covid vaccine rollout than they have since 2009. Unusually, in 2020, absences rocketed in the summer months; absence is traditionally low between May and November. Covid vaccines were offered to front-line staff from December 2020, a sharp rise in absences began in March 2021, three months into the rollout, when seasonal illness is traditionally waning. Sick days have doubled from the baseline of 3.75 per cent to 6.75 per cent, the highest since 2009, and have not dropped back to 2019 numbers which were between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent. Even during peak pandemic months, absences ranged between 4.75 per cent in February 2020 to 6.10 per cent in May 2020. One NHS doctor, who did not want to be named, said adverse reactions in staff and patients are contributing to ‘vaccine hesitance’. She said: ‘We have all noticed the adverse effects in our patients. Many of us have become vaccine hesitant after seeing the debilitating health issues our patients are now dealing with, and those we are dealing with ourselves. No health professional that I have spoken to wants any more boosters. ‘The type of reactions we see range from local allergic reactions to a whole switch-on of histamine systems, such as POTS and MCAS.’ Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), characterised by dizziness, is a blood circulation disorder which causes an abnormal increase in heart rate when standing up, while mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) causes allergy symptoms in multiple systems. Officially, the government recommends thecovid jabto care-home residents, all adults 65 and over, babies from six months and adults up to 64 in clinical risk groups.Fluvaccination is recommended to all ages including babies from six months. The ads fail to define these cohorts and feature the elderly, pregnant women, men, and children under 12 despite official figures showing that covid and flu pose minimal risks to them. Deaths are likely to occur in children and teenagers only if they have co-morbidities. The graph below is from the officialGreen Book, which provides the latest vaccination information to healthcare staff, and shows there have been just nine covid deaths in the six-month-to-19-year-old age ranges, and deaths only escalate in the over-60s. Every death is a tragedy, but a death caused by vaccinating a healthy individual is doubly so. Our drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says 90 per cent of adverse reactions go unreported, but even so, is busy recording stark, serious adverse event (SAE) figures. By the beginning of June this year, healthcare professionals and the public had reported nearly 3,000 deaths (2,707) related to covid vaccination since December 2020. Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and unknown brands of mono and bivalent covid vaccines have been available in the UK. MHRA summaries are culled from Yellow Card reports, last issued in the week ending June 2, 2024. Overall, 1 in 111 people injected experienced a Yellow Card adverse event (assuming one person submits only one report) while 1 in 148 people injected experienced an adverse event classified as serious; 1 in 180 reports were associated with a fatality. Over 1.5million adverse events had been reported (1,586,411) by then, involving half a million people (486,634); 75 per cent of reactions were considered serious. The MHRA defines serious as ‘life-threatening, prolonged hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or congenital abnormality or birth defect’. Although the AstraZeneca vaccine has been unavailable since August 2022, it accounts for the highest number of total reactions at 885,374, compared with Pfizer’s mono and bivalent jabs, 533,038. By now, most people have come into contact with covid. Those who contracted it enjoy natural immunity although the Green Book tells doctors that natural immunity wanes after one year. That is still double the immunity offered by vaccines which wanes aftersix months. In September 2020, nine months into the covid pandemic and before a vaccine was available, Oxford University issued apress releasestating that ‘researchers found that natural infections with covid-19 produced a robust T cell response, including inducing T cell memory to potentially fight future infections’. Basically, this means that T cells help the immune system protect the body from serious infection, which is what healthcare experts claim vaccines do. Oxford’s results were published in the journalNature Immunology. GPs boast a slightly higher uptake of both jabs than other healthcare professionals, but still only 23.6 per cent for covid and 42 per cent for flu, the highest uptake being in the South West of England. Doctors’ surgeries in England were confused as the Green Book omitted GPs and frontline staff as being eligible for autumn covid boosters. The confusion stemmed from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s (JCVI) decision not to continue to recommend covid vaccination for front-line health and care staff in favour of ‘local occupational health solutions’ – or managing the risk. Officialstatisticsdo not support panic and expensive, multi-million-pound ad campaigns paid for by the taxpayer. The national flu and covid-19 surveillance report for week 48, November 28, said that although ‘influenza activity increased’ it had reached only ‘low activity levels’. Covid was at ‘baseline levels’ , and remained stable, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was at ‘medium’ levels with increases in most age groups. RSV was practically unheard of until a vaccine was produced this year. England’s Chief Medical Officer SirChris Whittyis urging people to get their flu vaccines despite the fact that infections halved between 2022/23 and 2023/24, with no indication they will be worse in 2024/25. Meanwhile, the respected independent, non-profit organisation the Cochrane Collaboration, who analyse clinical trials for healthcare interventions, found influenza vaccination offered little benefit. There are more than 200 viruses that can cause influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Symptoms include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches and pains, cough and runny nose. Doctors cannot distinguish between influenza and ILI without laboratory tests because both last for only a few days and rarely cause serious illness or death. Cochrane’s stabilised review of 20 years’ worth of papers (stabilised meaning there is no new evidence to contradict findings) discovered that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is oversold to all age groups and that only 2 per cent of adults get flu. Dr Tom Jefferson, lead author of the Cochrane review and Associate Tutor at Oxford University, said: ‘Influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science. We have few trials, and masses of very poor-quality observational evidence.’ After analysing 25studies conducted over a single influenza season in North America, South America and Europe, between 1969 and 2009, it found the vaccine reduced the chance of getting laboratory-confirmed influenza from 23 cases out of 1,000 (2.3 per cent) to nine cases out of 1,000 (0.9 per cent) in healthy adults. Around one per cent of people who contract covid die with it. Most who die have co-morbidities.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:21:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-nhs-staff-are-shunning-the-vaccines/
Why report the mass rape of white schoolgirls when you can pick on Gregg Wallace?,"WELL done to the insurgent group led by Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, a former al-Qaeda commander, who not only ended Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule over Syria but also finally removed Gregg Wallace from the front pages. Although I suspect Wallace is still generating quite a few think/opinion pieces. If you hadn’t heard of Gregg Wallace before, a greengrocer made good and a judge on the BBC’s MasterChef, you certainly will have after last week. It was revealed by our media and ‘middle-class women of a certain age’ that Wallace was allegedly a bit of a sex pest on the set. Now, I have no time for such behaviour, I am not defending it and social conservatives have no business defending it either. This is stating the obvious, which I didhere. So, one more time; women deserve to be treated with decency, respect and professionalism at work (or indeed at home). Having stated this obvious fact it is now time to state another obvious fact, namely that the media coverage about this minor workplace issue has been totally and utterly disproportionate to the wrong committed. That a story which in most workplaces would be dealt with by the ladies in Human Resources should generate the headlines it did, and in particular the ‘think pieces’, tells us once again a universal truth about Britain: some victims count, and some victims don’t.And what is glaringly obvious here is that if you are a middle-class woman of a certain age working in the media you count; if you are a white working-class teenage girl in Rotherham or Oxford you do not. You are seen as trash by the police and sacrificial victims on the altar of Diversity is our Strength by the political establishment. Therefore should you have your entire childhood stolen and your adulthood ruined because you are brutally and repeatedly raped and dehumanised by gangs of Asian/Muslim grooming men, so be it. If you are a middle-class media woman of a certain age and you are sexually harassed on the set of MasterChef, it is literally, quite literally, hold the front page. Polly Vernon was giventwo entire pagesto tell us all how she was harassed over the years at work (the stealth boast). I don’t remember a single girl of the thousands who were brutalised in English towns being given this much space to tell us their stories. And don’t bother dismissing this as ‘what-aboutery’. What about, what aboutery? What-aboutery – very much like the lectern issue I talked about before – tells you all you need to know about the media’s priorities. Not every story can make the front page or even page 10. The stories that do make the paper and the broadcast media are seen by our media to be more important than those that don’t. I am not being conspiratorial; I have no time for such nonsense. It is a straightforward matter of priorities. We all have priorities. My children are my priority, my neighbour’s children, although very nice, are not. Middle-class media women are a priority; raped and abused working-class girls are not. It’s that simple. The other reason Gregg Wallace dominated the front pages is because he is the perfect villain: a white working-class geezer done good. So the media will go after him. But if you are an Asian man who treats white working-class girls as trash, something to be raped, passed around to other Asian men, urinated on and kept in a cage, you are rarely exposed as the child rapist and child trafficker that you are. This would jeopardise the sacred mantra of Diversity is our Strength. So it gets buried for decades until it becomes so obvious that someone somewhere has to say stop. TCW has spoken about the Rotherham scandal before. I did sohereandhereandhere. Indeed, even when cases came to trial, the abuse of these girls continued: ‘When cases did eventually reach court, GMP left the young victims to be harassed and intimidated by the men who had previously abused them, sometimes at gunpoint.’ Also, police took no action in the case of a 15-year-old who gave birth to a child of her ‘pimp’. Amazingly I don’t remember many headlines about raped girls being threatened at gunpoint by their abusers when their criminal cases eventually came to court. I am sure there is some white working-class man doing something inappropriate at work somewhere which deserves much more attention. Another example of the abuse that went on was: ‘One child told GMP that her abusers kept girls in cages and “made them bark like a dog or dress like a baby” but took no action once she left Greater Manchester and was put in care elsewhere.’ Lovely. The latest case that involved the brutal abuse of white girls by mostly Asian men came during the American Presidential election, so some lack of coverage was to be expected, but I don’t recall any serious coverage at all. Like so many other cases,it sank like a stone. A West Yorkshire Police press release said: ‘Two men have been convicted and jailed for sexually abusing young girls in Calderdale, bringing the total to 22. Legal restrictions and appeals against convictions meant we were unable to share the outcomes until today. The convictions follow an investigation launched in 2016 following reports of repeated sexual abuse of a vulnerable young girl between 2002 and 2006, starting when she was 13 years old.’ Two days earlier a press statement said: ‘Twenty men have been jailed for more than 219 years combined after being found guilty of raping and abusing young girls. Through a series of individual investigations and trials, the men were found to have sexually abused and exploited four girls between the ages of 12 and 16 in Calderdale.’ I put ‘Calderdale’ into the Times search engine, and found that they reported the casehere. In fairness to the Times, they have been better at covering this scandal than others but if you put ‘Gregg Wallace’ into their search engine those results go on for pages and pages. It’s ridiculous.The Times said juries had heard details of ‘absolutely shocking offending’, in which victims were treated as ‘defenceless commodities to be abused and traded at whim’. Detective Chief Inspector Oliver Coates of West Yorkshire police, said the men had committed ‘appalling sexual abuse on a scale which can barely be believed’. We should ask ourselves why this abuse could barely be believed. Because the media and some police officers (not necessarily this one) turned a blind eye to such abuse for decades. Nothing was permitted to challenge the sacred belief that Diversity is our Strength or Immigration Built Britain. That’s why you hardly ever get a mugshot of Malik Quadeer, 67, who was found guilty of five counts of rape and jailed for 22 years, or Shahzad Nowaz, 45, who was found guilty of rape and making threats to kill and sentenced to 11 years, on the front page. It is much easier to slap Gregg Wallace on there for making ‘inappropriate comments’.There we have it: some issues deserve the lectern treatment (Far Right Thuggery), and some issues don’t (rape of thousands of girls in towns mainly in the north of England). Some victims count (middle-class women of a certain age who work in the media), and some victims don’t (white working-class girls in Rotherham). The disgustingly disproportionate media focus on the alleged wrongdoing of Gregg Wallace, compared with the confirmed and brutal criminality of, say, Shahzad Nowaz of Halifax, tells us yet again how the mainstream media operate, namely in a ruthless and immoral fashion always designed to protect the Big Lie, that there are no downsides to mass immigration. The girls of Rotherham and Oxford would beg to differ.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-report-the-mass-rape-of-white-schoolgirls-when-you-can-pick-on-gregg-wallace/
"Debunked – the great Diversity, Equity and Inclusion myth","MOST thinking people come to realise that positive discrimination doesn’t work. As a twenty-something idealist I was much impressed by President Lyndon Johnson’s Project Headstart educational programme which began with the earliest years of ‘deprived’ children’s lives. Twenty years later,when I looked up the research againI found most of the programme’s advantages had been wiped out by age 11 and virtually all by 20. It was a complete waste of time and money. It certainly had little chance of compensating for a dramatic culture shift towards fatherlessness, particularly amongst blacks, from the 1960s onwards. (By 1988 60 per cent of black children were born to unmarried mothers compared with just 33 per cent in 1960.) Louise Casey’s (‘services’-based) interventions worked no better here. But the problem with socialist thinking is that when one intervention doesn’t work they think they need more. When that doesn’t work they take it as evidence of deep ‘structural’ or internalised discrimination that can only be ‘made up for’ by quotas. So they give up on educational standards and instead simply select and promote on identity characteristics. That is where we are at. Today ensuring full diversity, equality and inclusion is the top goal of education, the judiciary, banks and business. Forget profit or efficiency. The NHS is but one example where DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) trumps its prior (or what should be its prior) purpose, patient care. Lazy people will still think DEI policies mean well and therefore at least must be a good thing for a decent, fairer, kinder society and happier people in general. Well no, not even that. Dr Colin Wright, an evolutionary biology PhD and Manhattan Institute Fellow and the CEO/Editor-in-Chief ofReality’s Last Stand, has blown a hole through this final myth too. ‘In a stunning series of events,’ hereports in his latest substack, ‘two leading media organisations – theNew York Timesand Bloomberg – abruptly shelved their coverage of agroundbreaking studythat raises serious concerns about the psychological impacts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) pedagogy.’ In the unreported studies, ‘Through carefully controlled experiments, the researchers demonstrated that exposure to anti-oppressive (i.e. anti-racist) rhetoric – common in many DEI initiatives – consistently amplified perceptions of bias where none existed. Participants were more likely to see prejudice in neutral scenarios and to support punitive actions against imagined offenders.’ These effects were not marginal: ‘Hostility and punitive tendencies increased by double-digit percentages across multiple measures (and) perhaps most troubling, the study revealed a chilling convergence with authoritarian attitudes, suggesting that such training is fostering not empathy, but coercion and control.’ Thestudy, conducted by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) in collaboration with Rutgers University, found that ‘certain DEI practices could induce hostility, increase authoritarian tendencies, and foster agreement with extreme rhetoric’. Given the billions of dollars invested annually in such initiatives, Wright argues that ‘the public has a right to know if such programs – heralded as effective moral solutions to bigotry and hate – might instead be fueling the very problems they claim to solve’. The implications of these findings cannot be downplayed, he argues: ‘DEI programs have become a fixture in workplaces, schools, and universities across the United States, with a 2023 Pew Research Centerreportindicating that more than half of US workers have attended some form of DEI training. Institutions collectively spend approximately$8billionannually on these initiatives, yet the NCRI study underscores how little scrutiny they receive. While proponents of DEI argue that these programs are essential to achieving equity and dismantling systemic oppression, the NCRI’s data suggests that such efforts may actually be deepening divisions and cultivating hostility.’ We have exactly the same problem here in the UK with programmes which are equally divisive and politically motivated but can be counterproductive –all paid for by us. An estimate based onFreedom of Information requests to 6,000 public authorities cites the existence of approximately 10,000 public DEI jobs at a cost of £557million a year to the UK taxpayer. Why would we be paying that money to make people more resentful and more likely to bully?

"Marvel at Trump's resurgent America, weep for Starmer's desolate Britain","WE are about to witness a unique political experiment. We have two English-speaking countries which have just held elections and now both are about to implement completely opposing sets of policies. We’ll be able to see which of these two countries has the right policies for the wellbeing of its citizens and which is driving its citizens into a dystopian hell of impoverishment, political oppression and unstoppable decline. OK, not much suspense there. I imagine you all know the answer. But let’s still take a moment to compare the political decisions of the US and UK. Here a few of the key policy areas: Climate change Energy Immigration Taxation and public spending Free speech Health These are just a few of the main differences between Trump’s America and Starmer’s Britain which I can quickly think of. No doubt there will be many others I haven’t mentioned. But perhaps the greatest tragedy is that, due to the Labour Party’s oft-expressed loathing for Trump, Starmer will work to alienate Trump’s revived and successful America, giving him an excuse to take Britain closer to the failing, over-regulated, high-energy-cost, free-speech-suppressing European Union.

"Exit June Raine, pursued by bare-faced lies","DR JUNE Raine, the career drug safety expert who has headed the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the last fiveyears, is stepping down. She’s led a regulatory revolution which has, she proudly says, turned the agency from a watchdog into an enabler. There’s no news yet on what she’s doing next: perhaps a pharma sinecure awaits as a reward. So long, Dame June. You won’t be missed. You’ve been a disaster. Your legacy is the still unfolding calamity of the mRNA gene therapies that masquerade as vaccines. When the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA ‘medical countermeasure’ was authorised on December 2, 2020, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following closely behind, you shamelessly told the public ‘Your safety comes first’. Tell that to the families of Lisa Shaw, Dr Stephen Wright or the 75 others whose death certificates officially state the covid vaccines caused their deaths. All-cause excess death figures have risen since the covid vaccine roll out suggesting the real death toll due to these gene-therapy vaccines’ unknown long-term effects is much higher. In an unfortunate oversight, the announcement of the MHRA’s authorisation for use of the Pfizer/BioNTech product was made on the 59thanniversary of thewithdrawal from the UK market of thalidomide by its UK distributors. Thalidomide’s history as the very first landmark drug safety event was well known to you, Dame June. Prescribed under the brand name Distaval for morning sickness and, oh the irony, to treat pneumonia and flu, it was tested in animals but not in humans before being placed on the market. It was advertised saying ‘Distaval can be given completely safely to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child’. Five years and 10,000 babies later, 2,000 of whom were born in the UK, everyone could see from the catastrophic birth defects this wasn’t true. Dr Frances Kelsey of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)saved Americans from the thalidomide disaster. Kelsey repeatedly asked for more safety data when 60 days was the norm for drugs to be authorised for use. The MHRA’s slogan is ‘putting patients first’ which on your watch was interpreted to mean speeding up the time it takes to review marketing applications so that drugs reach patients faster. You, Dame June, are no Frances Kelsey. Dame Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, lavished praise on you at a2022 Medics Day event at Somerville, your old Oxford College, saying: ‘The reason why the UK was the first to approve the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is because of June and the way she led the regulatory body here in the UK in a way that has never been led in any regulatory body anywhere in the world. And that is a phenomenal achievement.’ You proudly expanded, saying: ‘We tore up the rule book and we allowed [covid vaccine] companies to immediately start overlapping trials and large-scale manufacture being prepared at risk. We did not know if any would be effective . . . But you can see the layers of parallel working that went on. That can never be turned back now.’ Safety surveillance wasn’t an afterthought. The MHRA was planning for it even before the Phase 3 trials were under way. ‘We began in the middle of June – six months ahead of time – 2020, to start to prepare what safety surveillance we would need,’ said Raine. ‘Kate [Bingham] at that point had thought that once the purchase had been made, the approval had been signed, “home and dry” and what I was able to share with you [Kate] was we only really learn about benefit-risk in clinical use and we knew that there would be a vast influx of reports of side effects. No effective medicine or vaccine is without them.’ The inversion of benefit-risk was no slip of the tongue. The MHRA, our most Orwellian of government agencies, acts as a ‘pro-innovation’ industry enabler which in practice means the risks of rapidly assessed medicinal products or the new ‘platforms’ such as mRNA falls entirely on patients while the benefits accrue disproportionately to pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders as revenues and profits. It is apparent now that launching the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) pandemic prevention mRNA countermeasure platform was the singular objective of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. At the very first meeting of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)to discuss Covid-19 vaccines on May 7, 2020, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the Department of Health Deputy Chief Medical Officer, told members that ‘a vaccine was of paramount importance’. The next minute he helpfully told them there was the potential for RNA vaccine manufacture to provide a million doses in a single batch. At that juncture, Moderna and BioNTech combined and over the course of a decade, had injected a thousand or so trial volunteers with their mRNA products. All of BioNTech’s pre-2020 trial volunteers were cancer patients which inherently limits the availability of long-term safety data. Nonetheless the scale-up potential was tremendous even for an infectious disease such as Covid-19 which Public Health England downgraded from a ‘high consequence infectious disease’ on March 19, 2020, two days before Boris Johnson ordered the first national lockdown after Dominic Cummings and his Red Teampushed the panic button. Those same JCVI minutes state that the MHRA would ‘help manage any concerns about vaccine safety’. It has certainly done that. The UK public were told that ‘no corners have been cut whatsoever’ in its authorisation of BNT162b2, which they were reassured had been tested in more than 40,000 people. What they weren’t told by the MHRA was that to manufacture a million doses in a single batch, the manufacturing process was changed and although the upscale product was injected into a token sample of volunteers, the MHRA never saw any of the data. A planned cross-over safety study wasn’t due to be published until February 2021 but was never done and as none of the data from volunteers dosed with Process 2 product was available on November 14, 2020, the data cut-off date for the final analysis, it was simply left out. The MHRA made its authorisation decision based on data for a similar product tested in the trial, but had no insight into the actual product which it authorised on a comparability basis, meaning it permitted the use of a product untested in humans in any meaningful way. To produce a million doses a batch, genetically modified E-coli bacteria are used to produce the RNA by fermentation. It introduces another safety problem, a dirty little secret. E-coli also produces endotoxin, which is more dangerous than sarin gas. Itkills around 950,000 people a year globally, often making the news in the United States where there are alarmingly frequent recalls of hamburger meat due to E-coli contamination,including a major one on November 21, 2024. InJuly 2021 the MHRA hired Dr Alison Cave as its Chief Safety Officer. Biochemist Dr Geoff Pain, who is foremost in warning about the endotoxin-linked harms of mRNA vaccines,points out that Dr Cave has significant expertise in endotoxin-induced myocarditis. This is the known ‘rare’ safety concern the MHRA is managing but it’s not the only one. In 2022, possibly prompted by Dr Cave, the MHRA decided that the 549,357 Yellow Card reports on covid vaccines were skewing the ‘disproportionality’ statistical analysis it uses to detect safety signals.A report was made to the Commission on Human Medicinesabout this decision which retired Ministry of Defence safety expert Nick Huntobtained after a protracted battle with the Information Commissioner’s Office. The nine-page report contained three redactions – the name and email address of the assessor and a single digit on a table of outlier safety signals. The redacted number was for ‘necrotic lymphadenopathy’ reports relating to Tozinameran, which is the name of the mRNA active substance in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It can be caused by endotoxin and is a cancer-linked safety-signal. Endotoxin (also referred to as lipopolysaccharide or LPS) has long been known to act as an adjuvant, leading Dr Pain and others to question whether its presence in both the BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines is intentional. TheJCVI Covid-19 sub-committee minutes for November 30, 2020end with the committee asking the question whether lymphadenopathy is an mRNA-associated event. In December 2020, the World Health Organization Sage committeereporton the Pfizer/BioNTech covid vaccine, listed lymphadenopathy as a potential adverse event of special interest as some clinical trial participants dosed with the Process 1 version had ongoing lymphadenopathy. When the booster trial results were published in 2021 there was a 13-fold increase in lymphadenopathy incidence (0.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent) between the original trial of Process 1 product and the booster trial in which volunteers were dosed with the Process 2 upscale product. The MHRA said it was a cumulative effect caused by the third dose while ignoring the issue of the product switch. It also ignored the real-world evidence in the Yellow Card data base that confirmed the lymphadenopathy problem and which Dr Raine told her Somerville audience was the only way benefit-risk could truly be assessed. In days to come, your name, June Raine, will inextricably be linked with mRNA as Frances Kelsey’s is with thalidomide. History records Kelsey as a heroine. It won’t be so kind to you. May you live out your days in ignominy.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-06T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/exit-june-raine-pursued-by-bare-faced-lies/
"From 1991, a prescient warning about the globalist agenda","AS A student of International Relations in the early 1970s I had no idea of the depths of my ignorance. The motto of myalma mater, the London School of Economics, is ‘rerum cognoscere causas’, an abbreviation of Virgil’s phrase ‘Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas’,meaning‘Fortunate, who was able to know the causes of things’, or as Dryden interpreted it in his study of Virgil, ‘Happy the Man who, studying Nature’s Laws, Thro’ known Effects can trace the secret Cause.’ I was ignorant and unhappy because I could not ‘trace the secret cause’. Recent events and the ocean of information now freely available have given me a greater understanding of the reasons for the growing dystopia. A significant source has been John Coleman’s book,The Conspirators’ Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300. Coleman’s research, published in November 1991, led him to believe that a small number of powerful individuals are acting through various agencies to implement their goals to consolidate their power and wealth. The culprits he exposed are mostly familiar: the United Nations, the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, the Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tavistock Institute, Starmer’s Trilateral Commission, Lammy’s Bilderberg Group, Freemasons, Bolsheviks, and other messianic, eugenicist people and organisations to which we can add theKissinger/Schwab atrocity, the World Economic Forum. Coleman included the following amongst the goals of the conspirators. Many of them have been successful whilst others have morphed and been moulded by circumstance. ‘A New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their control.’ ‘The utter destruction of national identity and national pride.’ ‘The destruction of religion and more, especially the Christian religion.’ As promoted by Justin Welby and Jorge Mario Bergoglio. ‘The control of every individual through means of mind control.’ International media is controlled by only five or six corporations. The CIA and British intelligence agencies have a long history of news manipulation. ‘Legalisation of drugs and pornography.’ The proliferation of porn sites on the internet has accompanied the legalisation of various dangerous drugs in the US and elsewhere. ‘Limited wars in the advanced countries [to cause] the deaths of 3billion people.’ Coleman added that ‘some of the more important members of the Committee of 300 are also members of Nato’. ‘To introduce new cults.’ Coleman wrote that the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and others were constructs of the Tavistock Instituteof Human Relations. In his bookWeird Scenes inside the Canyon,David McGowan describes similar initiatives by the US government to manipulate the youth. The latest incarnation of this cultism is Taylor Swift mania. ‘The population of the United States to be reduced by 100million by the year 2050.’ As abortions are encouraged at increasingly late stages and death pods await the infirm and depressed, theLancetdeclares that‘by 2050, over three-quarters (155 of 204) of countries will not have high enough fertility rates to sustain population size over time; this will increase to 97 per cent of countries (198 of 204) by 2100’. ‘To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another.’ Aids, Financial Crisis, Covid-19, Ukraine, Middle East, Mass Immigration, Disease X . . . ‘To give the fullest support to supra-national organisations such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.’ The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all UN member states in 2015 provides an excuse for their totalitarian ambitions. ‘Penetrate and subvert all governments.’ As we wait, more in hope than expectation, that Donald Trump will reveal the full Wexner/Epstein story, it is likely that many have been compromised elsewhere such as at Yale’s Skull and Bones Society, the Bohemian Grove meetings, the Sean Combs parties, the Franklin Scandal, etc, etc. ‘Take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of completely destroying it.’ Donald Trump has promised to dismantle the Department of Education believing that for the past 45 years it has been ‘indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial sexual and political material’. Romans 8:25-27 tells us that ‘it is plain to anyone with eyes to see that at the present time all created life groans in a sort of universal travail.’ In considering Sir Keir Starmer’s recent meetings with both BlackRock and Gates it is also plain to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear that the conspirators are emboldened and keen to flaunt their control. While we can hope that the change of the guard in the White House will confound the knavish tricks of the conspirators, Coleman also warns: ‘Any strong leader who suddenly appears to rescue the nation must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.’",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/from-1991-a-prescient-warning-about-the-globalist-agenda/
"Beware, Sir Keir, this petition is the tip of the iceberg","TCW readers will be aware of the petition on the UK Government and Parliament website calling for another general election. Some will have been amused and many may have signed it as a protest statement or as therapy. At 6pm last evening, the petition had attracted 2,973,970 signatures and by the time Parliament debates it on January 6 – appropriately enough the Feast of the Epiphany – the odds are that the tally will have exceeded 3million and be heading inexorably towards the next milestone (on which topic more below). It’s truly amazing how many horrors the Starmer administration has managed to spawn in less than half a year. One of the earliest was the revival of a high-ranking position which has had no incumbent since the early fourteenth century. After the post had been vacant for hundreds of years it was a surprise to see Lord Alli take up the mantle of Keeper of the Wardrobe. This fount of unsolicited generosity not only ensured that the Prime Minister was bespectacled and bedizened as befits a world leader, but the Keeper’s largesse provided bountifully for Lady Starmer and much of the new Front Bench as well. It’s not the money involved here that matters so much. It’s the sense that for the anointed there can be nothing wrong in accepting free gear costing thousands of pounds that leaves voters with the sense that these people wouldn’t recognise their own venality unless it grew horns and stared back at them from their mirror. The objective here is not to draw up a ledger of the missteps and wrongdoings of this ill-starred administration because it has already run out of steam and the chickens will soon come home to roost. For instance, what will Bridget Phillipson’s imposition of VAT on private school fees do other than harm children and schools in both state and private education? Even the progressive Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) reckons that the net revenue raised will be trivial when allowing for the extra funding needed in the state sector to accommodate the influx of formerly privately educated children. What’s the point of this other than pure spite? What will be the overall devastation wreaked upon the British economy by quondam (until rumbled) economist Rachel Reeves? The wealthy are leaving the country, businesses are battening down the hatches and wages and employment opportunities are contracting sharply. The unspoken guiding principle in both cases is that the public sector should be rewarded with pay rises while the private sector is punished, plucked and bullied. Whenever, as now, Sir Keir Starmer senses that his reputation needs burnishing he issues a fresh set of policy statements, targets and roadmaps designed to give an impression that as he wallows about in a mess of his own creation his focus is firmly fixed on the business of government and the sunny uplands that somehow await. Credit is due to the team atGuido Fawkeswho produced a diagramlast week showing how the wooden slogans of Starmer-speak succeed one another in cascades of vacuity. The mish-mash of three foundations, five missions, six first steps, six milestones and seven pillars were never meant to be taken seriously. Neither are they even aspirational. These are the kinds of things that an idealistic sixth-former might mock up on a whiteboard with no thought to the practicalities of implementation. But one current milestone is interesting and it’s not one of Keir Starmer’s. It’s the one of the ‘Call a General Election’ petition nearing the three million mark. Clearly the petition could have no practical effect but its message should have given the government pause for thought. Elected with a huge majority not on the basis of a popular prospectus but to punish the Tories for 14 years of stasis and broken promises, Labour might have begun its period in government cautiously and with some humility in order to work towards consent if not consensus. But no: such promises as were made in the run-up to July’s election have been trashed and other policies such as the abolition of the winter fuel allowance for many pensioners came out of nowhere. Moreover thegovernment’s response to the petitionposted on December 6 is far from conciliatory and more than anything expresses annoyance at the presumption of the troublesome signatories. The language is predictably wooden with three mentions of ‘foundations’ in the first three paragraphs. The petulant tone is accompanied by clumsy inclusivity language as in ‘The Prime Minister can call a general election at a time of their choosing’. The Deputy Prime Minister was interviewed by Trevor Phillips on Sunday television, arguing simultaneously that many more affordable houses were needed for ‘working people’ but that there was already an abundance of housing available for immigrants. Is Angela Rayner making up policy on the hoof? Airbnb renters beware! There’s only so much of this kind of thing that people will take before their dissatisfaction finds forms of expression and at a scale that are less easily ignored than a petition.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:16:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/beware-sir-keir-beware-this-petition-is-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/
The BlackRock connection and a nightmare for farmers,"THE current intriguing question is what could the US multinational investment behemoth BlackRock (‘BRK’) possibly have in common with a left-wing British elected government? Founded in 1988, BRK, with assets in excess of $11.5trillion, is active in enterprise risk management, a fixed-income institutional asset manager which has frequently been heavily censured for supporting extraction of fossil fuels, the international arms trade and a slew of human rights abuses. According toThe Canary last month:‘Just days ago, climate groups Friends of the Earth US and Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) submitted a complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Their complaint alleges that BlackRock have been directly contributing to environmental and human rights abuses around the world through its investments in agribusiness. ‘The complaint lays out how BlackRock has invested in companies that are destroying rainforests, and with them eradicating sorely needed biodiversity. The asset management company are also accused of human rights abuses in what Friends of the Earth call “an epidemic of violence”.’ Why, we would have to wonder, should such an amoral capitalist adventurer be welcomed so gushingly into the very heart of Downing Street? ‘I’m determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets,’ thePrime Minister wrote on November 21.‘This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalise on the UK’s position as a world leading hub for investment.’ This, apparently, is nothing new. Ethan Stone ofopenDemocracy wrote:‘On 21 November in Downing Street, senior executives from BlackRock, one of the world’s most controversial companies, sat down opposite Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. The government’s laser-focus on private investment as the key means of driving economic growth has inevitably led to a reliance on the world’s big money machines, like BlackRock.’What price socialism? St Jeremy the Unlamented of Islington would surely disapprove.This is a relationship that Labour developed in opposition and which has become even cosier since the party entered government, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink making a star turn at Labour’s investment summit last month and posing for pictures with the PM when Starmer visited New York in September. Senior BlackRock figures were there, too, when No 10 held a summer reception for business leaders. Should we be worried? Yes. We should be very worried indeed.With their most recent Budget, Labour have raised a chorus of anger and alarm from the farming community. They have proposed that from April 2026, inheritance tax (IHT) relief for business and agricultural assets will be capped at £1million, a new reduced rate of 20 per cent being charged above that (rather than the standard 40 per cent rate). Tax due can be paid by interest-free annual instalments spread over ten years. Now, what might this have to do with BRK? According toDaniel Priestley of Dent Global who tweeted on November 22, possibly quite a lot. Watch out British Farmers, This is how@Keir_Starmer's new best buddies at BlackRock are going to screw you over in 7 steps ...1. They will start buying up small plots of agricultural land at double the normal price. They will issue a directive to all of their energy... While it must be said this is wholly speculative, the idea alone should send shivers not just down farmers’ spines but every one of us. At the outset BRK will unobtrusively begin scooping up parcels of farming land but paying way above the odds. In concert, they’ll direct all their energy companies to secure land for carbon capture. Their cohorts will appear to bid against each other thus pushing the cost of land up to levels no farmer, needing a return on investment, can hope to compete with. For some sellers this must seem like a welcome boom. It’s not.A net effect will be to push agricultural land values to new and wholly false levels. So, when a farmer dies and his estate is assessed for IHT, the asset will suddenly, in HMRC terms, be worth far more than before. The heirs will have no viable means of paying the tax: ‘In swoops a BlackRock subsidiary with a “Agri Debt Finance Tax Relief” product to lend them 20 per cent of the “value” of their farm so they can pay the taxes’.No free lunches here. Any borrowing will come loaded with restrictive terms, say that the farm shall henceforth be run in a particular way, that the new farmer will be tied into BRK products, plant, software etc, a set of conditions that steer the target farm towards an ‘interface with the larger conglomerate’. So, tomorrow’s UK kulaks will be forcibly collectivised. Not by Uncle Joe and his Chekists but by their capitalist equivalent. Ask any Ukrainian how that process played out.Many farms will fail. No worries, BRK or its stooges will already have a contractual right to buy up the assets that precludes sale by auction. Now this may be tricky as the farmer’s clearers probably have first call and the preferred creditors will have to be dealt with. But, hey, even if BRK has to buy at auction, they’ll still be getting a bargain. Economies of scale will facilitate increasing profitability. Priestley suggests, perhaps a step too far, that government could arrange with BRK to utilise illegal immigrants as farm labour.Too Orwellian perhaps?

Syria's Islamist coup could destroy one of the world's oldest Christian communities,"ISLAMIST rebels have taken Damascus and the regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen. The world rejoices and there are street celebrations by exiled Syrians in the major cities of the West. Politicians includingSir Keir Starmerwelcome the fall of Assad’s ‘barbaric regime’ as a ‘very good thing for the Syrian people’. And the Christians of Syria flee. Since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, 90 per cent of Christians have abandoned Aleppo, the country’s second largest city. Will the remaining 10 per cent remain to welcome their jihadi ‘liberators’? What centuries of Islamic oppression was unable to do, the civil war managed and the overthrow of the Assad regime will probably complete: the destruction of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. It was on the road to Damascus that Saul, the persecutor of Christians, met the risen Christ and became Paul, the greatest of missionaries and theologians who wrote much of the New Testament. It was in the then Syrian city of Antioch (present day Antakya, in Turkey) that followers of The Way were first called Christians. Syria produced many of the saints and fathers of the early church such as Ephrem the Syrian and Eusebius of Caesarea. Two thousand years of Christianity in Syria may soon be coming to an end. TheCatholic Archbishop of Aleppohas described this as the end of Christianity’s presence in the city. ‘We are really tired,’ he said. ‘We are really exhausted, and we are also finished, in every sense.’ Speaking of the armed groups who have taken over he said, ‘The Christians of Aleppo will be convinced that they cannot stay. That it is over for them. In Aleppo they are trying to bring about the end of the rich, magnificent and unique history of the Christians of Aleppo.’ Christians suffered just as much under Assad’s rule as the other citizens of Syria and had no affection for the president. They aligned themselves with the regime not through choice but out of necessity, to save themselves from being slaughtered by the radical Muslim jihadis. Now that the jihadis are in control of the country the Christians of Syria are in a perilous situation. Speaking of the ‘rebels’ who have overthrown Assad, the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II said, ‘So, let there be no doubt: they are anti-Christian. They call us infidels. Many believe that it’s their duty to slaughter us in order to offer a sacrifice to their god.’ As the jihadis advanced through the country, many Christians fled the villages and cities in their path. They sought refuge in the formerly government-controlled ‘Valley of Christians’ or Wadi al-Nasara. The community in the Valley responded by opening their homes, churches and community halls to offer shelter and support to the displaced. Now that the Valley has fallen under jihadi control following the collapse of the Assad government, the lives of the Christians there are in jeopardy. The mainstream media refers to the jihadis as ‘moderate rebels’ when they are neither moderate nor rebels. These militants want a theocratic country ruled by sharia law. When the terrorist groupHay’at Tahrir al-Sham(Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant; HTS) launched their attack on the Aleppo Governorate in north-western Syria, theycapturedandkilleddozens of Syrian Army soldiers, and promised mass executions and beheadingsin front of TV cameras.Videosof jihadistsabductingKurdish women have surfaced on social media. While we can be glad that Assad has fallen, we should not forget HTS is a jihadist group with origins in Al Qaeda and ISIS, including the remnants of the group led by the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi, a Palestinian Jordanian known as the ‘sheikh of the slaughterers’. These are no democracy-loving liberals: wherever they have had authority, they have inflicted abuse. We should be under no illusion that everything in Syria is going to be transformed for the good, that freedom of speech and action will be established. HTS aim to establish a theocracy. The situation if anything is going to be worse for all of Syria’s citizens and especially for the minorities: Alawites, Kurds and Christians. Since the violent Muslim conquest of Syria in AD 634-638, generation after generation of Syria’s Christians have been oppressed and despised by the Muslim majority. When Muslims treat Jews and Christians as equals they are being unfaithful to the teachings of their holy book. The Koran clearly teaches that Jews and Christians should have second-class status. A look across to Islamic North Africa and the Middle East would bear this out. It is difficult to find any instances in the Arab Islamic world of Christians living in harmony and peace under Islamic rule. Egypt has a large Christian population which existed long before the creation of Islam, yet the Coptic Christians live as second-class citizens in their own country. Still those who govern us continue to welcome into our countries the kind of people who have destroyed the Christian minorities in their own lands. Islamists can persecute, murder and drive out ancient Christian communities, and you won’t hear a word from our tolerant Western governments. We should try to be respectful and compassionate, but not at the cost of naively closing our eyes to the realities faced by Christians in Muslim-dominated countries. It is possible for governments to show concern about the situation facing Christians in Muslim-dominated lands. Hungary has its ownstate secretary to assist persecuted Christians. The much-maligned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recently met Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II and pledged continued support for Christians in need. How will the UK government react to the plight of Syria’s Christians? Will there be speeches from the front bench in their defence, will they be welcomed here and given accommodation and support as they try to rebuild their lives: or will they be ignored and left to the mercies of the jihadis? Given the Labour Party’s reliance on the Muslim vote there is little doubt which stance the Starmer government will take.

Covid didn’t cause the surge in excess deaths — the 'pandemic' response did,"MOST excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic can be linked to biological stress brought on by coordinated and large-scale mandates and medical assaults — ranging from lockdowns to vaccination to denial of antibiotics and antivirals — according toa paperreleased Monday by excess mortality researcherDenis Rancourt PhD. The theory that the novel virus and its variants spread globally, causing cascading pandemics and massive numbers of related deaths, cannot account for the actual patterns of excess death worldwide during the 2020-2023covidperiod, Rancourt argues. That narrative has been used to justify permanent vaccination campaigns to repeatedly boost national immunity against new variants. However, it can’t explain what caused 31millionglobal excess deathsduring the pandemic period according to Rancourt, a lead scientist for 20-plus years at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Instead, he argues excess deaths between 2020-2023 can largely be attributed to illnesses including certain types of bacterial pneumonia, also known asaspirationpneumonia, that were often misdiagnosed on death certificates as covid. He says such illnesses typically occur when biological stress affects the immune system making people more susceptible to infections that come from the microbes and parasites in their own bodies, a phenomenon more common among the elderly and immunocompromised. Rancourt concludes: ‘Within the present state of knowledge, it is possible that the declared covid pandemic (2020-2023) was entirely caused by the coordinated and largescalemandates, measures, so-called responses, and medical assaults including testing, diagnostic bias, isolation, denial of treatment (especially antibiotics for pneumonia), mechanical ventilation, sedation, experimental and improper treatments, and vaccination.’ If that is the case, Rancourt says, the medical establishment has ‘vastly underestimated and largely disregarded’ the impact of biological — including psychological — stress on health and mortality. Rancourt also suggests that this theory of stress-induced mortality could account for ‘all pandemics within recorded history’ because most have occurred amid major societal and environmental crises. The paper builds on extensive research into covidpandemic-related all-cause mortalityby Rancourt and his colleagues at the Canadian nonprofitCorrelation Research in the Public Interestover the last several years. It is published on the organisation’s website. Rancourt and his colleagueshave argued that key characteristics of excess mortality during the pandemic period contradict the argument that the covid virus was responsible for that mortality. For example, excess mortality varied significantly from country to country, but didn’t cross jurisdictional borders — so there wasn’t evidence that a virus with consistent virulence was spreading from one place to another. Rancourt also noted that none of the excess mortality peaks preceded theWorld Health Organization’s announcementon March 11, 2020, that covid was a global pandemic. Instead,excess mortality peaksfollowed vaccine and booster rollouts in many countries. Citing US data,Rancourt found strong evidencethat respiratory infections were the primary condition associated with excess all-cause mortality. However those deaths may have been designated on death certificates as covid, when the primary cause of death was actually something else, he wrote. For example, Rancourt and colleagues previously found that more than half of the deaths attributed to covid likely included co-occurring bacterial pneumonia. They concluded thatPCR testing schemesled to many bacterial pneumonia infections being misdiagnosed as covid during a time when key treatments such as antibiotics andivermectinwere withdrawn. Research shows that social and environmental stressors are a major determinant ofhealth, including death, according to Rancourt. Psychological stress and social isolation have particularly strong associations with respiratory infections and their severity, as does age. Rancourt toldThe Defenderthat the massive socio-economic disruptions associated with the pandemic subjected societies worldwide to major stressors. Recent studies on mice showed that even a single episode ofrestraint and immobilisation stresscould lead to severe immunosuppression, leaving them vulnerable to bacterial infections. The study suggested that confinement in humans could produce similar effects, Rancourt wrote. Disruptions included lockdowns, which increased social isolation, and deprived people of incomes and limited mobility. Fear-driven propaganda terrorised people, and those who resisted mainstream narratives about the virus andvaccinesexperienced aggression and marginalisation. Hospitals and medical providers imposed aggressive and experimental medical interventions on some people, including the systematic use ofventilators,experimental treatment protocolsandpalliative carefor those who were severely ill. Others were denied access to medications like ivermectin or antibiotics. Rancourt also pointed to temporal correlations betweenvaccine and booster rolloutsand increases in excess all-cause mortality in every country with sufficient data. It is highly unlikely that the vaccine-mortality associations are coincidental, he wrote. He toldThe Defenderthis spike could be due tovaccine toxicityitself. Or, he said, the vaccine rollouts could have corresponded with other aggressive medical or health interventions. Combining the covid vaccines withother vaccines, and the stress of coercive vaccination, could have weakened people’s immune systems. It is also possible that multiple factors were at play, he said. Rancourt believes the most compelling explanation for most excess deaths — namely the surges in respiratory deaths often associated with the excess deaths — is that a combination of different social, political and medically induced stressors led to widespread aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia, which doesn’t require person-to-person transmission, is a dominant cause of death among the elderly, particularly in care homes and hospitals. Treatment requires proper diagnosis and the administration of antibiotics. Risk factors include immunosuppression, and several pandemic-related factors, including denial of antibiotics, ventilation, overuse of sedatives and hypnotics, tube feeding, depression, and disruptions to the digestive system caused by interventions. If this is correct, Rancourt said, the primary cause of death contributing to spikes in all-cause mortality was ‘covid-period mandates and measures’ that made people susceptible to these illnesses.

A book to destroy faith in doctors for ever,"Worth A Shot? Secrets of the Clinical Trial Participant Who Inspired a Global Movement – Brianne Dressen’s Storyby Caroline Pover* TALES of abuse are harrowing, but a hundred times worse when the perpetrators are governments. This book is brutally honest about our inadequate and ignorant medical profession, state-sponsored covid vaccine injury, suicide, despair and the fight for justice. Governments, social media and mainstream media committed terrible abuses with monumental efforts to keep those disabled and bereaved by covid vaccines apart. They needed support, and solutions for chronic conditions developed post vaccine such as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), transverse myelitis and post-vaccine neuropathy. Gaslit by the medical profession, victims such as pre-school teacher Brianne Dressen (AstraZeneca), retired gastroenterologist Dr Danice Hertz (Pfizer), dental hygienist Kristi Hobbs (also Pfizer), triathlete Candace Hayden (Moderna) and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Joel Wallskog (also Moderna), describe how they determined to expose those abuses. What they discovered destroyed their faith in doctors and drug regulatory agencies for ever. Without first-hand experience, none would have believed their government could disown them because ‘doing the right thing’ went wrong. As they unpeeled layers of the onion to work out why no one in authority would help, they found terrible conflicts of interest. For example, Dr Peter Marks, director of the Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for ensuring efficacy and safety of all pharmaceuticals, oversaw covid vaccine development and approval, monitored post-marketing safetyandpromoted the jabs to the public. To counteract vaccine hesitancy to the warp-speed experimental shots, in a Q&A webinar Marks co-opted NFL football stars to persuade fans and other players to get jabbed. Trainee psychotherapist Sheryl Reuttgers, who’d had a severe neurological reaction to the Moderna vaccine, joined the Zoom, typing in: ‘What do you think about vaccine injuries?’ and ‘What about the NIH [US National Institutes of Health] studying vaccine harms?’ Her questions were erased while Marks told young, able-bodied athletes that the worst reaction to expect was some mild myocarditis and a trip to the ER. ‘But you’d recover with some Tylenol and rest,’ he said. Injury affected whole families, not just the injured. Brianne was suicidal for six months post-injury and although she tried to keep a smile on her face, the effect on her children Hannah, six, and Cooper, eight, was clear. Hannah wrote little love notes that she pushed under the door to the bedroom she was supposed to stay out of. They said, ‘I love my mommy!’ or ‘You are the BEST mommy in the whole world!’ surrounded by hearts. Cooper became angry and afraid, refusing to go to school. He needed to know where his mother was at all times. Social media, not the medical profession, became a lifeline to the injured, especially those confined to bed and to one room 24/7 looking for support. It was where they shared information about treatments, experimenting with anything that might help. But it became a source of frustration when they were heavily shadow-banned by Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. When Mark Zuckerberg shut down all but one Facebook group sharing vaccine injury stories, there was a new suicide. The woman had been posting cries for help on her private page for months, growing angrier and angrier as algorithms dramatically reduced her visibility. It’s no surprise thatWorth a Shotis dedicated to ‘all those injured by the Covid vaccine, those we have lost because of it, and all who love them’. Meanwhile, governments still have these injurious jabs in their wellness schedules, and their hands over their ears. *Award-winning British author and entrepreneurCaroline Poveris chair of trustees forUKCVFamily, a charity set up to support the vaccine injured in England and Wales.

Staggering ignorance that scuppered sterling and the stock exchange,"IN THE Chancellor’s recent Budget and her speech at the Mansion House she extolled the importance of economic growth. On this we agree. However, in my short time in Parliament I have come to realise that the economic ignorance, lack of suitability or any business experience of anyone in the Labour Party (and indeed most Tories) as well as a failure to grasp the basic demands of economic growth is ubiquitous. The current generation are staggeringly ill-informed. The Blairite years successfully obstructed any economic growth and progress with swathes of unnecessary legislation, sowing all manner of future minefields of obstruction, obfuscation and confusion that we and future generations are now floundering in. Blairite legislation has put the State in charge. No one has had the courage to challenge this self-serving status quo which is so deeply entrenched that it comfortably ignores changing elected governments. The current political incumbents are the children of this former era. They don’t question because they don’t know how, they don’t have any references or experience of sensible economic behaviour. If the readily accepted personal bribes offered to senior party members are a guide, they don’t understand right from wrong either, and simply ignore any criticism. If their behaviour is not questioned by the State, it must be acceptable. That other MPs and the electorate can simply be ignored is reminiscent of the relationship between Roman Emperors of the first century AD and the Praetorian Guard with the people. These students of socialism believe that spending money on the state is somehow ‘investment’. As Elon Musk recently said, ‘All government spending is taxation.’ This is not to say that spending on infrastructure and essential services is not important and that local economies will not benefit from projects, but it must be seen for what it is: spending taxpayers’ money. National economic growth must be driven by the private sector. GDP includes both the state and private sectors; the shrinking value of the private sector in the UK has not been subject to any real scrutiny for many years. Because the private sector has to contribute so much in taxation, we need metrics to gauge its robustness to do so. We should also be able to compare our private sector internationally. The capitalisation of the stock market is not comprehensive in terms of the value of business activity in the private sector, but major trends are a useful gauge of its health. Our private sector and our currency exchange rates better illustrate the scale of the UK’s demise. The UK entry level capital market is the AIM with a capitalisation of roughly $50billion. In the US the NASDAQ is over $20trillion. In 2023 the UK market capitalisation was roughly $2.8trillion, the US market was about $100trillion. These numbers are rough, but they illustrate how far behind the UK private sector lags. Apple’s valuation is greater than the entire FTSE 100. This differential was nowhere near as marked in the 1990s as it is now, so why has this gulf opened? State regulation has succeeded in asphyxiating our capital market; it has destroyed confidence with the imposition of ever-evolving obstruction iterations of regulated firms, entrepreneurs and investors with red tape under their wide-ranging and conveniently loose interpretations of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and its EU cousin MIFID I and II before Brexit. EU regulation has persistently endeavoured to obstruct equity markets because capital in Europe is delivered mainly and traditionally by bank lending, not by flotation on stock markets such as the London Stock Exchange. This matters in the UK because firms quoted on the LSE generate wealth and employment, pay pensions and make tax contributions. In short, they grow the economy. Anglo-Saxon markets such as London and New York are traditionally stock markets that provide major capital funding to larger quoted corporate constituents. Our government has utterly destroyed our competitive position partly because we have allowed our main capital market funding tradition to be crippled by FSMA and EU regulation, and no one says a word – perhaps because they don’t understand? In 2007 the USD/GBP exchange rate was nearer 2. It reflects what the market thinks of the UK. At the time of the recent election, it was 1.30 and this week it was 1.26. Oil is priced in USD and we have to have it. As debt dramatically increases post Budget and economic mismanagement continues, expect it to fall further to a point where alarm bells ring, No 10 will be on the phone to the independent Bank of England and UK interest rates will have to rise to avoid importing inflation and catastrophe. The new US administration will strengthen the USD further to the point where they will want to weaken their currency to make it competitive so they will cut interest rates which will make the US economy even stronger. Expect USD/GBP parity during this Parliament. You may have noticed that Norwich City, the nearest big football club to my Great Yarmouth constituency, like other clubs is now majority-owned by Americans. In the case of Norwich City they want to get the club back into the Premier League in the next five years. The club is a cheap way to get access to one of our remaining (but increasingly rare) successful global brands, the Premier League. It attracts hundreds of millions of viewers, particularly in Asia, and is a source of immense soft power. Let’s hope the Canaries make it before the Government’s proposed regulation destroys another British success as it has our financial markets. Be in no doubt we are in serious trouble, so at the Mansion House last month the supposedly independent non-political Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey surprisingly announced that we should build bridges with the EU to promote economic growth, no doubt just before it is hit with US trade tariffs. He also said that the US ‘has a better story to tell’, almost as though they are out of our league. The Chancellor, who, judging by the Budget, hasn’t a clue about the real muddle the country is in, feebly announced changes to the Financial Conduct Authority’s senior management regime and an investigation into promoting growth with the regulators in the spring. The FCA will no doubt engage full self-serving mode and run rings round her. The only way that our financial markets can get back on their feet for future generations is the repeal of FSMA 2000 and abolition of the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), neither of which has made any meaningful contribution to the UK economy. Regulation, or more likely just the law, is needed to ensure market participants act as principal or agent, identify clients and counterparties and identify and manage conflicts of interest. If this country does not wake up and start working properly and responsibly, Reform’s majority that will take power in 2029 will be dealing with the IMF as well as with the delivery of its Great Repeal Bill.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-04T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/staggering-ignorance-that-scuppered-sterling-and-the-stock-exchange/
Oxbridge and the cancellation of kindness,"A WEEK or so agoI wrote a piece discussing the tragic suicide of Oxford student Alexander Rogers in January. I wrote: ‘Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn’t happy about. As pertheTimes,“She had expressed ‘discomfort’ about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the ‘allegations’. They told him they believed he had ‘messed up’, that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later. ‘Rogers had appeared “distraught after this conversation”. He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation . . . ‘The coroner looking into Alexander’s death explained how the isolation at the college worked. “The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] ‘pile-on’ might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual. ‘In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a “pile-on” and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape.’ TheTimeshas done a follow-up andspoken to some students who enjoyed that most coveted experience, an undergraduate degree at Oxbridge. Cambridge graduate Ceci Browning, 23, said, ‘It is the paradox of my generation. We are supposedly the most tolerant and liberal, the most concerned with getting it right, and yet when one of our comrades slips up and falls out of step, they become the enemy. We cut friends and acquaintances from our lives on the basis of second-hand information about something deemed morally iffy that they may or may not have done, but we are also all perpetually afraid that precisely the same thing could happen to us.’ She also said: ‘The other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness. A policy of “one strike and you’re out”. Being a social justice warrior is no longer about being anti-government or anticapitalism, like the heralded student activism of the 20th century. Now, it’s anti-exoneration. Prisoners – those committed for more minor crimes, anyway – eventually get released and rehabilitated. But if you’re cancelled at university, you’re cancelled for ever.’ So, this is what middle-class parents bankrupt themselves for by sending their children to independent school (fees now have VAT) in the ultimate hope of getting into Oxbridge. In addition to enduring the inevitable hot-housing, the incredible pressure of navigating the Oxbridge entry system (interview, exam and A-levels) which will take a mental toll even on the best and brightest, your reward is: walking on eggshells for three or four years, living in the fear of being cancelled, or confirmed social ostracism. In fact the risk is so terrifying around sexual intimacy that the young men barely bother. ‘We’re quite scared of any sexual encounters with girls in case we get something wrong. Being honest, sex is quite hard to get right,’ one studying at Glasgow told theTimes. ‘And if you don’t, it feels like the jeopardy is so high it’s almost not worth the risk.’ Look, I understand the attraction of an Oxbridge degree (stealth boast incoming). I did a master’s at Darwin College, Cambridge, tutored for a term at Worcester College, Oxford, and worked and lived in Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. And sure, the architecture alone means that if you get to study at one of these colleges, you have won the lotto in life. For undergraduates the settings are 2/3 students to one tutor. Even in the best London universities a tutorial is about 10 to 15 students in a class (I did this also at UCL). You don’t even get this at the Ivy League universities in the US. Yes, it is an amazing experience to study at Oxbridge. Or at least it should be, but with all this cancel culture you wonder if is it still worthwhile. It is probably true that there are similar brutal cancellations and unkindness at most elite UK universities, a veritable competition in cruelty, all in the name of kindness. Haven’t the young people suffered enough? Didn’t they have to go through lockdown, and will graduate with huge debts? And what is worse is that at the end of it all, they don’t even have a chance to make true friends, to enjoy the loyal understanding of a mate should they make a mistake. I am not saying that a true friend must condone everything a wayward friend does. True charity requires that you tell your friend if they have done wrong, to themselves or to others. But that doesn’t mean you just abandon them. That doesn’t mean you just toss them aside into a desert of loneliness and encourage others to do the same. I find it truly frightening that young men and women could behave like this. It is far more terrifying than the risk of drink or drugs to your child. Those things can ruin your child’s body; being cancelled, being placed firmly outside the circle, will destroy their soul. What I found most depressing in theTimesarticle was the observation by Ms Browning that ‘the other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness’. Ah, such is the joy of the post-Christian age. What progress! Not for this generation the idea that ‘let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. Sure, these students, the elite, could bang out a 2,000-word essay on the rule of law, but they’d struggle to explain why the father forgave his returning prodigal son. Most of these Oxbridge graduates will survive their university years and go on to become professionally successful. That’s what having an Oxbridge degree gives you. We can only hope they learn about the importance of forgiveness, charity, loyalty and simple kindness as they move into public life, shaping policies we ourselves will have to live by.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-03T01:20:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/oxbridge-and-the-cancellation-of-kindness/
MSM silence as health coalition urges governments: Stop the jabs now,"ON MONDAY November 25 an international group of politicians, leading medical and other professionals, supported by Professor Francis Boyle, author of the US ‘Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorist Act of 1989’, wrote to the heads of state of ten European countries, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, calling for a suspension of modified mRNA vaccines citing serious health concerns. Ireland joined the call later in the week. The indefatigable retired paediatrician Ros Jones once more has been a leading light in organising it. As the newly formed North Group they sent the letter as a ‘notice of extreme concern’ regarding excessive levels of residual DNA identified in Australian vaccine samples that confirmed similar findings from France, Germany, Canada, and the USA. Their notice warned that the introduction of foreign DNA into cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) may damage human DNA leading to genomic instability, cancer and other extremely serious conditions. It also pointed out that: ● It was a lottery as to which batch a person received and the side effects – including death – they experienced. ● Vaccines were never tested for their ability to block transmission. Medical product regulators, as well as government agencies, misled the public when coercing them into accepting the products. ● Multiple independent analyses show that modified mRNA vaccines contain variable but alarmingly high levels of residual DNA. All these issues, the long list of international signatories agree, are grounds for extreme concern regarding risks to human health and potential for genetic damage that were never accounted for scientifically in the authorisation process of the novel mRNA vaccines. This is why they are calling for: ● An immediate halt to the use of modified mRNA vaccines. ● An independent and transparent investigation into their approval and use. ● Scientific evidence that shows that there is no risk of damage to human DNA.

UK supermarkets join Lurpak maker's trial of methane-reducing chemical in cows,"LAST WEEK the Danish-based dairy foods giant Arla announced a collaboration with three UK supermarkets, Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, to trial Bovaer, a feed additive, aiming to reduce methane emissions. The following is a transcript of the video commentary on the social media announcement: ‘The latest innovation we’re looking at is Bovaer. Bovaer is a feed additive developed by Dutch company DSM that allows farmers to reduce enteric methane emissions from our dairy herds. Enteric methane being what the cows produce during their natural digestive process. Today, we’ve been working with Arla and DSM as part of the Bovaer set-up process, learning about what’s involved and how we can make the pilot as successful as possible. ‘So the reason we are quite excited about Bovaer, it’s not just some fairy dust that somebody thinks might make some improvements but it’s been really rigorously and extensively tested. Trials like these are really important to help reduce our carbon footprint.’ Arla Foods is a major player in the UK dairy market. It supplies milk to retailers and produces brands such as Lurpak, Anchor, Cravendale, Lactofree and Castello. Bovaer is a product owned by Netherlands-based DSM-Firmenich, a company whose work ‘supports the development of a more sustainable global animal production industry’ and is part of the fake-food and synthetic biology sector. It has been authorised for use in more than 50 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the US and EU countries. It was authorised in the UK in April this year. DSM’swebsitestates: ‘Bovaer® contributes to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of beef and dairy products. Just a quarter teaspoon per cow per day reduces methane emissions from dairy cattle by 30 per cent and up to 45 per cent for beef cattle, on average.’ According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock produce12 per centof global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Efforts to combat ‘climate change’ have long focused on livestock. In January 2023, Bill Gates’s investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) led a $12million seed funding round intoRumin8, a rival Australian start-up focused on developing feed supplements to reduce methane emissions from livestock. Arla’s announcement caused quite a stir on social media with many accounts calling for a boycott of their products. 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) is the active ingredient in Bovaer. Other ingredients include silicon dioxide and propylene glycol. 3-NOP inhibits the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase in the rumen (the first stomach compartment in ruminant animals), preventing the final step in methane production. It has been claimed that the additive has no side effects. However, while looking through some of the available reports, certain anomalies stand out. A letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter addressed to Elanco US, Inc, (which has an agreement with DSM-Firmenich to market Bovaer), states: ‘Bovaer® 10 is an article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal, and thereforeit is a drug.However, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has considered whether it intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to certain requirements applicable to animal drugs for Bovaer® 10 – including requirements regarding new animal drug approval, pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practice, adverse event reporting, labeling, drug establishment registration and drug product listing.CVM has considered whether refraining from enforcement of these requirements at this time would be appropriate based on whether Bovaer® 10 poses a low risk to humans and animals and whether the data show that the product has the intended effect. Based on a review of your data and the characteristics of your product, FDA has no questions at this time regarding whether Bovaer® 10 will achieve its intended effect and is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals under the conditions of its intended use.’ The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) seems to be sending mixed messages. Although Bovaer is officially classified as a drug, the CVM appears to have decided not to enforce certain drug regulations, including the obligation for adverse event reporting. This decision is based on the belief that Bovaer ‘is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals’. Paradoxically, the letter includes an attachment with the following troubling statements. Turning to thesafety assessment reportfor Bovaer, prepared by the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS), which was reviewed by the Animal Feed and Feed Additives Joint Expert Group (AFFAJEG) and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF). According to ACAF: ‘the additive can be considered safe for consumers’ yet this conclusion is seemingly contradicted by the statement: ‘The additive should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant and potentially harmful by inhalation.’ Notably, the assessment states: ‘In their first evaluation, members observed thatno analysis was performed on the final product to screen for dioxins and heavy metals.‘ This was followed by a request made by AFFAJEG for the applicant to provide an analysis of impurities in the final product. In the two tolerance studies presented in DSM’s application in relation to safety for the target species: ‘Study 1 used only 4 cows per group, which were given 0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg 3-NOP/kg feed DM for 90 days.The highest dose showed a reduced intake of feed and a reduced heart weight.’ Study 2 was larger and used 20 cows per group ‘which were given doses of 3-NOP of 0, 80, 100, or 200 mg/kg feed DM for 56 days’. At the highest dose (the 200 mg dose group), negative results were identified which included ‘decreased ovary size, decreased serum activities of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and reduced feed and water intake.’ The report went on: ‘The decrease in ovarian size was not accompanied by histopathological change and it was concluded that it should not be considered an adverse effect of the study at the 200 mg/kg dose . . .The Group concluded that the additive could be considered safe at a dose of 200 mg/kg and that a margin of tolerance of 2 could be established.’ In relation to safety studies for the consumer, a two-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats showed ‘mesenchymal cell tumours were reported in 4 out of 49 femalesat the top dose of 300 mg/kg bw/day of 3-NOP given orally. Based on these results, theoriginal study report concluded there was evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats.‘ Curiously, this conclusion was changed after an independent group was brought in to ‘reanalyse the study’s slides’. This group concluded that ‘mesenchymal cell tumours were present in 3 out of 49 femalesat the top dose group, which wasno longer statistically significantlydifferent from the control group’. The AFFAJEG concluded that at the higher dose levels (300 mg/kg/day in females), the additive has the potential to cause mesenchymal cell hyperplasia and benign tumours. However, due to the ‘absence of malignant tumours and genotoxicity, it was concluded that the additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate and benign tumours occurred only above the NOAEL [the no observed adverse effect level, the greatest concentration or amount of a substance at which no detectable adverse effects occur in an exposed population]’. In the genotoxocity studies testing whether 3-NOP is toxic to genes, it was noted ‘that positive results occurred in Chinese hamster V79 cells, with negative results in a study using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an equivocal result in a study using TK6 cells’. Positive results indicate that the substance tested has the potential to cause genetic damage. In a second study, the results were negative except for males dosed at the top dose and sacrificed at 24 hours, in which micronuclei were statistically significantly increasedcompared to the negative control. Alarmingly, the report went on to state: ‘Based on the OECD guidance on establishing the biological relevance of a result in this assay, which is neither clearly positive nor clearly negative, AFFAJEG members recognised the requirement for external expert judgement. An external consultant, contracted by the applicant [DSM],concluded that the apparent increase in micronuclei may have been an artifact due to the Giemsa-based stain that was used, to which Group experts agreed. The Group concluded that 3-NOP is non-genotoxic in vivo.” This raises alarm bells considering it was an external consultant paid by the applicant (DSM) who attributed another cause for the increase in micronuclei – the stain used – not 3-NOP, the active ingredient in DSM’s product Bovaer.

UPDATE 4.30pm: Marks & Spencer also use Bovaer TCWreader Hermien Dyer who wrote to Marks & Spencer received this reply: Dear Hermien DyerThank you for taking the time to contact Stuart Machin [the firm’s CEO]. As a member of the Executive Team, I am responding on his behalf. We’d like to reassure you that health and welfare of our cows is our number one priority, so that we can offer our customers the highest welfare, highest quality milk on the market. The cows in our M&S Select Farm Milk Pool are cared for by farmers we know and trust to meet the highest animal welfare standards. The cows in our milk pool are pasture grazed and, in poor weather, they are fed a forage-based diet designed to meet their nutritional needs. Our British Select Farmers add Bovaer, a feed supplement made from corn fermentation derivatives and mineral salts, which prevents the digestive enzymes from forming methane and is naturally broken down in the cow’s stomachs. There is absolutely no harm to the cow and no impact on the milk in any way. Bovaer has been extensively studied around the world and it’s been proven that it’s safe for cows, farmers and consumers. This initiative is one part of how we are taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions and become a net zero business by 2040. Thank you again for taking the time to write.

Still time to pull back from slippery suicide slope,"MPs have voted forKim Leadbeater’s Assisted Dying Billon its second reading. Despite all the warnings from around the world, a majority voted for the Labour MP’s private member’s Bill to legalise what should more properly be called assisted suicide, but which would most likely have received much less support if it had not relied on cosy euphemisms for what is essentially the State helping dying people to kill themselves. Indeed, such proposals are so shrouded in fluffy phrases that many think ‘assisted dying’ means merely helping patients to have a more comfortable natural death. Most likely this explains why a majority of the public have appeared to support such a measure – although, tellingly, that majority tends to shrink as the manifold problems are highlighted in detailed discussion. But perhaps for this reason, when opponents raise the practical and ethical problems of this ‘compassionate’, ‘autonomous’, ‘de-lifing’ process – the danger of ‘slippery slopes’ – they are accused of‘scaremongering’. However, that term might be more usefully directed at the practice of scaring vulnerable individuals into believing they will ‘die in agony’ if they do not have the choice that means the end of all choice. And in all this discussion there has been a strange, one might almost say eerie, silence about‘ordinary’ suicides, which are known to increase in number in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal. Indeed, despite the well-known fact that suggestion plays a significant role in suicide ideation, the constant talk about deliberate death being an answer to suffering may well move people who are not ‘dying anyway’, but are suicidally inclined, to take that final, fatal step.But we are meant to believe ‘assisted dying’ is not suicide, therefore instead of engaging in ‘suicide prevention’ we must engage in suicide promotion. As for ‘slippery slopes’,Ms Leadbeater’s Bill itself resembles a slope growing more slippery by the day: while stressing its ‘strict safeguards’, she herself has hinted at its broader application – even acknowledging that being a ‘burden’ on others could be a legitimate reason for seeking ‘assisted dying’: ‘I know I wouldn’t want to be a burden to people, I can say that to you now in the clear light of day. But that’s very different to people saying, I’m doing this because I feel like I’m being a burden.’ As for ‘safeguards’,the ban on assisting suicide could be seen as the ‘safeguard’that allowed Parliament to decriminalise suicide in 1961. It has taken a while, but finally, in 2024, we have ‘come the long way round’ to dismantling that particular safeguard – arguably the most important. And among all the reasons why the Leadbeater Bill is so risky is that noted byformer Chief Coroner Thomas Teague.Hesaysthe bill is unsafe for the very fact that it removes the statutory duty to investigate suicides. You do need even have to ponder that for 30 seconds to compute the implications. Unlike in other jurisdictions that legalised ‘assisted dying’ with out any evidence from other countries and now find themselves a long way down the slippery slope, our politicians have no excuse. Most seem to have decided to ignore the red flags from abroad, voting in favour of the Bill for ideological reasons instead of heeding the evil practical consequences and swerving at the last minute. This puts one in mind of lemmings, but in this case it will likely not be them who end up plunging over the cliff – rather it will be the weakest and most vulnerable in society. With the legal guardrails torn down, there will be no protection – nothing to defend them from the siren call of suicide. As Conservative MP Danny Kruger, previously chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well,concluded in his speech during the debate on the Second Reading: ‘I’m talking about the people who lack agency: the people who know what it is to be excluded from power, to have decisions made for them by bigwigs in distant offices speaking a language they don’t understand . . . Not the ones who write to us campaigning for a change in the law, but the people who come to our surgeries with their lives in tatters, or who the police and social workers tell us about, the people with complex needs. What are the safeguards for them? I will tell you. We are the safeguards. This place. This Parliament. You and me. We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm, and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.’ It is highly appropriate that this Bill should have passed its second reading on ‘Black Friday’, but there is still time to raise our voices in warning against this disaster waiting to happen, while we still can command our voices – enabling our long island story to have a happy ending, rather than history recording that ‘they all died unhappily ever after’.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-01T01:16:00+00:00,Features,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/still-time-to-pull-back-from-slippery-suicide-slope/
This sneaky assisted-suicide Bill strikes against decency and genuine choice,"‘The Rubicon is a very small stream, but on the other side of it is a very different world, a worse world, with a very different idea of human value’ –Danny Kruger MP. THE BILL to legalise state-assisted suicide has been passed at its second reading in the Commons by 330 votes to 275.The legislative momentum suggests that, subject to further scrutiny and amendment, the Bill will eventually become an Act of law. Parliamentary procedure is always glacial. We should take little comfort in this. The principle that life is sacred was itself euthanised on Friday, and that happened quickly enough. The Establishment patsy Kim Leadbeater introduced her Bill before morning coffee. It was voted through by afternoon tea.From her performance, which included a forced apology for misleading the House, you’d be forgiven for concluding she hadn’t had time to read it. And yes, I’m going to call this ‘assisted suicide’and not ‘assisted dying’because I think it fair that those who are effecting this change should be held to account for it. If the harpy avatars of the latest statist death cult are ‘offended’ by my choiceof language, that’s excellent. It is an obligation arising from charity to give offence to those who are keen to take it. You’d think they’d be careful with the rehearsed pearl-clutching, come to think of it. The sponsors of the Bill insist that the legal ‘safeguards’ are robust and crystal clear. This is not convincing when at the same time they presume to be able to change the meaning of words by fiat. A quick comment on those safeguards. Their ostensible purpose is to prevent the practical application of a subsequent Act from being expanded in scope beyond the clearly stated provisions of that Act. Their real function, of course, is to act as markers for the future attention of activist lawyers. The ‘safeguards’ are like a Mafia kiss: intended to hide malicious intent with insincere reassurance. The Bill which was voted through on Friday embeds not immutable protections so much as mechanisms of useful ambiguity. Useful, that is, for those who are greasing the slippery slope. What makes an illness terminal? Why limit the prognosis to six months? Why not eighteen? Who counts as a ‘person of good standing’? Will the local traffic warden do? Etc. Parliamentary supporters of this legislation have a stated aim, one which sounds laudable. They wish to give back ‘choice’ to those people robbed of it by illness and circumstance. A person in great pain, and with no hope of remission from that pain, who has been failed by end-of-life care, or for whom palliative relief is ineffective, is owed by society this much at least: to be able to choose to die instead. That argument has an almost irresistible emotional force, and that is why as anargumentwe must be wary of it. It is so obvious to us that freedom is a good thing that we rarely ask what this axiomatically good thing is. Which is the better view of personal freedom: that it is just the ‘right’ to do as we wish? Or that it is more than this: that it is the ability to do what weought? It seems to me that those who think the state should have this role in terminating the life of a person need to answer two questions: ‘what is the state?’ and ‘what is a person?’ So far, they’ve failed to address either. We can assess the nature and role of the UK state by looking at how it discharged its duty of care during lockdown, when it showed its commitment to citizen autonomy by cancelling it and by mind-screwing us with prepared strategies of disguised coercion. In addition, it attempted to force us to undergo untested medical interventions which probably killed or maimed a significant number of those whose trust it so casually abused. And the Establishment view of the human person, as assumed by the ghastly midwit metaphysics of Kim Leadbeater, is that we are atomised calculating machines, who navigate the complexities of life in a sort of vacuum, insulated from the wider social consequences of the ‘choices’ it is our ‘right’ to make. Suffering is an unwanted but essential ingredient in a life worth living. That statement is obnoxious to the secular mind because that mind makes no room for the possibility of redemption through spiritual and physical pain. Yet it is a trivial truth to a mind which has been gifted the grace of faith. Where Leadbeateret alsee the suffering person as a burden, some of us see him as an opportunity for love. The philosopher Wittgenstein remarked that death is not an event in life, that we do not live to experience it. There are some things, he suggested, that are true but not statable. When we talk about the ethics of end-of-life care, we are operating at the very limits of what can be said. When you bring the state into that discussion you also grant admission to the cost-benefit fetishism that comprises the only language it understands. Its worldview is utilitarian, and utilitarianism is only capable of identifying and amplifying those features of a situation which are morally irrelevant. There used to be a way of doing these things, one which involved the tacit ‘nod and a wink’. This was the way of kindness, responsive to the urgencies of the moment and in no need of the crude intrusions of state machinery. It was not perfect but to borrow from Danny Kruger’s excellent reply to Leadbeater, it kept us onthisside of the Rubicon. A final point on those speeches. Diane Abbott was superb in articulating the point mentioned above: that not all coercion is obvious, and that state-enabled killing will exploit the unspoken but real anxieties of the most vulnerable. It was a ray of light on a very dark day.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-02T01:22:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-ghastly-assisted-suicide-bill-strikes-against-decency-and-genuine-choice/
COP29 reveals itself as the great fraud it always was,"WHATEVER perceptions have been conjured up in the past by the annual mega-junket that is the UN’s Conference Of the Parties on climate change, there can be no doubt this year’s COP29 descended into farce and ridicule. The puzzle is why it has taken so long for the vested interests who attend to begin to admit what it is – a massive stunt designed to fool the public into policies they would never otherwise support. The gathering of the world’s climate politicians, zealots, hustlers and grifters in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan – of all places – has finally tipped some, like Al Gore, over the edge because it sought to avoid discussing oil and gas production while secretly discussing sponsorship opportunities from oil and gas producers. The cult of Net Zero has its own Wizard of Oz resident in Azerbaijan, and the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the fraud being played on those believing the charade. Prior to its opening, Elnur Soltanov, Azerbaijan’s deputy energy minister and chief executive of COP29, was filmed by the campaign group Global Witness agreeing at the climate summit to facilitate oil or gas deals. It had posed undercover as a non-existent Hong Kong-based energy investment company willing to sponsor the event if it helped facilitate investment opportunities with Azerbaijan’s state energy firm, Socar. Mr Soltanov said he was open to discussions, including deals on oil and gas, and a few weeks later he emailed the Hong Kong front offering to help bring together the parties to a potential deal. The latest junket of cant and hypocrisy which generates its own vast emissions had already been off to a bad start when in its planning the Azerbaijan government of President Ilham Aliyev declared the event ‘The COP of Peace’. It was not so much a lack of self-awareness from the warmongering hosts as a laughable attempt at Orwellian newspeak, equivalent to framing North Korea as the land of feasting or Cuba as the destination of choice for a Pink Floyd light-show. It had been only a year before, in September 2023, that Azerbaijan military forces invaded the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, displacing 100,000 ethnic Armenians and making many others political prisoners, including several ministers of the former Armenian government of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan is an autocratic petrostate ruled with an iron fist by Ilham Aliyev, who took over from his father as president in 2003, following which he appointed his wife as vice-president. For context, Azerbaijan scored only seven out of 100 in Freedom House’s 2024 human-rights index – by comparison North Korea scored 3, Cuba 12, Russia 13 and the UK 91. In contrast Armenia scored 54. After Europe announced it was abandoning Russian gas because of Putin’s war in Ukraine, the European Parliament approved sanctions against President Aliyev and other Azeri government officials over their offensive against the Armenians – but the European Commission refused to implement them. Instead, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen flew to Baku, hailing the country as ‘a crucial energy partner’. The reason became obvious when the Financial Times and Sunday Times reported Azerbaijan had increased imports of Russian gas specifically to meet commitments made to EU countries looking for ‘non-Russian’ sources of gas in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. For many the sanctions were a pretence all along. All this bodes ill for mainly Christian Armenia, landlocked and of no strategic significance, sandwiched between Turkey to the west and Azerbaijan to the east – with Iran at the southern end of the Caspian Sea and Russia to the northern shore. Since the end of the Cold War and its escape from Soviet rule Armenia has been on a journey, pivoting toward the West and looking for friends. Unfortunately, so long as politicians in the UK, Europe and the US are happy to cavort with despots throwing their petrodollars around, Armenia will find doors repeatedly closing. If Western leaders had any interest in COP29 becoming a ‘COP of Peace’ they would have insisted President Aliyev sign a peace deal with Armenia in advance of the summit and release the remaining Armenian prisoners of war and political hostages held in Baku. But our Western leaders would rather posture on peace while closing their own energy-intensive industries and exporting those jobs to China and India while importing competitors’ products dependent on new coal-powered power stations – currently opening in China at the rate of two a week. The hour before dawn is always the darkest and coldest, the saying goes, so it is no surprise to find the UK, irrespective of the incumbent Government party, still charging ahead looking for a world leadership role at COP29. With Ed Miliband bringing a fresh dogmatic zeal to UK Net Zero initiatives, the consequent stupendous waste of public funds was highlighted by the Daily Mail revealing the UK had 470 expenses-paid delegates at the Baku beano, compared to 405 from the US, 437 from Italy, 325 from Germany and 115 from France. With sweet irony, COP29 coincided with the stunning victory of the climate realist Donald Trump as 47th President of the United States, giving focus to a crisis of confidence among those in the West driving toward Net Zero. Even before this seismic electoral turning point the number of academics willing to challenge the settled science of anthropogenic global warning has been rising. Hopefully COP29 will be recognised as different from the past summits because its curtain has been pulled back to reveal all the double dealing and empty rhetoric about ‘peace’ and the climate ‘crisis’. If that strengthens the resolve of Donald Trump to admonish Western democracies for killing their own industries to the benefit of autocratic powers we’ll have at least something to thank it for. Whatever one thinks about the role of man in creating a climate catastrophe, the West’s pursuit of Net Zero economies will achieve no impact against Asia’s drive to accelerate its use of carbon-reliant energy and industrial output. COP29 is no festival of peace, but neither will it save the planet from a climate ‘crisis’ – what it may well do is help reveal what a self-serving circus the Conference of the Parties has always been. Could the return of Trump and the hypocrisy of COP29 make 2024 the year the West finally wakes up to its climate self-delusion? Let us hope it is the beginning of a new dawn.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-23T01:17:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/cop29-reveals-itself-as-the-great-fraud-it-always-was/
David Keighley was right. Everything he warned about hate crime has come to pass,"IT WAS a full seven years ago on October 17, 2017, that David Keighley warned on these pages of the latest of Theresa May’s ‘victim’ obsessions – hate crime. Elevating hate crime was part of her Tory ‘detoxifying’ programme – aka her full-scale shift of the party (and the then Government) towards progressive left woke thinking and culture, an appeasement that her colleagues shamefully ‘sucked up’. Fromrace audits(into 130 aspects of life no less) to transgenderism, whichshe and her Equalities Ministers promoted, to hate crime, May pushed a poisonous rhetoric driven by the ideology of identity politics. Her Government’sNational Hate Crime Awareness Weekthat October, was a full-scale effort, David reported at the time. It involved the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups(many in receipt of government grants). Centre stage in that campaign, of course, was the BBC: ‘True to form’, David wrote, the BBC ‘produced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote, of course – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over on This Week,the BBC then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that “the white race” is “the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth”.’ But for an email from David responding to Janice Davis’s article, ‘What’s the real reason they are going after Allison Pearson?‘ on Wednesday, reminding me of it, I might have forgotten where this all began and who was responsible. Yes, it was a Conservative Government that facilitated the hate crime process as part of its then anti-Brexit propaganda manoeuvres. This was when the selective hate crime culture we are now locked in kicked off. Today, and once more with the full backing of the BBC, he noted, the Labour Government is intensifying its attack on dissenters from its Islamist/communist and DEI missions. In fact not a week passes without theBBC fuelling this dystopian cultureor encouragingso called ‘victims’ to press their complaintsin what can only be described as a targeted tyranny. As David said to me in his email, almost everything he warned about ‘has now come to pass in spades’. How right he is. And it should surely be obvious to all but the dimmest that although, as Suella Braverman says, ‘the subjective nature of non-crime hate incidents makes them unworkable‘, Labour’s Politburo simply doesn’t care. In fact the subjectivity and irrationality is the point. Hate crime can be targeted politically well suiting a Government determined to ‘crack down’ on ‘Islamophobia’. Any hope for Braverman’s attempt to rescind any of the hate crime legislation died with Labour’s return to power. Yvette Cooper in true Pol Pot style is only interested in policelogging hate crimes more efficiently, lumping anti-semitism with the artificialIslamophobiaconstruct as though they were morally and ontologically equivalent. They are not. Below is David’s spot-on,full original article.It should make salutary reading for former and current Tory voters. *** EYES and ears open, everyone, and anti-prejudice antennae out! It’snational hate crime awareness week. This is a full-scale effort, involving the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups, many of which are taxpayer-funded, to tell us that we are all miserable sinners. ‘Hate’ in this context covers such crimes generally – against the disabled, religions, different sexual orientations, and race – but the principal focus is on race because the bulk of such crimes (78 per cent, according to latest Home Office data) fall into this category. Centre stage in this campaign, of course, is the BBC. True to form, last week itproduced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over onThis Week, they then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that ‘the white race’ is ‘the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth’. Aiding the Corporation?Step forward Superintendent Paul Giannasi OBE, the National Hate Crimes Coordinator, who runs for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) the portal for reporting hate crime. No, he is not a secret member of UKIP. Rather,he is part of a Facebook group called ‘We Love Europe’, and boy, does he. Mr Giannasi believes that the Brexit vote was a change ‘unwanted and unexpected’, an ‘expression of the tyranny of democracy’ which was ‘caused by political arrogance, thirst for power, idiotic fears, prejudice, bigotry and incredible stupidity’. And let’s not forget the special contribution of Hillary Rodham Clinton. On a book-plug visit, she was given oodles of BBC airtime to reject Brexit. Nasty populist Nigel Farage, she claimed,duped the British people with the ‘big lie’about topics such as immigration – and then went on to sabotage her own election as US President. In fact the BBC declared war on Brexit, using race hate claims as a main weapon, over a year ago. It was among the most avid in reporting an alleged ‘spike’ in such offences after June 23 (of which more later) and thenwrongly claimed on August 31that the death of a Polish man in Harlow was a ‘frenzied’ murder triggered by post-Brexit race hate. The message from all the agencies involved is clear. Bigoted white people are smashing skulls, wreaking havoc, subverting the democratic process, and their populist prejudices against other nationalities and other races are forcing the UK to abandon globalism and leave the EU. But what is the truth about ‘race hate’? Everything about the way it is framed and reported should send alarm bells about the veracity of any figures involved. First, it’s almost certainly the easiest crime on the statute book to register because, uniquely, alleged incidents are recorded by the police on a self-report basis via their specially-established website,True Vision(run by Supt Giannasi). All a ‘victim’ has to do is register the ‘crime’ – and hey presto, it’s in the stats. At a time when –as theSunreported this week– police forces are working flat-out to limit ‘by hundreds of thousands’ the number of recorded burglaries, shop thefts, and even minor assault charges, they are simultaneously transferring their efforts to the ‘hate crime’ domain.The key supporters of the Stop Hate UK charity, for example, include a clutch of police forces. Second, the definition of a ‘hate crime’ is unusually loose. Such an offence is deemed to have been committed if the victim, or any witness of the incident, thinks they have been subjected to ‘hate’. This ease of reporting has been accompanied by a mushrooming of associated interest groups,spearheaded by the government’s primary service provider, Capita, and this has no doubt contributed to the rising volume of ‘race hate’ claims. This ‘increase’ was trumpeted yet again this week in theannual hate crime figuresreleased by the Home Office, up to the end of March. True to form, theBBC’s report of the statisticsis accompanied by a picture of one of the sinister-looking Pole-hating thugs it had trawled Britain to find for its specialPanoramaedition. These statistics show that there has indeed been a rise in recorded hate crime, from 62,518 in 2015-16 to 80,393 in 2016-17. But in the context of the lax self-report procedures, what does this prove? Does it reflect a rise in actual incidents? Or perhaps far more likely – in tandem with the vast amounts of money being spent in this arena, combined with publicity from the BBC, and the Remain faction generally – simply that there is increased awareness that such ‘crimes’ can be reported? Whatever the reason, Amber Rudd’s Home Office was keen to stress the alleged ‘spike’ in race attacks and crimes after June 23 last year because of the Brexit vote. But drill down deeper into the report, and it quickly emerges that this, too, must be treated with a great pinch of salt because it is, to quote the report, based only on ‘anecdotal evidence’. These figures fail another vital acid test. The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for bringing hate crimes to court andmade clear in its annual report, also published this week, that this is a major priority. What do the stats show? Well, in the last year – despite everything noted above – the number of hate crime prosecutions fell by almost 1,000 over the previous year to 14,480. In other words, the number of so-called hate crimes with sufficient evidence to go to court is in sharp decline, despite all the resources and efforts being expended. On that basis, of the 80,000 race hate ‘crimes’ reported toTrue Vision, only about 18 per cent will be tested in court. And the reaction?This BBC reportemphasises in great detail the rise in number of recorded ‘crimes’, does not enumerate the fall in prosecutions, and has a long sequence about a Muslim ‘victim’ who concludes: ‘I really think it’s important for us to report, no matter what.’ Of course.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-was-right-everything-he-warned-about-hate-crime-has-come-to-pass/
The climate scaremongers: BBC admits it lied about vanishing polar bears ,"IN AUGUST, the BBC published anews itemabout a Canadian worker killed by two polar bears. The article claimed: ‘There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government. The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.’ No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world’s population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973. The BBC have now formally upheld the complaint I submitted at the time, and have posted this on theirComplaints Page: Complaint A reader challenged a statement in this article which claimed that the global population of polar bears was in decline. The ECU [Executive Complaints Unit] considered whether it met the standards of due accuracy set out in the BBC Editorial Guidelines. Outcome The article reported on the death of a worker who was attacked by two polar bears in Canada’s northern Nunavut territory. It said such attacks are rare and continued as follows: ‘There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government. The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.’ Research carried out by the ECU confirmed scientists agree climate change will cause a reduction in sea ice, which is likely to have a long-term detrimental effect on polar bears and overall population numbers. There are also considerable challenges in obtaining reliable data. However evidence from the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Polar Bear specialist group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature appears to suggest numbers are stable overall at present and not in decline as stated. Upheld Further action The finding was reported to the Board of BBC News and discussed with the editorial team concerned. UK climate has changed little in recent years THE Global Warming Policy Foundation has just published my annual review of UK weather trends, based on official data. As in previous years, it finds no evidence that our weather is becoming more extreme, or that, as the Met Office recently claimed, ‘the UK’s climate continues to change’. The report’s findings include: • Following a rise in temperatures in the 1990s and early 2000s, average temperatures have barely increased since 2007. • A Met Office study in 2006 found strong evidence that this earlier rise was linked to increased sunshine, possibly the result of reduced air pollution thanks to the Clean Air Acts of the 1960s and 70s. (The report has since been buried). • The number of days with extreme temperatures has actually fallen since the 1970s, with fewer extreme cold days outnumbering more hot ones. • Average annual rainfall in England and Wales has increased since the 1960s, but is at similar levels to other periods pre-1960. • Summers are not becoming drier, as consistently projected by the Met Office. • Rainfall is not growing more extreme, whether on an annual, monthly or daily basis. • Sea levels around Britain are gradually rising at the same rate they were a century ago. • Wind storms have been declining in both frequency and intensity since the 1990s. Britain’s weather is notoriously volatile, and can change dramatically from year to year. Any underlying, long-term changes are dwarfed by natural variability. The full report can bedownloaded here. But it is worth taking a quick look at a few of the charts. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words! First, temperatures. We can see that temperatures have been rising since the 17th Century, long before ‘global warming’. It is also worth noting that winter has seen the biggest increase. In contrast summer temperatures have barely risen since the 1700s: Secondly, rainfall. As noted above, we are currently going through a wetter than average period, but no wetter than other periods, such as the 1870s and 1920s. The second chart also dispels the myth that rainfall is becoming more extreme. Finally, sea levels. We are constantly told that sea levels are rising so fast that cities will be under water by the end of the century. The actual data tell a different story. Around Britain’s coasts, seas have been rising at less than 2mm a year, just as they have been since the Little Ice Age ended in the late 19th century.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:15:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-bbc-admits-it-lied-about-vanishing-polar-bears/
A vaccine volunteer’s heartrending chronicle of a life destroyed,"A WOMAN who suffered a severe adverse reaction during Oxford- AstraZeneca’s covid vaccine trial was so badly injured that it was four months before she could walk again. Within an hour of receiving the jab she developed paraesthesia, an autoimmune condition that attacks the nerves. It left her in excruciating pain, unable to eat, and so sensitive to light and noise that she was confined to a darkened room with sunglasses and earplugs. A mother of two young children, Brianne Dressen, from Utah, USA, considered suicide to stop the pain, a common reaction in the vaccine-injured community. Her husband Dr Brian Dressen, who has a PhD in chemistry, and children Cooper and Hannah kept her going, although at one time even a cuddle from them was too painful. For months, Mrs Dressen, who received the trial vaccine in November 2020, could not bear anything moving near her or touching her body, and the children were instructed to stay out of the spare room where she spent her days and slept. Hannah came in one day, curled around her mother promising, ‘Mommy, I won’t speak. I’ll be less wiggly. Please let me lie here next to you. Just for a bit. I’ll be good. I miss you.’ Mrs Dressen was 39 then, a preschool teacher who ran her own nursery school. She had no choice but to text her husband to ask him to retrieve their daughter. Despite her best efforts, Hannah was too young to stay still, and her chatter felt like ‘a knife cutting through my brain; the feeling of her snuggling up to me was too much,’ Mrs Dressen said. Hannah was six when her mother was vaccine-injured, and her brother Cooper was eight. Now ten and 12, they no longer remember a time that their mother was not ill. Mrs Dressen, now 43, who is unable to work and permanently disabled, said: ‘This has been incredibly traumatic for them, and they wear my pain in their hearts. You can see it in their faces and hear it in the things they say. They try and be strong and happy for me and I try and be strong and happy for them, but it’s not easy. This time of year, they say, “Mom, I really want you to be better by Christmas.” Or “I think I’m done with you being sick, I’m ready for you to be better”.’ Before Oxford-AstraZeneca destroyed their lives the Dressen family were immersed in their close-knit community. When lockdowns hit, they focused on helping others cope with the grim isolation and fear, and spent hours painting animal faces on small rocks to cheer people up. Mrs Dressen said: ‘We would go around the neighbourhood and place the pet rocks somewhere on people’s front yards, ring doorbells and run away, smiling at the thought of our friends finding these cute little gifts.’ Before she was injured, Mrs Dressen was active and sporty. She hiked, snowboarded, swam, and climbed mountains with her husband, now 47. Her older sister, an obstetrician who was on the front line during covid, recounted a story which made Mrs Dressen determined to do her bit. A woman pregnant with twins was admitted to her hospital. She was miscarrying and haemorrhaging, with clots in her placenta caused by covid. While Mrs Dressen’s sister saved the mother, the premature twins were dying with no one to hold them. Most healthcare workers were told to stay home during the pandemic leaving only emergency cover. There was a frantic hunt to find any staff who could cuddle the twins as their lives ebbed away. This tragedy had a profound effect on Mrs Dressen, who had always believed in vaccination. When Facebook published a form asking for volunteers to test AstraZeneca’s new covid jab, she immediately applied. The form was simple and asked for her name, profession, location and contact details and she was invited to participate subject to health checks, which she passed. Later, Mrs Dressen joined thousands of the vaccine-injured in one of many Facebook support groups that popped up globally. The groups were lifelines for those struggling with injury and desperately seeking information for any effective treatment. In June 2021, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team deleted all but one of the groups after Senator Ron Johnson hosted a vaccine-injured press conference in Milwaukee, despite the fact Johnson made it clear in his opening remarks that all attendees were pro-vaccine. They had all taken the shots. Mrs Dressen developed more and more symptoms that doctors are unable to explain. Tinnitus accompanied by excruciating loud screeching. Insomnia. Nausea, worse than either of her two pregnancies. She lost control of her bladder and developed constipation. She struggled to eat and lost 20lb while her legs turned to jelly and she could barely walk. Her heart became erratic, alternating between slowing to an alarmingly low rate that made her feel faint, then speeding up in a way that had never happened while she was doing sports. Doctors were ‘baffled’. Electric shocks surged through her body causing constant unbearable pain. Most days, she felt she was being electrocuted from head to toe. Only strong painkillers such as benzodiazepines, gabapentin or pregabalins helped. But the medication made her completely incoherent. As a trial participant, Mrs Dressen was reassured that if anything went wrong, AstraZeneca – whose trial was suspended temporarily because of serious side effects – would provide full support and pay for any doctors’ bills. This is clearly written in the consent form and a reason she signed, despite misgivings. She was also told if she became ill, the study doctor and AstraZeneca would arrange treatment. AstraZeneca had an insurance policy that would cover all costs. Side effects were mostly referred to as ‘mild’ or ‘moderate’, with a few considered ‘severe’. Most appeared within 48 hours of the injection but resolved within seven days, she was told. A sore arm, chills, headache, and fatigue were common. Not so common was a decrease in infection-fighting and/or clot-forming blood cells, reactions acknowledged as having occurred. In the consent form Mrs Dressen read that in animal trials, monkeys developed antibody dependent enhancement, meaning that they had a worse covid infection post-vaccine, but the trial investigator who went through the consent form with her told her this had not been verified. Some serious ‘rare’ reactions were flagged; these included anaphylaxis, which trial staff were trained to handle, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Its symptoms were not listed but include muscle weakness and tingling in the limbs or upper body. GBS could lead to paralysis or death, she discovered. Mrs Dressen had not heard of GBS so assumed it was really rare, but it was something that made her hesitate. She planned to go home and think whether she really wanted to go ahead but at the trial centre in Salt Lake County, after taking her medical history and blood samples, she was told she could receive the experimental vaccination there and then. Despite feeling uneasy, Mrs Dressen thought it would be worth it if she could help prevent more people suffering like the poor mother who lost her twins. The purpose of the trial was never to see if the vaccine would prevent people catching covid, it was to check that they would not become dangerously ill with it. Mrs Dressen received her shot on November 4, 2020. By then, 5,000 people had received at least one dose, and 30 people had received a second. Her severe adverse reaction (SAE) began within the hour. The independent trial centre, 40 minutes from her home, which Mrs Dressen describes as shabby and run-down, acted as middleman between trial participants and AstraZeneca. She called them the morning after she was vaccinated and filled in her symptoms in an app they provided. For 48 hours she heard nothing back. They finally rang and told her a neurologist should check to see if she had any underlying conditions but they did not offer to pay. The neurologist found nothing. The trial centre alerted AstraZeneca who never contacted Mrs Dressen or offered any help, breaking the terms of their contract. The family quickly realised they were on their own and Dr Dressen began researching papers on vaccine injury to find answers and help for his wife. Despite 60 appointments with doctors, four visits to ER, and one hospital admission, all in year one, which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, AstraZeneca offered Mrs Dressen just $590 to cover her expenses, and that was only after her story broke in local media. When a national news story ran, she was offered a $1,250 payment that they said would absolve the company of any future liability. Mrs Dressen refused and, as she faces crippling medical bills for life, had no choice but to sue AstraZeneca for breach of contract. Because of America’s National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which indemnifies vaccine manufacturers, she was unable to claim injury compensation despite being diagnosed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with post-vaccine neuropathy. The Department of Health and Human Services run a taxpayer-funded vaccine injury compensation scheme which rejects around 98 per cent of all claims. Mrs Dressen has applied and says the calls she has had with them so far are already preparing her for rejection. In May 2024, she filed a lawsuit against AstraZeneca claiming breach of contract and failure to provide medical care. Mrs Dressen won this month but the company have appealed citing the 1986 Act, claiming no liability. Mrs Dressen has made some recovery but maintaining her health is a daily battle and she says her injury is progressive. ‘I taught myself acceptance therapy to deal with that,’ she said. Her message to Oxford University’s Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert, who co-developed the vaccine with the Oxford Vaccine Group and AstraZeneca, is: ‘I wish you could have been there when my life was ripped away from me, and I wish that you were there for the tens of thousands who came after me.’ AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment.

"Muslim rioters rampage with police blessing: Today Amsterdam, tomorrow Britain?","ISRAEL is on the front line in the fight against the Islamists. But now we share that front line. The Islamists go first for the Saturday people and then the Sunday people. The violent organised mass attack by Muslims –mostly Moroccans with an admixture of assorted non-Moroccan Arabs as well as Turks– against Jewish and Israeli fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv football club in Amsterdam two weeks ago is another expression of the anti-Israel/anti-Semitic sentiment infecting our own country, using the Israel/Palestine issue as the ‘acceptable’ excuse for anti-Semitic hatred and rage. So too was the weekend’s violent Palestinian protest in Montreal. Emboldened by the Canadian Prime Minister’s announcement that he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for alleged war crimes (therebysidingwith Iran and opposing the United States), the protesters descended intoviolence and anarchy, chanting for Israel’s demise, threatening a new Holocaust of Jews, and throwing Hitler salutes at bystanding Jews. It left Montreal’s Jewish community shaken and fearful for their safety; their leaders comparing it to historical anti-Semitic attacks. Amsterdamwas a planned attack, with rioters travelling from outside the city to join in. The full-scale violence began after the match, co-ordinated by Muslim taxi drivers who had mapped out the hotels where the Maccabi supporters were staying, and gave a running commentary on the locations of the Maccabi supporters during the attacks. There arereports of police collusion and participation in the attacks. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is a former Dutch politician, has talked about the takeover of Amsterdam’s internal security apparatus: ‘Today, a large part of the Amsterdam police force is made up of second-generation migrants from North Africa and the Middle East.’ One of the fans who was attacked said: ‘The Dutch chief of police says officers are human being[s] and they can enforce the law however they want. He gave a legal right to the police not to protect us.’ Regarding the Muslim attackers, he added: ‘They want to apply the Sharia law all over Europe.They will kill us, you, everyone. We know this, and Europe needs to as well.’ The Israeli government sent planes to the Netherlands to take Israeli citizens home. Local Jews organised transport to the airport as taxis were not deemed safe for Israelis. Around the same time as the Amsterdam attacks, Belgian police arrested six suspects who were allegedly planning an Amsterdam-inspired ‘Jew hunt’ in Antwerp, andteenagers in a Jewish youth football team were attacked by a knife-wielding pro-Palestine mob in Berlin– ‘hunted down’ by Arab youths. The Berlin police chief hasadmitted Berlin is not safe for ‘openly gay’ or Jewish people: ‘Unfortunately, there are certain neighbourhoods where the majority of people are of Arab descent, who also have sympathies for terrorist groups.’ How many police chiefs in the UK would openly admit to such ‘no-go’ zones here, or that dozens of Sharia courts are allowed to operate freely and give out ‘Islamic’ judgments to Muslims living in UK communities? Internationally, inflammatory pronouncements such as that from UNICEF that the Israeli UNRWA ban ‘means a new way has been found to kill children’, or the announcement thatCanada is reaching out to ‘allies’ in its quest to recognise a Palestinian state, can only give further encouragement to jihadists.The UN has voted to stop Israel defending certain parts of its own territory,and to force it to withdraw entirely from key areas that serve to make its country defendable against its enemies and direct attack. The thinking appears to be that Israel should not be allowed to fight back. Perversely October 7 was the trigger that released this new anti-Semitic onslaught against all Jewry, and all those who stand in defence of Israel and its legitimate place in history, in what must be one of the most egregious act of victim-blaming in history. In March this year I wrote:‘How much longer will it be before I will need to go to Israel to look a Jew in the eye, because there are none left in the UK?’As the year has progressed, I have seen nothing to change that view. Indeed, after the installation of the Labour government of Two-Tier Keir Starmer and election of several independent Muslim Vote MPs, my fear increased. Now, with the Prime Minister Starmer’s shocking backing for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli PM Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, it has doubled. It can but give direct encouragement to Hamas in particular and Islamist ambitions in general. UK politicians have also given credence to the lie that Israel is now the unwarranted aggressor in its conflict with Hamas,recently voting at the UN Security Councilto impose a ceasefire on Israel (vetoed by the US) with no dependent clause for Hamas to release the hostages it kidnapped on October 7. This is despite clear evidence that theformer head of UNRWA repeatedly met and expressed unity with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders and let them influence UNRWA operations; that UNRWA employees took part in the October 7 atrocities; and despite that Hamas-originatedinflated casualty numbers and Israel deliberately starving Gazansare based onon liesand propaganda – in a word, faked. What happened in Amsterdam on November 7 and in Montreal this weekend is a warning of what could come to Britain in the not-too-distant future. Is this what we want in this country? Do we stand aside as Israel-haters continue to pack our streets, populate social media with anti-Semitic and hate-inciting bile, and whose representatives sit in Parliament and local councils and undermine police neutrality? At the start of the Second World War the Dutch Jewish population was around 150,000. Three-quarters of them were murdered in Hitler’s extermination programme. The current core Jewish population is 30,000. The new Nazis of fashionable anti-Semitism – the fundamental Islamists in our midst, the woke, the intellectually deceived, and the purely ignorant – act as though they would like to continue the work of 1930s and 1940s Nazis across Europe and in the UK. For UK and European Jews, surely all roads must now lead to Israel. But where do the rest of us go, once the Saturday people have departed, and it’s the turn of the Sunday people?",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/muslim-rioters-rampage-with-police-blessing-today-amsterdam-tomorrow-britain/
"A warning shot writ large, but Putin won't attack the West","After a long period of steady grind, the tempo of the war in Ukraine has turned up several notches over the past week. Russian advances have continued in the Donbass, and the salient in the Kursk region (the 250 -square-mile area anchored by the town of Sudzha), as I predicted inmy last article, is being slowly but surely strangled. Ukrainehas lost more than 40 per cent of the territory it seized in Russia’s Kursk region, France 24 reported on Saturday. The hot news, however, is the granting of permission by Britain for the use of ATACMS long-range missiles, which itself requires US permission because of access to targeting systems, and by the US for the use ofStorm Shadows. Why has this come about now? I suggest three main reasons. First, the Biden administration is trying its best to queer Donald Trump’s pitch by so irritating the Russians that any diplomatic intervention after January will fail. Secondly, and perhaps I am giving more credit than is deserved, there is a desire to shape a future peace deal by halting Ukraine’s slow defeat and putting Zelensky in a viable negotiating position. Third, from the point of view of Sir Keir Starmer, he is simply obeying his masters in the EU Commission and the WEF who for years have been desperate for a war with Russia, since the Russians despise them and all their works. Russia’s response was the launch of anOreshnik (‘Hazel’) intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)on the town of Dnipro. (This has been wrongly reported as an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it is not.) The missile has aspeed above Mach 10, making interception difficult, and is capable of carrying a nuclear payload. Because of this, the standard procedures were activated through the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center,by the Russians, 30 minutes before the launch to warn the US and NATO. There must have been something of a frisson for a minute or two when this was received because of its nuclear capability, but this was soon allayed when Dnipro failed to disappear in a mushroom cloud. Instead of a nuke, the missile was armed with multiple conventional warheads – six warheads each with six sub-munitions – capable of causing considerable but not catastrophic damage. It was, therefore, a warning shot writ very large. If the Ukrainians employ long-range weapons, it must expect that the same weapons will be used against them. What was behind this response? Putin knows, of course, that come January and the inauguration of President Trump the scenery will shift but before that, the Democrats and Starmer will do all they can to increase tensions. All he has to do is wait them out. However, there is bound to have been internal pressure on him to remind the West just who they are dealing with. The attack was followed by an announcement thatlarge-scale production of the missile will go ahead. Of course, one might say with some justification that Putin cannot really complain about foreign equipment being used against him by his enemy, when he is using Chinese, Iranian and North Korean equipment – and manpower. For this reason, as well as the need to wait Biden out, it is most unlikely that the Russians would attack US or British units and personnel on the ground – and they are there in Ukraine right now. Nor will any attack be launched against Nato territory unless Nato or one of its members initiated an attack. Nor is a first-use nuclear attack at all likely. Putin does not need to do this and in any case, why raise the stakes that high when you are winning? So, does this mean, as some writers are claiming, that the West is on a path which will inevitably lead to war with Russia? I would suggest not. First, history tells us that there is no such thing as inevitability. Secondly, no direct action can take place without US involvement. This will not happen. Biden does not control Congress, whose support he would need for such a move. More importantly, the Joint Chiefs’ principles, laid down at the start of hostilities, remain in place: that the war would be confined to the territory of Ukraine, that Ukraine would be given all material support required to defend itself, that the cohesion of Nato would be maintained and that there would be no direct US or Nato intervention. Added to this is the undoubted fact that public opinion throughout the West has shifted towards the need to end the war, in spite of what warmongers at governmental level may say. This extends to some governments too –in particular Hungary. The final improbability is that, aside from the US, no Nato nation is in a position to take the field against Russia with more than a few battalion-group sized battlegroups. Consider our own country: the Army is down to 85,000 regulars – probably fewer than that – of whom only about one-third are combat troops. The front-line tank fleet is a mere 140, the Warrior upgrade has been abandoned, the field artillery belongs on the Antiques Roadshow and air defence is absent. Logistic stocks have been denuded by supplying Ukraine and not replenished. Collective training standards are low and the vehicle fleet is in bad shape because of the lunatic programme of ‘whole fleet management’. The RAF is down to 12 combat squadrons. No doubt many officers and soldiers would do their best, but the remarks byRob Magowan, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, that if the British Army ‘was asked to fight tonight, it would fight tonight’are both untrue and disloyal – untrue because thefacts speak against him, and because the Secretary of State for Defence has already made the position clear; and disloyal because if he had the best interests of the country at heart, he would be telling politicians in no uncertain terms that their neglect over decades has brought the defence of our country to its knees.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-warning-shot-writ-large-but-putin-wont-attack-the-west/
My choice as world leader of the century? Netanyahu,"NOW THAT we are nearly a quarter of the way through the 21stcentury, it is interesting to speculate on who is the best world leader so far. With the advantage of hindsight, we can clearly recognise the great world leaders of the last century. In no particular order my list would include Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt, Konrad Adenauer, Yoshida Shigeru, Charles de Gaulle, Lee Kuan Yew, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. These are the figures who put the world together again after the ravages of world war and socialism. Now for the runners and riders for my vote for best world leader of the 21stcentury. But first, a quick comment on the utterly useless. Some heralded Angela Merkel as an ‘Iron’ lady with a handbag – a woman in the Thatcher mould. There was no handbag. Instead, she carried a stiletto with which to knife her political rivals. An ace at political manoeuvre, Merkel’s energy and immigration policies have led to Germany’s current economic and social demoralisation. President Barack Obama was the standard-bearer of an evil totalitarian woke cult which has swept the world over the last decade. Instead of using his office to heal racial divisions, he stirred them up by provably false accusations of institutional racism. As a result, the corrupt and divisive Black Lives Matter movement was set in motion. Obama’s equally ghastly woke apostles were New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Canada’s Justin Trudeau. Obama also aligned himself with the globalist interests of corporate America in taking a ‘just-get-over-it’ attitude to the workers of middle America. His foreign policy failures included a soft, ‘kick-the-can-down-the-road’ sort of nuclear deal with Iran. In Asia Obama was asleep at the wheel in failing to push back China’s military takeover of the South China Sea. All the while Obama and his wife Michelle exuded a repellent, narcissistic moral superiority. Xi Jinping also makes the bad leader list. Having established a personalisation of power not seen since Mao Zedong, Xi’s overly aggressive and ham-fisted attempt to bend Southeast Asia to his will in taking over the South China Sea as well as his bullying behaviour towards Taiwan has alienated the world. If Chinese leadership has been downright bad, the leaders of France have simply disappointed. Both Nicolas Sarkozy and Emmanuel Macron rode into office with pledges to reform the bloated state apparatus. They both failed utterly. Between their presidencies, Francois Hollande, the unlikely lothario, proved to be an inept windbag. But neither has British leadership got much to boast about. Prime Minister Tony Blair left a legacy of fake dossiers on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction which he used to justify what turned out to be a disastrous intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. His successor, Gordon Brown, gave every appearance of being a paranoid sociopath, and spent so much government funding in a failed attempt to get himself re-elected that his Chief Secretary to the Treasury left a note for his successor saying, ‘I’m afraid there is no money’. David Cameron ran away from his duty to implement the result of the referendum that he called on membership of the European Union. Sadly, thereafter the Conservative Party elected a trio of inept leaders: Theresa May, an overpromoted nonentity, Boris Johnson, a brilliant campaigner who was, as one of his many mistresses said to me recently, ‘completely unsuited to be a prime minister’, and Liz Truss, an inflexible monomaniac who self-destructed within days of taking office. So, who does that leave to claim the mantle of being the 21stcentury’s greatest leader? Narendra Modi would be on my shortlist. He is halfway toward a restructuring of an Indian economy that was built on the socialist legacy of Nehru’s Congress Party. Donald Trump’s current legacy is similarly half finished. Leaving aside his economic reforms, a highlight was the Abraham Accords, a reconciliation of Israel with the Arab states; it was a diplomatic triumph for which any other president would have won the Nobel Peace Prize. Viktor Orban is another leader of note; he has brilliantly developed his country’s economy and refused to kowtow to the socialist euro-elite. Judging by his performance in Davos, where he denounced the globalist elite to its face, Argentine president Javier Milei may well become South America’s Orban. Collectively the leaders of Switzerland, largely faceless to the world’s media, deserve recognition for running the most democratic and best managed country in Europe. However, my prize for world leader of the 21stcentury must go to Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, Israel’s leader for 16 of the last 27 years. This may come as a surprise to some, given the pervasive opprobrium that is heaped upon him by the liberal global media. Donald Trump apart, he is arguably the most reviled leader of his generation. Some of the criticism may be fair. He is arrogant, self-serving and narcissistic – typical political characteristics. Above all he is anti-left and anti-Palestinian, qualities that are inimical to a Western, and indeed Jewish, liberal elite which despises him. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, head of investment bank NM Rothschild, referred to him as ‘that appalling man’. Over the last few years Netanyahu has attracted further opprobrium by his government’s attempt to bring to heel a Supreme Court which, since the presidency of Aharon Barak in the 1990s, has become increasingly leftist and politicised, granting to itself the power to cancel laws and putting itself above the sovereignty of the elected Knesset. Netanyahu has also been heavily criticised for the failure of Israeli security to prevent Hamas’s gruesome attack on October 7. But surely opposition figures such as Benny Gantz or Naftali Bennett would have been similarly blindsided? It should be noted that nobody called for the resignation of F D Roosevelt after the failure of US intelligence in preventing Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Now let’s look at Netanyahu’s greatest success, one that is almost entirely overlooked by western media. More than anyone Netanyahu is responsible for Israel’s economic miracle which has made his country the world’s 13thwealthiest: GDP per capita has increased from US$17,000 to $58,200 since 2003. When Netanyahu became prime minister for the first time in 1996, Israel was a sclerotic socialist economy. In 2003 the public sector accounted for half of Israel’s GDP. This was anathema to Bibi who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology then worked for Boston Consulting Group. Apart from learning capitalism first-hand in the US, he took on board the libertarian values of Ayn Rand after reading her seminal novelThe Fountainheadon the recommendation of Yoni, his older brother. (Yoni Netanyahu was later killed by Palestinian terrorists while leading Israel’s special forces to liberate Jewish hostages at Entebbe Airport.) Taking a leaf out of Margaret Thatcher’s book, Netanyahu deregulated Israel’s foreign exchange controls which limited citizens to taking just $7,000 out of the country. To the shock of leftist economists, there was no capital flight. Instead, a floating exchange rate brought international funds flooding into Israel. There followed a highly successful privatisation programme, budgetary discipline and tax cuts. The government budget was curtailed, but not at the expense of infrastructure investment. This included a programme to increase the number of science and maths graduates by 50 per cent, laying the foundation for Tel Aviv to become the world’s third-most important tech hub. Netanyahu’s most important contribution to global leadership has been not in the realm of economics but global security. More than any other world leader he has stood steadfast in refusal to countenance a Palestinian state, whose component parts are currently run by terrorist groups, Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Neither of these groups will ever accept Israel’s existence. Netanyahu has always recognised that a two-state solution would exacerbate, not resolve, the region’s instability. The October 7 massacre of Jews demonstrated the accuracy of his understanding of the real nature of Hamas – an unreformable Jihadi death cult that is a menace not only to Israel but also the world. We should therefore be grateful for Netanyahu’s determination to destroy Hamas. Its demise would be a defeat for global Jihadism as important as the eradication of Al Qaeda and Isis. Failure would simply encourage a global Jihadist movement which is already embedded and emboldened in many Western countries. Netanyahu’s steadfast leadership in countering Palestinian terrorism is a beacon of hope in the world’s worst neighbourhood. This alone should win him our vote as the greatest world leader of his generation.

"Badenoch should listen to Clarkson, and learn","AT AN awards ceremony in 2004, Jeremy Clarkson decided to punch Piers Morgan in the head. We cannot say that this was Clarkson’s finest hour for the simple reason that he went one better and hit him again. As is the way of the English, the two subsequently became good friends. I mention this partly because it’s funny, partly in tribute to the recently departed street pugilistJohn Prescott,and partly because, as Mike Graham points out, Clarkson is a man this government really does not want to take on. Clarkson is a man whose talents go beyond the ability to handle himself. One of these is an ability bordering on genius to identify and trigger that class of people we call ‘perennially irritating’. He was working that magic again last week when he put in a bravura performance at the farmers’ rally. This took place in what used to be London. Clarkson brilliantly gave voice to the anxieties of farmers over the government’s announcement that Starmer’s commitment to agricultural exceptionalism was just something you say to groups of farmers before a general election. And what he really meant to say was that when in office he would dump on the farming community by scrapping Agricultural Property Relief. The BBC, and other representatives of the rentierlatteclasses were typically (and one suspects synthetically) outraged that a celebrity farmer should use his celebrity to talk about, well, farming. The usual suspects said their usual things and accused Clarkson of being a ‘tax dodger’ – as if that is a bad thing to be in a country where the government is as obnoxiously rapacious as the current shower. Now, doubtless only the necromancers who practise the dark arts of predictive economics are sufficiently well placed to spreadsheet the consequences of government reform in this area. And like Rachel Reeves, I am no economist. But the issues raised by this latest Treasuryvolte faceare not so much economic as moral,and any discussion of them must therefore range beyond the specific case of farming. A last testament is a bridge which links the dead to the living. It is a codified recognition of intergenerational affections and obligations. It is one of the practical requirements for Edmund Burke’s stable social order in which contracts exist not only between people who are here now but extend backwards in time to those who were here once and forward to those who are yet to be. It is improper for Rachel Reeves, or her possibly imminent successor, to act the part of troll on the farther side of that bridge, ready to shake down the beneficiaries of that legally formalised private intention. Inheritance tax is morally obnoxious whenever it is enforced. The government’s current embarrassment results from a failure to predict that farmers would be especially sensitive to this injustice. These are creative and intellectually nimble people, remember, and are wise to the hamfisted and ignorant intrusions of the state, irritations invariably effected by politicians who assume that what appears on their dinner plate is createdex nihiloby those wonderful people at Waitrose. Sir Roger Scruton was of less combustible temperament than Jeremy Clarkson, but like him he came to farming relatively late, having bought a smallholding in Wiltshire (not far from where I write this). Scruton was an activist as well as a thinker, and from this rural base he wrote of the need for conservatism, and its representative writers and defenders, to recapture a ‘spirit of place’; to affirm (in the language of David Goodhart) that it might be better to be a resident ofsomewherethan a citizen ofanywhere. My friend, the philosopher Ferenc Horcher, writing about Scruton’s conservatism remarks that: ‘[Scruton] claims that politics as we know it depends on settlement, admitting the need of human beings to be connected to a place and an appreciation of the customs of that place and its inhabitants.’ * Conservatism speaks to this need for settlement, or at least it ought to. And philosophers of conservatism should be sympathetic to the tradition of farming and reinsert it as an essential reference point in the conservative case. To farm a piece of land is actively to reassert a commitment tothis territory. Farming places value in neighbourliness, valorises family, and encourages an unsentimental and therefore genuine attitude towards domestic, working and other animals. It inculcates a realistic respect for our environment (without resorting to the Gaia idolatry of the net zero fanatics) and acknowledges thatthis placeis a gift which needs stewardship and therefore conservation. The farmer is attuned to seasonality and the cycles of the earth and therefore sees time and its passing through a lens which makes the ‘deadlines’ of politicians appear ridiculous. Just before she became this year’s Leader of the Opposition, Kemi Badenoch wrote the preface to a pamphlet outlining a way forward for her unhappy party. The document is detailed in terms of policy, or as detailed as could be expected following her party’s recent reversals. I suggest she ditches it. Her job is not to persuade the electorate with policy proposals. It is to capture its imagination with an idea. That idea should be the prosecution of the environmental case, as exemplified by the plight of our farmers. Conservatives need to reclaim the argument when it comes to conservation, to promote the local over the global, and to revivify Scruton’s ‘spirit of place’. The case for the environment should be removed from those whom Danny Kruger refers to as ‘climate eschatologists’, and brought back home to where it belongs: at the centre of conservative philosophy. Such is my unsolicited advice for Mrs Badenoch: political success is usually found in the articulation and repetition of a simple vision, one which enlists the sympathies of the least loud yet most wise. The last week has given her an opportunity to bring back genuine conservatism, because the traditions of the farm are active instantiations of conservative values, properly described. She could even count on the unwitting support of Ed Miliband, whose vindictiveness if fully implemented will see us back in the Dark Ages, but without the good bits. *See Ferenc Horcher’s excellentArt and Politics in Roger Scruton’s Conservative Philosophy.Scruton’s account of setting up his farm is the subject of his intellectual memoirNews from Somewhere.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-25T01:20:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/badenoch-should-listen-to-clarkson-and-learn/
The farm raid that mobilised Amish behind Bad Orange Man,"The catastrophic failure of the Democrats in the recent USA election which resulted in the triumph of the Bad Orange Man has had a fallout of comic proportions. Many conservatives have been metaphorically ‘bathing in liberal tears’ as the realisation hits the wokerati that what was unimaginable has happened. Social media has been full of progressive women shaving their heads and wearing blue bracelets in order to identify the ideologically pure with whom they can sit and commiserate now that they have entered into the realms of ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’. Some have gone so far as to swear off sex for the next four years, which at least has the upside that there might be fewer abortions. It is entertaining to speculate on the emotional wellbeing of all the Hollywood celebrities who are waking up to the harsh reality that ordinary Americans don’t care about their political opinions and have rejected their electoral advice and instructions, for which it emerges the Harris campaign paid them handsomely. Questions are being asked about when all the celebrities who vowed they were going to leave the USA in the event of a Trump victory are actually going to up sticks. That one has an easy answer. Never. They will still be around in 2028 when it will be J D Vance’s turn to usher in the right-wing apocalypse which will destroy democracy, instal a dictatorship and force them to leave the USA. Of more interest are the reasons being given for the Trump victory. Voting patterns are being assessed and fault apportioned. It seems that Black men in large numbers have voted against their own best interests, as have Latinos, Indians and even Native Americans. Minority groups have seen a swing towards Republicans and away from woke. Who would have thought that labelling Republicans as white supremacists, Nazis, fascists and Trump as ‘literally Hitler’ would have no effect whatsoever? Progressives are scratching their heads and muttering, ‘They’re not doing what we tell them to do. It’s almost as though these people believe they can think for themselves.’ Prior to the electionPew Research Centrefound that 82% of white evangelical Protestants, 61% of white Catholics and 58% of white non-evangelical Protestants backed Trump, while Harris was backed by 86% of Black Protestants, 85% of atheists, 78% of agnostics, 65% of Hispanic Catholics and 65% of Jewish voters. Although it is early to say it would appear that this is what happened on 5thNovember. Progressives know why white male evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Trump. It’s nothing to do with the economy or the woke insanity distorting American life: it’s obviously because they are racist, misogynist white supremacists who could never bring themselves to vote for a woman of colour. If white female evangelicals voted for Trump it indicates they have been conditioned by the patriarchy to vote against their own best interests. In all the hullabaloo over election analysis and attempting to find reasons for defeat other than the fact that Harris and Walz were terrible candidates, there is one group who have slipped below the radar, the Amish. The Amish are a conservative Anabaptist Christian community who have resolutely turned their back on modern technology. They are renowned for their self-sufficiency, the simplicity of their lifestyle, and plain dress. They much prefer face-to-face communication to telephones and don’t use television, preferring to spend time together as a family. Fleeing persecution in 18thcentury Europe, they arrived in the New World where William Penn offered them refuge in Pennsylvania. Due to their work ethic and emphasis on family ties the community boomed over the years. It is estimated that of the 400,000 Amish in America 92,000 live in Pennsylvania. The largest of the swing states with 19 votes in the electoral college, after going Democrat in 2020, it swung Trump’s way 2024. It was not the Amish vote which pushed Trump over the line, but it exemplifies why many did vote for Trump. The Amish like to keep themselves to themselves and their political involvement is usually minimal. Their stance changed this year largely due to a government raid on the Bird-in-Hand farm of Amish farmer Amos Miller. Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture found that Miller didn’t have a permit to sell milk in the state, despite the fact that he and his family had been selling milk for generations. Agents from the Department of Agriculture raided his farm and seized much of his food and dairy products. In the ensuing case, Miller was banned from selling milk in Pennsylvania, with the case ongoing. The case was seen by the Amish community as government tyranny and helped mobilise them against the party of Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat. The Republicans grasped their opportunity and initiated a serious registration drive, the first in Amish history, and the Amish responded by voting for Trump in‘unprecedented numbers’. What was viewed as an overzealous government was rejected by the Amish who responded by voting for Donald Trump, whose Republican party favours less government intervention in the life of the people. ‘That was the impetus for them to say, “We need to participate”,’ a source said of Amish voters. ‘This is about neighbours helping neighbours.’ The Amish are people of high moral principle, who value family life and who view gambling as a sin. Yet they voted for the much-married, casino-owning Donald Trump. They are not hypocrites, they are simply people who want to get on with their own lives without being badgered by an overweening government which thinks it knows best about everything. For the Democrats, as other progressives, it is all about control. From pronouns, DEI, required quotas, to mandatory speech and enforced gender ideology, Democrats demand the right to control what people say and do. Let us hope they and other progressives have learned that ordinary people do not like to be controlled by power hungry ideologues and they will rebel, even Christians.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-17T01:17:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/you-must-be-bad-if-even-the-amish-are-up-in-arms/
Anatomy of Trump’s triumph,"GO on, admit it. Don’t be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of November 5-6? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump’s 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost thepopular votein 2016 by three million votes (two per cent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four per cent). This time he won the popular vote bythree million(76-73) and two per cent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a ‘beautiful,’ ‘historical realignment’ in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In anNBC exit poll, Trump won 57 per cent of white and 55 per cent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In anAP exit poll, he won 20 per cent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris’s 80 per cent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden’s four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 per cent of Latinos, 39 per cent of Asian-Americans, 54 per cent of ‘Other,’ 45 per cent of women, and 43 per cent of 18–to-29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump’s success in creating a multi-ethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in anAP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases such as the Latino, black or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing inThe Globe and Mailin reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as ‘manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself’. His take on the outcome? ‘Sometimes the people get it wrong.’ He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that ‘this election was not an indictment’ of Harris but ‘an indictment of America.’ At least oneGuardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the ‘simple, inescapable message’ from Trump’s victory is that ‘many people despise the left’ with progressives seen as ‘one judgmental, “woke” mass.’ Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that ‘America is the greatest country in the world’ where ‘most people can make it if they work hard,’ again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump’s 14-point advantage amongvoters without college degreesflips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 per cent of Americans admitted to havingskipped mealsto keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on November 4. At his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: ‘We don’t need a star because we have policy.’ She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was ‘I am not Trump. I am not Biden.’ This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. EvenTaylor Swift’s hometownof Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in theWall Street Journal, it was ‘a landslide against the media’ (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the ‘quadfecta’ of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy inSeinfeld,some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year’s Voice referendum in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris’s massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they’d become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big ‘FU’ in return, just like with the Voice down under. There isn’t just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn’t one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to aForbes analysis, Harris’s six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 per cent Latino population which hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and which Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 per cent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, theneedle moved 20 points towards Trumpfrom 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian’s off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, whichBidencarried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris’s appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN’sexit pollshows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump’s new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women’s rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. TheCNN exit pollconfirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They also object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are racked with guilt over historical sins such as slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden’s cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris’s fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they’ve returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris’s concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world’s diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump’s efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris’ watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showedimmigration and the economyas the voters’ top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 per cent support. The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don’t subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don’t believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don’t support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don’t obsess over personal pronouns, and don’t lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump’s disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people’s concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump’s counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year,69 per centof Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trumpgained three points from both. How could this be: Isn’t he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and ‘My Body, My Choice’ with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck downRoe v Wadein June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 per centjump from 625,978 in 2021before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and thehighest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don’t feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn’t align with the joy vibe and there’s something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don’t back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it’s a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpetedgender gap worked to Trump’s net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn’t even excite the young. About 39 per cent of young women and 42 per cent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 per cent and 8 per cent picked abortion. Trump won 40 per cent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden’s margin by 19 points. He won amongunder-30men by 14 per cent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent$175million on TV adsacross the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent$123millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: ‘Kamala’s For They/Them. President Trump is for you’ was exceptionally effective. TheNew York Timesreported on November 7 on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by astunning 2.7 per centtowards Trump. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia’s critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups’ sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. At a function in Mumbai on November 10, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister SJaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that ‘a lot of countries are nervous about the US . . . We are not one of them.’ He said that Modi’s call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India’s global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are5.2million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It’s worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 per cent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 per cent for Biden in 2020. Harris’s share fell again to 60 per cent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 per cent, up from 22 in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation’s elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump’s Republican Party offer important clues on Trump’s appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

The billions upon billions wasted on useless face masks,"IN A RECENTtweet, Reform MP Rupert Lowe said: ‘I’ve been digging around. How much PPE (personal protective equipment), paid for by the taxpayer, has been destroyed? 1,049,700 pallets, which cost us £8.644billion . . . so grim.’ Grim indeed, Mr Lowe. The Labour Party’s disastrous recent Budget was predicated on the need to fill a ‘£22billion black hole’. It’s a shame such hard-nosed fiscal prudence was not on display during the covid saga, when the same Labour Party egged on the obscene squandering of resources with all the restraint of a drunken sailor. We know that somewhere in the region of £400billion of UK taxpayer money has been spent on ‘combating’ Covid-19, a figure that, according to a piece published by the BBC in March 2022, equates to roughly£6,000 per person. We also know that of this eye-watering figure, huge sums have been wasted through incompetence, sharp practice and fraud. Regarding the latter, a year into the ‘crisis’ theBMJwere reporting that one in five government contracts had signs of possiblecorruptionand Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferies’s detailed analysis across all categories of government covid-related spending concluded that about 10 per cent of the total was outrightfraudulent. That’s around £40billion, almost double the Chancellor’s supposed ‘black hole’. But on top of this tale of inefficiency, hasty action, backhanded deals given to politicians’ mates and criminal activity, one aspect of the sorry mess has yet to receive sufficient attention. That is the amount of money spent on precautions that were completely unnecessary: on measures that didn’t – and don’t – work, principal amongst which was the use of face masks as part of personal protection. In early April 2020 the UK Government and devolved administrations were in a tizzy. Previous pandemic planning had been binned and an entirely new strategy was being spun. As a result, politicians, their advisers and civil servants were in the grip of a frenetic process to develop guidelines for PPE. ThesePPE guidelinesfocused on the protection of workers in the health and social care sectors. Given that for other workers and settings there was, according to information in the Government’s possession, ‘very little scientific evidence of widespread benefit from PPE’, this didn’t make sense. But when did anything that happened during the time of coronamania add up? So official ‘guidance’ was that, within health and social care settings, masks and other PPE worked and were necessary; while in all other places ‘good hand hygiene and social distancing’ was considered sufficient. Illogical and ridiculous or not, politicians were determined to find PPE for so-called ‘front-line workers’. Unfortunately, despite being warned in2016of a need for active management, the PPE stockpile set up in 2009 was short of the ‘life-saving [sic] FFP3 respirator masks’, with more than two-thirds of the 33million stored items beingunaccounted for. By the start of May 2020, scrambling to cover their failures in planning and to neutralise thenegative PRthey were receiving, ministers and health officials and panjandrums had set up a centralised PPE procurementsystemwhich looked like this: The PPE procurementprocess Looking at this diagram, an observer is struck by at least two things: first, the apparent simplicity of the new procurement design; second, the designers’ supposed belief that something as sprawling and complex as the entire health and social care organisation supply and fulfilment system in the UK could be boiled down to a schema that fits a single page. One is left asking the obvious question that, if, during a supposed global health crisis of previously unencountered, and deadly, proportions, it would be possible to centralise NHS procurement this easily, and in the shortest of timeframes, why had it never been done before? Of course, the answer is that, as with many plans to change byzantine and deeply engrained systems, it isn’t as easy to do in practice as it looks in theory. What seemed smart to politicians, civil servants and their highly paidconsultantswhen viewed on a whiteboard in Downing Street didn’t hold as much water when implemented in the real world. While the new system worked, after a fashion, there were numerous examples of where it fell flat on its face, the most obvious strategic flaw in the system being that by acting in a panic and forcing all buying through a single funnel, the cost of PPE wasinflatedhugely. In these circumstances, even the supine state-controlled media have been able to spot the egregious wastage resulting from poor procurement practices, for examplehere,hereandhere. Additionally, the National Audit Office’s (NAO) ‘Investigation into the management of PPE contracts’ report,publishedearlier this year, identified many areas of concern, concluding by quoting the Department of Health and Social Care which had said it ‘expects fraud and error to be between 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent of PPE expenditure’ and that it continues to manage an estimated contract risk of £2.7billion. And what of face masks specifically? In line with the general theme of bureaucratic fumbling and ineptitude, we’ve seen exampleshere,hereandhereof masks that, for a variety of reasons, were unusable. Further,knowingthat they do nothing useful to stop transmission and instead introduce additional harms means that we also know that every pound spent on them has been a wasted one, creating misery into the bargain. And a lot of masks were bought. As early as April 2020, when individual NHS Trusts were responsible for their own procurement, staff were getting through‘tens of millions’of masks every week. Overall, from the start of the pandemic, we know, courtesy of the NAO’s report, that in total 37.2billion masks, gowns, gloves and so forth were purchased at a cost of £14.6billion by government – of which, official sourcesconfirmed, only about half were distributed. It is difficult to specify exactly the proportion of that number which is made up by face coverings. What we do know, from the underlying data to be foundhere, is that the value of contracts awarded by government bodies for masks was at least £5billion in 2020 alone. This money, spent on the useless masks, would have funded the first-year salaries of at least 151,000 additional nurses, or given all existing nurses a 30 per cent bonus payment. Instead, the jump to assume that which was known not to have worked previously had undergone a magical transformation meant that this opportunity to reward those most affected ‘on the front lines’ went begging. Perhaps the political optics just didn’t look good enough? Would it be any different the next time a ‘global pandemic’ arises? If, when confronted by theevidenceagainst masking, theresponsesupplied by NHS England’s then Chief Nurse and national lead for infection control, Dame Ruth May, is anything to go by, probably not. We can expect more of the same. Which, given the spectacular growth of 223 per cent in the protective face maskmarketduring 2020 and the predicted future Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9 per cent over the next seven years, is perhaps not surprising. After all, who could turn down all that easily made ‘government’ money? Other problems with the system have been highlighted: first by NHS procurement heads who criticised supply-chainperformance; and second in an answer to a written parliamentary question which revealed that storing PPE was costing the taxpayer £770,000 perday! We should also mention Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone and her relationship and connections to a company, ‘PPE Medpro’, involved in supplying sub-standard PPE to the Government. In particular, interest in the press has focused on Mone’s role and rewards as ‘middle woman’ in the grubby affair. The matter, comprehensively and succinctly documentedhere, which centres on a £200million deal to supply gowns to the Department of Health and Social Care, first saw the light of day in 2020, and through a succession of denials followed by admissions evolved into a scandal which saw the Baroness step away from the House of Lords and given a restraining order freezing assets worth £75million. Now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency, the case shone a harsh light on the matter of the Government’s ‘VIP lane system’ which featured a fast-track email box which allowed MPs to send on offers of PPE from suppliers, but led to the government being criticised for giving preferential treatment to companies with political contacts. Another disgrace dates from June of this year and news that from a deal worth £1.78billion cut in 2020 for face masks, respirators, eye protection and aprons, 1.57billion items valued at £1.4billion will‘never be used’. Of these items, around 750million had already been burned, with another 825million likely to face the same fate. Unlike the stock purchased through the PPE Medpro deal, the PPE was considered viable, but simply ‘overpurchased’ by those tasked with procuring supplies. A former government procurement adviser quoted by the BBC revealingly explained that ‘I think the procurement people did what many of us would have done and slightly panicked to get the stuff in, or at least get the contracts in and hope the stuff arrived later’, adding in a moment of candour that ‘it was almost as though price didn’t matter’. So far as it is possible to know, as a result of this waste of money, no one has lost their job. This seems a good place to stop and weigh the two explanations as to how unaccountable civil servants and posturing politicians were able to pour billions of pounds of our cash down the PPE drain. Take your pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence? Or, just maybe, both.r pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence?

No chance for the ‘far right’ in Starmer’s left-wing justice system,"THE Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson gave an interview to theSunday Timeswhich was a very interesting read indeed. It started with his desire to get more rapists convicted. These alleged rapists were playing the system by pleading not guilty, and how very dare they do that. I thought we had a presumption of innocence here in the UK, but that is causing problems for the DPP. According to the article, ‘Suspected rapists are seeking to evade justice by deliberately pleading not guilty and waiting for victims to drop out of long-delayed trials, the country’s top prosecutor has warned. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said defendants were “taking advantage” of delays in the criminal justice system and “hoping that something will come up” to cause a case to collapse.’ The article continues: ‘Ten per cent of victims of rape and other serious sexual offences withdraw their support after charges have been brought, he said. Many more do so while police investigate their complaints. Typically, it can take two years to investigate a rape case and another two years to bring it to trial, Parkinson said. “I think that’s outrageous. We see too many victims — usually women — withdrawing their co-operation because of the delay and also because they don’t feel sufficiently supported”.’ A few things on this. First, and most obviously, everyone including those accused of rape has a right to plead not guilty and exercise the right to a trial by jury. I think it is bad form for the DPP to be out there implying that defendants who enter a not guilty plea and maintain that plea until trial are somehow trying to ‘evade justice’. Surely, it is justice, a trial by jury, that they seek and are entitled to. The DPP is disgracefully casting aspersions on defendants who have entered not guilty pleas to the very serious charge of rape and are awaiting trial as is their legal right. It is hardly the defendant’s fault that the criminal justice system has been so trashed, starting with New Labour and continuing with successive Tory administrations, that trials take so long to come to court. Some of these defendants will be remanded in custody until trial, so they suffer as much as the complainant. It is not their responsibility that ‘a record backlog of 71,000 cases are awaiting trial in the nation’s crown courts, up from 38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic’. Justice denied is another legacy of the ruinous lockdown. Secondly, and this should not need to be said to the DPP, perhaps the reason why complainants withdraw their evidence is because they are lying and they made a false allegation. It is for the jury to determine the truth – not the DPP who feels under pressure to raise the conviction rate for rape. With various improvements to the system, the DPP ‘hopes the moves will encourage suspects to plead guilty at their first court hearing, making them eligible for a reduced sentence’. In reality, even for those defendants who are guilty, what person would plead guilty to such a serious offence at the first opportunity even with a reduced sentence? If defendants are ‘taking advantage’ it is because successive governments have given them the advantage, due to treating barristers like trash, outrageous court delays and systemic underfunding. Such is the DPP’s dodgy view on rape trials. I tell you what group of people did plead guilty at the first opportunity, the Far-Right Thugs (herein after referred to as FRT). Stephen Parkinson was asked about this too. TheSunday Timessaid: ‘The biggest challenge faced by Parkinson in the past year has been the riots that engulfed Britain after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July.’ Parkinson denied that the response from the CPS, which led to more than 740 people being charged, was ‘draconian’. This was in some ways a national crisis. It was important to show people that if they committed criminal conduct, they would be dealt with swiftly and effectively, he said, adding that the majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty. How true this was. The majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty at the first opportunity in the magistrates’ court. And I have been asking myself just why this was the case. The grandfather Peter Lynch who committed suicide in prison should not have pleaded guilty to violent disorder,in my honest and former defence lawyer opinion. Having read what I could in the reports and accepting I was not in court at the time, I am left wondering just why did he plead to violent disorder, a serious offence, when his part was minimal? His offence really was abusing a police officer, but as it was part of an overall incident of violent disorder, by pleading guilty Mr Lynch was on the hook for the entire incident which turned very serious. Despite having pleaded guilty Mr Lynch was denied a suspended sentence when any reasonable judge could see that he was vulnerable. But Mr Lynch is too dead to object now. They wanted to teach him a lesson, and I’ll say they did so. There are other cases out there where the sentence at least looks disproportionate. But what has troubled me in the last few weeks is just what happened on those first appearances in the magistrates’ court. Of course, it didn’t help that the Prime Minister himself was dragging out the old lectern saying justice would be done, and done swiftly, which intensified an already febrile atmosphere. That was surely the point. And the FRT were given legal advice and ultimately how they plead is entirely their own decision. But all the time people admit offences of which they are not necessarily guilty. Further, even if on the facts the FRT were guilty of the offence I am left thinking that if this was a left-wing cause, many would have entered not guilty pleas. This is because left-wing lawyers are well-organised and the word goes out – don’t rush into anything. Wait until we have given you advice and you have considered all your options. This is all perfectly ethical, and indeed effective. It is downright admirable. My only regret is that this is not what happened with the FRT. Things can change in trial by jury, the light that shows that freedom lives. These FRT, having taken advice and decided to plead not guilty are perfectly entitled to tell the jury how they honestly felt on the day, how it came to be that they were suddenly far-right thugs. ‘Yes, I was angry. Sure I shouldn’t have done what I did but I was furious. I thought of those three girls being stabbed to death and my anger got the better of me. I’m just angry that we have been ignored about immigration for years and years. That my country, my home town, has been changed beyond recognition and no one seems to care. The politicians ignore us time and again – I tried to vote for change but change never comes. So, I got angry. Etc etc.’ This goes before the jury. To convict in a jury trial you need ten of the 12 jurors to say yes, he was guilty. They can return a not guilty verdicteven if the defendant admits the offence in court.It happens all the time and is called jury nullification or jury equity depending on your view. Ten from twelve. I’ll take those odds and any decent defence lawyer should have been willing to take those odds. Now it may be the case that the FRT are getting some decent legal advice now. But the reason they all pleaded guilty is that there are simply not enough right-wing lawyers out there who are as organised and as motivated as their left-wing colleagues. This is the problem with right-wing people – they are in the City, doing commercial stuff with commercial people or whatever the heck it is they do all day. Where they are not is in the law. But plenty of talented left-wing people are, and they look after their own and play for keeps. The right-wingers are not in the arts, crafting well-told and beautiful stories of the human condition from a conservative point of view. But the lefties are influencing the culture day in and day out. Heck, even in the media there are not enough true conservatives, otherwise this piece would have appeared in theDaily Mailor theTelegraph. They would have been asking, what really happened to the FRT in court? So here I am. There we have it. The suspected rapists know how to play the system and will plead not guilty, and hope the trial never happens. Far-right ‘thugs’ on violent disorder charges, or tweeting while angry charges, were just falling over themselves to plead guilty, and receive obviously disproportionate sentences. I am not blaming their lawyers who were there at the time at all. But it might be worth asking just why this happened.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-19T01:17:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-the-law-is-stacked-against-right-thinkers/
What’s the real reason they’re going after Allison Pearson?,"EVER since Allison Pearson wrote about her personal experience of the UK’s ‘two-tier justice system’ in herTelegraph article of November 12, the media in Britain and abroad have been deluged with outrage and condemnation. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has had to intervene after warnings that the current Hate Crime laws were being exploited to stifle free speech. Starmer has recommended that the police focus on tackling violent crime and burglaries instead of questioning people over their social media posts.This is in line with public opinion, but appears to be the opposite of what goes on. The Chief Constable of Essex Police, Ben-Julian Harrington, who sent two of his officers to Allison Pearson’s house on Remembrance Sunday morning, actively encourages public complaints under the Malicious Communications Act (1988). Not content with making sure people know what a hate crime is, he provides blow-by-blow instructions on how to report them on itswebsite. An accompanying booklet called ‘Stop the Hate’ all but suggests it is a public duty to be an informer. With such egging on it’s not so surprising to find that his force received more than 30,000 such complaints in three years between 2019 (9,203), 2020 (10,163) and 2021 (11,069), or that they chose to investigate 29,109 of them.If this is how the force has been wasting its time and resources, no wonder it can’t manage to send an emergency response to all 999 calls about drug dealing, as has been admitted. Neil Gregory, a substitute member of the Essex Police, Fire and Crime Panel, has accused it of ‘an obsession with diversity, neglect of crime, and institutional incompetence and dysfunction on an epic scale’. So is the Pearson response sheer incompetence, or quite deliberate and altogether more menacing? Though the police inquiry is already a year long, and has involved the Met, Essex and Sussex police, it was only last week that the Non Crime Hate Incident (NCHI) accusation was made. Later statements suggested actual criminality, under section 17 of the Public Order Act 1986, but were subsequently denied by Essex.No one seems entirely sure, especially at the Home Office. Crime or Non-Crime? This matters.Julie Bindel reported being visited by police over such an incident in 2019. She too was denied any information about the accusation, and so refused point-blank to attend for interview. But a criminal charge is altogether different, removing any voluntary element. Was this why Essex Police set up a ‘gold group’ to deal with the X post? These are normally set up to deal with major crimes such as terrorist attacks, to ‘support the management of an effective response to the identified matter’. But for a post on X? By Friday, things took an interesting turn.Vikram Dodd, police and crime correspondent of the Guardian, claimed they had ‘found’ details of the incident. A photograph posted several months ago during tensions over policing the Gaza protests showed a group of people of colour with a flag, and three police officers. Pearson’s caption read: ‘How dare they? Invited to pose with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday, police refused. Look at this lot, smiling with the Jew haters.’ It turned out Pearson was wrong when she implied the Muslims in the photograph were Hamas supporters, and quickly deleted the post. But the Guardian endorsed the complainant’s view that she had been racist and inflammatory. They also knew the complainant’s identity – not a Muslim but a person of colour with training in criminal law. It’s the timing of the accusation that stands out, because it followed very closely on the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre. Since 2023, there have been huge demonstrations by pro-Palestinian activists almost weekly in central London, always ‘lightly’ policed with few arrests, in spite of blatantly anti-Semitic banners and chanting ‘From the River to the Sea’, leading many to consider the police show a pro-Hamas bias. On October 7 this year, Pearson bravely published a deeply shocking report in the Telegraph. She had interviewed survivors, soldiers, bereaved parents and the mothers of hostages. Its headline, ‘Not one girl could be shown to her parents’, says it all. She wanted to record the heroism of the victims and the true depravity of the Hamas attack on innocent civilians and stated that she believed the struggle between Israel and Hamas was ‘no mere fight over territory, but a struggle between civilisation and barbarism’. With a Labour government now in Westminster, Pearson’s words were unlikely to go down well with their supporters, including a significant number of Muslim MPs, mayors, senior officials and academics, and other sympathetic communities throughout the country. Not least readers of the Guardian. So how was it that the Guardian, alone among the MSM, was privy to detailed information about the ‘incident’, details which Pearson herself was not entitled to know? Could there have been a leak, or even a deliberate tip-off, to strengthen further the government’s diversity agenda and appease its pro-Palestine voters? And from how high up might it have come? Was it intended to shift the narrative away from sympathising with the sentiments of Pearson’s shocking report, and back to exposing her as a racist Islamophobe? Could it even have been meant to turn the public’s attention away from the disastrous October Budget? We have no way of knowing, but it would follow a recognisable pattern of appeasement towards anti-Israel activists, notably from the police, at the same time as anti-Semitism is rising massively, andoffensive anti-Jewish tweets are not considered ‘offensive enough’ to warrant attention. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is now tasked with reviewing the logging of NCHIs, and wishes to reverse the downgrading recommended by her predecessors. She wants incidents relating to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia to be logged consistently, to avoid any escalation into violence. But her proposals inspire little confidence – the usual ‘focusing on vetting procedures’ and ‘holding forces to account on key metrics’, etc. What she needs to do is refocus her police forces on to real crimes, of which there is no shortage – knifings, shootings, drugs gang violence, burglaries, street muggings, even shoplifting, all of which are of great concern to the public. She would also do well to ensure that applying the Equality Act 2010, which affords special protection to minority groups, is managed fairly and proportionately when dealing with hate crimes against Jews and Christians. Any more failure to rebalance what many perceive as preferential treatment for some religions over others, or even for illegal migrants over upstanding citizens, will result in the Starmer government’s ratings sinking even lower than they already are.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-20T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/whats-the-real-reason-theyre-going-after-allison-pearson/
Health warrior RFK Jr faces coalition of formidable enemies   ,"ROBERT F Kennedy Junior (RFK Jr) is a popular figure in these pages and deservedly so. He’s been a warrior for truth over the excesses of the covid regime in the United States. He committed what the health promotion fanatics would consider the mortal sin of questioning the vaccine strategy. He continues to demand access to data which will show conclusively what every reader of TCW already knows, that the covid vaccines are unsafe. Now, as promised,he has been nominatedby President-elect Donald Trump to the position of Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In that position – provided the Senate do the right thing and not block his nomination – he will have a major influence on US health strategy over the next four years and has already been advising Trump. Despite a Republican majority, RFK Jr, who suspended his campaign to back Trump, is not universally popular. As opponents try to pressure the Senate, he’s likely to have opprobrium heaped on him. If recent reports are anything to go by, every opportunity will be taken to portray him as evil, conspiratorial or mad. As the fact sinks in that the prevailing narrative about public health in the USA – a narrative to which the terminally woke and politically deranged adhere – will no longer dominate the agenda, lockdown fanatics, mask maniacs, covid-vaccine enthusiasts and vested Pharma interests, among others, will do their damnedest to block him. Former Vice President, Mike Pence, has started the call,urging Republicans to reject him. To secure confirmation as HHS Secretary, RFK Jr. needs 50 Senate votes, with J.D. Vance casting a tie-breaking vote if necessary. With enemies like Pence the fact of 53 Republicans in the next Senate is far from a shoo-in. The ‘Leftstream media’, as the editor of TCW recently dubbed them, have for months been laying the groundwork for this eventuality. TheNew York Timesreported that RFK Jr kept ravens as pets, relishing the opportunity to make a play on the otherwise quite respectable collective noun ‘conspiracy of ravens’. TheLos Angeles Timesreported on the ‘unbearable weirdness’ of RFK Jr. Over here theDaily Mailclaims he was a cocaine dealer at university. Speculation about separation from his actress wife (a rubbishy report a month ago in something calledPeople) was taken up by theMail, which reported they ‘looked tense’ at the recentAl Smith Charity dinner, and that he has had multiple affairs with women in the ‘anti-vax’ movement. Yesterday following the announcement of his promotion, the papers did not miss a trick in their campaign to discredit and demonise him. First wastheMail’sreport that the news had sent the stock market into meltdown, followed almost immediately by a gleeful list of‘the most outrageous health claims peddled by the US’ new anti-vaxxer health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr: From ‘chemicals could make you trans’ to the ‘dead worm’ in his brain’. The hystericalGuardiancondemned him as ‘a clear and present danger’ None of these reports look at his evidence based analysis of America’s health crisis – the dramatic and alarming rise in chronic disease – that he has beenspeaking and lecturing on. Maybe theDaily Death(sorry,Mail) will find it has overplayed its hand asexcess deathsmount here and as its ‘not so woke’ readership wake up to the ‘health’ industry’s role in wrecking worldwide economies and lives during the covid regime. No wonder that its most powerful cabals are sweating under their collars right now. RJK Jr has advised he would aim to sack around 600 workers in the National Institute of Health (NIH) and replace them with 600 new workers. Recommending swift action before Trump is inaugurated, he said ‘we want to have those people in place on January 20 so that, on January 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH, and 600 people are going to leave’. He also said ‘entire departments’ of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‘have to go’. Many were behind or part of the global agenda of fear regarding health, perpetuated for their own gain in terms of power and profit. A prime example is our favourite source of poor information on health, the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, who are clearly concerned at the prospect of RFK Jr with his hands on the health portfolio. Their daily newsletter (Global Health Now) of November 7 carried a ‘gift article’ from theNew York Timeswhich, in tone meant to be gobsmacking, was designed to put the boot in. Not only, it claimed, had RFK Jr peddled all sorts of ‘misinformation about vaccines’ but also he was a lawyer with ‘no medical or public-health degrees’. Indeed, he has neither medical nor public-health degrees, but he is a well-educated and effective lawyer who has been studying, and successfully suing large corporations for the addition of, harmful food additives. For example, he successfully sued the agricultural giant Monsanto for the use of a carcinogenic herbicide which found its way into the food chain. In a recent video he explains the provenance and dangers of the common food dye tartrazine, already banned in some countries but still found in sweets designed for consumption by children. This is a man who clearly cares about the health of individuals and the nation, in contrast to recent incumbents, in particular Anthony Fauci, who served the needs of Big Pharma from which many suspect he, in turn, profited. Regarding the covid years, RFK Jr’s ‘expertise’ is not insignificant. He researched and wrote a book onAnthony Fauci, formerly Chief Medical Advisor to the President of United States and long term Director of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and his links with Bill Gates and Big Pharma. He also exposed, in aNew York Timesbestseller, the cover-up of the development of bioweapons in Wuhan. RFK Jr does his homework and is unafraid to ask inconvenient questions the likes of Fauci, Gates, the NIH and the FDA do not want asked. And, unlike them, he seems to care about the health of the American people. Is expertise, of the professional qualifications sort, specific to a political portfolio an absolute requirement? In fact a case could be made that they are a hindrance, especially for a health portfolio, since health professionals are educated and trained to think in particular ways, akin to brainwashing. They adhere with religious fervour to well-established tropes, especially regarding public health. Few will speak out when they see something wrong, and the hell of cancellation, professional investigation and possible loss of career and income awaits those who do. We have the covid years to prove the point. The medical and nursing professions largely sang from the same hymn sheet. Inculcated with vaccine ideology, almost to a man and woman, they jumped on the bandwagon in the face of evidence from the outset the vaccines were ineffective and in the face of subsequent evidence they were clearly dangerous. So dangerous, in fact, that the US state of Idaho banned them. A fresh, albeit ‘unqualified’, pair of eyes with a perspective uncluttered by prior assumptions is exactly what is required to steer health policy. After all, whether experts on health or not, the non-medically qualified majority of the population are consumers of what Big Pharma inflicts on them. Are our interests best served, therefore, by qualified and probably brainwashed health professionals or by well-educated and influential figures like RFK Jr, unafraid to speak their minds and ask the awkward questions? Of course, now RFK Jr has been nominated for the health portfolio he will, if the appointment stands, be judged by his actions. For example, he has promised to stop the fluoridation of tap water across the US; it will be interesting to see if he can achieve that. He has long referred to this additive, purportedly used to promote dental health, as toxic, and there is research on the lowering of IQ in children to support this. In contrast to the opprobrium heaped on RFK Jr and the likelihood of more now he is appointed, take the case of Gates. The UK Prime Minister, barely in office, has already met the man and described as ‘great’ their time together. The PM’s immediate predecessor exuded enthusiasm about meeting Gates during his unmemorable time at Number 10. Everyone, it seems, wants to meet Gates to seek his advice on all manner of things such as poverty (what would he know about that?), climate change and, indeed, vaccines. If his lack of qualifications (of which he has none) are ever referred to it is with awe that someone who dropped out of university could achieve so much. The fact there is such opposition to RFK Jr being involved in decisions about health has nothing to do with his lack of qualifications. That is the reddest of herrings. It is simply down to the fact he is not ‘on message’ with any of the left-leaning liberal agenda and opposes intrusive public-health interventions. Gates, on the other hand, is ‘on message’ – the global vaccine message he has so assiduously pushed, promoted and profited by – and that makes a world of difference for him. Unfortunately, it makes the world a worse place for us.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:19:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/health-warrior-rfk-jr-faces-coalition-of-formidable-enemies/
"So cruel, so vulnerable – the Daycare Generation","THE LAST few days in the life of Alexander Rogers must have been consumed by darkness and loneliness. On the outside he was privileged: he was one of those white, heterosexual males we hear so much about, a good-looking third-year materials science student at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Unfortunately for Alexander, he lived in 2024. Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn’t happy about. As pertheTimes,‘She had expressed “discomfort” about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the “allegations”. They told him they believed he had “messed up”, that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later.’ Rogers had appeared ‘distraught after this conversation’. He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation. Emergency services retrieved his body from the water and found he had suffered a head trauma. You can only imagine what his parents went through when they picked up the phone. What they felt when they had to identify his body. The ostracism inflicted on Alexander was certainly effective. It was swift but not justice. At the inquest, coroner Nicholas Graham found that on the balance of probabilities this culture of exclusion did not contribute to Alexander’s decision to take his own life. But he added: ‘It is certainly possible that such a culture influenced the actions of Alexander’s peers in forming the judgments that they did; it is also possible that Alexander felt that – because of this culture – there was no way of getting back into the social group that obviously meant so much to him once he had been excluded. What I cannot say is that this was probable.’ In fact, this culture of exclusion and isolation was found by the coroner to be widespread and so dangerous that he has spoken out against it. Graham, the area coroner for Oxfordshire, has written to the Department for Education with concerns that ‘exclusionary behaviour’ is becoming commonplace on campuses. He called on ministers to take action, warning that future deaths could result if the issue was not addressed. ‘There is concern that social ostracism has become normalised within student communities, with individuals viewing it as an expected and accepted response to certain allegations or behaviours,’ Graham wrote. ‘This normalisation hinders the development of healthy and supportive social environments.’ Why would these students, the younger brothers and sisters of the Millennials, who pride themselves so much on being kind, on being ‘awake to social injustices’, who will have grown up with circle time, star of the week, and buddy systems engage in such a brutal culture of isolation? The fact that young men are engaging in behaviour that was once considered mostly female behaviour – the bitching, the exclusion, the social isolation in sum, mean girls behaviour – is frightening and telling. Previously, disputes like this might have been settled with a fist fight. Instead of settling these issues like men, the coroner explained how the isolation works: He wrote: ‘The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] “pile-on” might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual.’ In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a “pile-on” and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape. The fact that Alexander took his life a mere two days after his friends told him he was now firmly on the outside and that they ‘would check up on him a couple of weeks later’ is evidence of how devastating this behaviour is. They didn’t give him a badge to wear – perhaps a scarlet letter – but they didn’t have to. The word will have gone out. Alexander Rogers was persona non grata. A modern leper. I wonder how many of these Oxford friends took up the chance to check up on him at his funeral? Why did his friends engage in this behaviour, so clearly unethical, so obviously cruel? Why did no one speak up on his behalf? Did not a single friend say, this seems a bit harsh, or let’s refer it to the college authorities? I suspect they were all too terrified of each other, that they would be next, they would be the one on the outside. Again, it demonstrates how brutal and effective woke social exclusion is. It is also worth asking why Alexander was so sensitive to this exclusion. This woke generation, who pride themselves on kindness while cutting their friends off at the legs, and those who suffer at their hands, are unique in their actions and responses. They are uniquely vulnerable and insecure. They are too peer-oriented because they have been denied a secure attachment when they were young. And they have been denied that attachment because this is the daycare generation grown up. We are seeing the results of this daycare experiment now, 20 years on. I say this not to add to the devastating loss of Alexander’s family. But it is worth thinking about. I have reason to believe one of my own children is insecurely attached, although I tried my best, so I am not judging. But as we seem so firmly on this path, with the government funding institutional care of very young babies to the tune of millions, it is worth asking what you are going to get at the end of it. I believe we are ending up with insecure young adults too attached to peer groups that will turn on each other on a dime, with terrible results. This isn’t pure speculation; it is a conclusion I have come to after reading two books by Dr Gabor Maté,Scattered MindsandThe Myth of Normal. Maté says that one of his sons, now an adult, said ‘as a teenager I was consumed by what my friends thought of me, how much they liked me, what it took to fit in with their expectation’. Maté concludes: ‘Of course, his peer orientation was not about his peers per se; it was a natural outcome of his parents’ lack of availability as emotionally attuned adults in his early years.’ Maté makes clear in this book and another,Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers, is that this is not about teenagers moving away from their parents to form an independent and authentic self. That is natural. Instead, with this generation the move away from the parents towards peers is a false independence. They do not have a chance to develop their own identity. They are crippled by what their peers think of them. And if they think badly, if they put you in the colony marked ‘you messed up and took advantage of a woman’, you can only imagine the damage, the shattering of the internal self to a young man. It’s the kind of thing that makes you jump into the river to end it all. A total rejection by those whose opinion you care about the most: your friends. As Maté states, ‘As a rule, immature peers are constitutionally incapable of accepting each other “as is”; or holding space for the vulnerable experience of emotion, let alone its open expression; or relieving one another’s stressed states; or celebrating or even tolerating temperamental differences. Left to its own callow devices, the peer group can offer only acceptance that is highly conditional and thus insecure, often demanding self-suppression and conformity in place of true individuality.’ The Tories decided on a massive expansion of childcare for babies as young as nine months. We atTCWhave always objected to this government policy and on further reflection I believe things will only get worse unless we understand the damage we are inflicting on our children in their hundreds of thousands. There are the rare cases where children are subject to serious abuse in crèches, and then there are all the other toddlers left bewildered and unable to find comfort and love as they compete for attention with other confused toddlers. Friends from home, those who grew up with Alex in Salisbury, said he ‘was undeniably caring. He would fill up a room with his laughs and smiles and brought so much joy to us all. A man that lived life to the full, who gave us our favourite stories and memories and whom we miss deeply’.Another friend, Olivia O’Donnell, who completed the Salisbury Plain Half Marathon in his memory, said: ‘To this day, I cannot fathom this loss, and I will forever love him with all my heart. Alex spread joy and held the brightest smile in the room. The laughter he spread will never leave us, but at 20 years old, he was taken from us far before his time.’ We can only hope that Alexander Rogers finds the peace and love in death that he was unable to find in his young adult life.

Killing freedom under the banner of public health,"WEIGHT loss injections were recently proposed by the Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting as an incentive to get unemployed people suffering from weight-related health issues back into work. Fat chance that Streeting’s drug ordinance will solve social ills. (It is more likely to createnew medical ones.) Streeting’s comments (downplayed of course as with all the other lies of the last four years) have further highlighted the clear political motivations behind the ominous direction of the UK healthcare system. From 2020, we have seen an implosion of citizen rights and responsibilities, from enforced lockdowns, social distancing and covid wardens on the street, right up to ‘jabs for jobs’. All this has been justified under the banner of public health. During the 1950s, the American sociologistTalcott Parsonswas the first to explore the relationship between citizenship and health, coining the phrase ‘the sick role’. Revisiting Emile Durkheim’s earlier sociological theory ofstructural functionalismand the idea that all elements of society ultimately contribute to social order, Parsons aimed to demonstrate this in a unique way. He argued that ill-health highlights what happens when societal roles are suspended and people withdraw from their everyday duties. Parsons suggested that the sick role is as much about the resulting social and cultural responses which occur as it is about the incapacitating conditions themselves. Whenever we opt out of our designated responsibilities and citizen duties through adverse health, he observed, the sick role serves to bring two rights and two responsibilities into focus that ordinarily uphold and contribute to social order. As Paul Taylor explains in his book‘Sociology in Focus‘, ‘Illness is not a not simply a state of fact or condition but a specifically patterned social role.’ So what are the rights and obligations Parsons speaks of and how do they relate to health and wellbeing in modern society? Rights • Firstly, Parsons argued that a sick person is generally regarded as being temporarily exempt from their normal societal role and accompanying duties. The more severe the condition, the greater the justification for exemption. A sick person, he reasoned, holds a democratic right to withdraw from their societal role for the duration of a health condition. Thus, a person may take time off work or withdraw from family duties when they are ill. Parsons argued that it is important to understand that this exemption status is dependent on the severity and type of affliction. • Secondly, a person is not generally held to be responsible for an illness or health condition. Being ill is generally considered to be out of a person’s control, so it is accepted that they have a right to be taken care of and to receive the necessary treatment. This status might be different if a person is suffering from a self-inflicted health condition, such as alcoholism, drug addiction or obesity – as we shall see, health conditions where personal responsibility might be attributed have conditions attached to these rights. Obligations • A sick person is expected to hold the view that their condition is undesirable and that their exemption from society is only temporary. Parsons argues that those who occupy the sick role are under an obligation to get well again and return to their societal duties as soon as they are able. • A person occupying the sick role is expected to go along with the advice of experts in the medical profession, or to liaise with knowledgeable professionals to give themselves the best chance of getting well again. The sick role is rubber-stamped by medical professionals – either directly or via generally held perspectives on the latest scientific evidence – where this expertise can either justify or discredit leave of absence from a person’s normal social role. This second obligation is fundamental to Parsons’s argument, where he reasons that the sick role demonstrates the power of the medical establishment in our society. Not only is the bio-medical model of health the recognised authority on the classification and the identification of illness, but the dominant healthcare model holds the principal monopoly on the legitimate practices on prognosis, healing and cure. All four of the rights and obligations outlined by Parsons are ultimately dependent on procedures and practices which have been established by the dominant agencies of medical healthcare. Re-emphasising the philosophy of functionalism as a theory of social order, Parsons proposed that the sick role is a unique combination of value themes, juxtaposed around vulnerability and deviancy. While a person suffering from an illness might be characterised on the one hand as being vulnerable and in need of care and treatment, the sick role is also deviant in the sense that the suspension of citizen duties and obligations may become attractive for all the wrong reasons. Parsons argues that this role must be managed by the state to prevent a breakdown in social order. The idea that illness can be understood by observing citizen rights and responsibilities is particularly relevant to covid-era healthcare. The medical pharmaceutical complex has assumed unprecedented influence over our lives since 2020 and the wholesale transformation in our rights and responsibilities became dependent upon following the advice of medical professionals. A ‘good citizen’ followed the guidelines that were rolled out. Many actually called for citizen rights to be taken away from people who were labelled ‘free-riders’. COVID: unvaccinated people may be seen as ‘free riders’ and face discrimination People were refused medical treatment if they were unvaccinated, and many lost jobs for questioning or refusing to follow their new obligations as citizens. The nature of Parsons’s concept of the sick role changed during this time. There was an implicit understanding that people suffering from covid held priority over those waiting for treatment from other medical conditions. These people now became peripheralised by the medical establishment, with many dying because the healthcare system was ‘overwhelmed’ by the pandemic. The shadow of compulsory vaccination hung has over this period, a situation where all human rights would have been suspended. Among the endless range of magic bullets now being promised for a widening range of previously intractable health conditions, Streeting’s comments highlight the dangerous repositioning of our healthcare systems around the increasingly nefarious intentions of the state. Our citizenship status is now more and more based upon the power of politicians and their allies to define health and wellbeing, and our willingness to go along with their increasingly dubious solutions.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/killing-freedom-under-the-banner-of-public-health/
The climate scaremongers – energy operator tells Miliband: Your plans cannot work,"LABOUR’S manifesto promised we would have a zero carbon electricity system by 2030. It is a pledge that Ed Miliband has been making for years, not least in his party conference speech last year, and it was also one of Labour’s ‘Five Missions for a Better Britain’ policy pledge launched last year. It would therefore be reasonable to presume that Miliband had a detailed plan of how he would achieve this and in particular how much it might all cost. So it came as a surprise when shortly after taking office in July he asked the National Energy System Operator, NESO, to provide practical advice on achieving the target. NESO have now responded with some bad news! Many energy experts have long argued that a zero carbon grid simply is not possible at these timescales, because you cannot run a grid predominantly on intermittent renewable energy. It turns out that NESO, whose job is to make sure that Britain has the electricity has it needs every second of the day, agree. Their reportsent to Ed Miliband emphasises that we will need to retain a full fleet of gas power plants to fire up when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine: This really is a damning indictment not only of Labour’s energy policy, but also of the whole Net Zero agenda and its reliance on intermittent renewable energy. Even though NESO say that gas power will supply only 5 per cent of our electricity, they admit there will be many days when we will need it for half our power or more, just as we do now. And keeping a fleet of gas plants on standby creates problems of its own. They will need to be fully manned all year, fully maintained, and ready to fire up when needed, all of which will cost a lot of money. With these plants standing idle most of the time, operators will demand billions in standby payments, all of which will end up on our energy bills. We will have to pay for two electricity systems – one for when the wind blows, and the other for when it does not! The NESO report also confirms that the increase in wind and solar power demanded by Miliband will drastically increase bills, not lower them as we were promised. Not only is renewable energy more expensive to produce than gas generation, there are indirect costs to consider, such as the standby capacity mentioned above, storage, curtailment payments when we have too much wind, and grid upgrades. Analysis of NESO data suggests that annual costs could be £20billion higher by 2030 if Miliband’s plans are carried through. NESO also say that annual investment of £48billion will be needed for grid upgrades between now and 2030 to achieve targets. All this expenditure will merely end up duplicating what we already have. If this was not all bad enough, over-reliance on intermittent renewables will mean that we will end up having energy rationing. According to NESO, households will have to switch off appliances at times of peak demand. Currently, of course, gas generation is turned up and down to match demand. They hope the public will do it voluntarily! Good luck with that. The reality is that there will be brownouts and punitive pricing to discourage electricity consumption at peak times. Unsurprisingly, Ed Miliband has already been bragging that this new report proves that his clean power plan is both achievable and will lead to cheaper electricity. Both are outright lies. But it looks as if we will have to prove this the hard way! Bragging in Baku SIR Keir Starmer flew out to Azerbaijan to make a speech at COP29 on Tuesday. He is obviously deluded enough to think that the rest of the world would pay the slightest attention to the platitudes and lies he delivered in his usual monotone. It was almost as if his speech had been written by ChatBot. He talked of a climate crisis, opportunities for Britain, 1.5C warming and technologies of the future. He lied that Net Zero would bring energy independence, by which he meant reliance on the EU for electricity imports, and boosting living standards, when his plans will push up energy prices and destroy jobs. He bragged about stopping new North Sea oil and gas licences, while spending billions on inefficient technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. And he claimed the UK was a ‘climate leader’, committing to an 81 per cent cut in emissions by 2035 (meaning a cut of 65 per cent from today’s emissions). He does not seem to realise that nobody else is in this race. Meanwhile Azerbaijan’s President revealed the same day that his country would continue to exploit its God-given reserves of oil and gas. As ever with COPs, this one is all about the money. COP29’s President, the Azerbaijani Minister for Ecology, demanded $8trillion to ‘fight climate change’, claiming that we had ‘marshalled’ the same amount to fight Covid-19. Will Starmer and Lammy have the backbone to stand up to this blackmail? I doubt it. Over 66,000 are attending the jamboree, including 470 ministers and officials from the UK. Yet curiously only 3,975 have registered for ‘virtual online’ participation. So much for saving the planet! Why, for instance, did Starmer fly out to make a speech that nobody took any notice of? Could he not have done a video presentation instead? As for the other 469 bureaucrats and ministers, why are we even employing them? Nothing they do will alter the weather.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-15T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-energy-operator-tells-miliband-your-plans-cannot-work/
"Here is the long-term weather report: same old, same old","I HAVE been living for over 77 years, and for half of that time I have apparently been living through a time of increasing climate risk, now escalated to a climate emergency. Perhaps I was sleeping, but I hadn’t really noticed. What I have noticed over the years has been the occurrence of a wide variety of different and severe weather events, something which I learnt early on in developing my interest in weather was a salient feature of life in the British Isles with its frequent changes of dominant air masses. I was born in February 1947, in bitter, winter weather, not alleviated by the immediate post-war austerity. My father then decided we should move from Surrey to Dovercourt, once popular as a bracing East Coast resort adjacent to Harwich. Being taken there at six months old has always seemed to me a sort of survival ritual, akin to the custom of the Spartans, leaving their newborns out on the mountains. The first major weather event the I experienced at first hand was the East Coast storm of January 3/February 1, 1953. This really was a major event, and huge areas of eastern England were flooded by the North Sea. By then we had moved to Ipswich, which was fortunate, as there were a number of fatalities in Harwich and at many locations in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. The day prior to those floods, the same weather system brought severe gales across Scotland and Northern Ireland and caused the sinking of a rail ferry between Stranraer and Larne with the loss of over 100 lives. There was no debate, however, about climate change or zero carbon; rather it was about how to improve defences, flood warnings and responses. It was obvious from historical records that such events were far from unprecedented. Coronation Day, June 2, 1953, was much anticipated, but it turned out wet, cold and miserable. My parents were never great on ‘big occasions’, so we went, as I remember, out for a bicycle ride in the country around Ipswich. Many people have childhood memories bathed in warmth and sunshine, but most of my early memories conjure up more of wet and cold. I remember the contrasting summers of 1958 and 1959. Rain seemed to dominate August 1958, at least so it appeared on the days when we attempted trips to the seaside or during a memorable thunderstorm as we walked back to Liverpool Street station from the Tower of London. I was beginning to take a keen interest in cricket and would listen toTest Match Specialon the radio, but that summer’s test series against New Zealand was constantly interrupted by rain. 1959 was the opposite: the sun shone well into the autumn, it hardly rained through September and into October, and so we were restricted to playing touch rugby until the October half-term. Following the long drought of 1959, I identified that for many parts of Southeast England, the 14-month period from December 1959 to January 1961 produced two years’ worth of average rainfall. I recall frequent extensive floods on Suffolk rivers and many soil slumps on the banks of deep lanes. 1960 produced widespread flooding around Exeter, which nine years later gave me early work experience of historic flood analysis for the Devon River Authority. Winter 1962/63 was extreme by anybody’s reckoning. I had by then become so interested in weather that I was taking daily temperature readings on a maximum-minimum thermometer mounted on a north-facing wall. From the day when the snow arrived in a blizzard on December 27 until March 3, the minimum temperature did not rise above 0°C. A warm front from the Atlantic tried to make inroads on the blocking high toward the end of January, and two drizzly days did push temperature up to 1°C, so there were 62 consecutive days with frost. The weather was dominated by dry easterly winds, and I was able to watch the process of ablation gradually reduce the depth of lying snow. I also carried out an experiment where I placed a pebble on the solid ice that filled an old roasting tin in the garden: I noted over a period of a few days how the pebble gradually sank into the ice as a result of its weight (pressure), melting a thin layer of ice beneath it, just as described in the Physical Geography textbooks. By now climatologists were concentrating on possibilities of the return of at least a mini-ice-age, exacerbated by fears of attempted climate manipulation by Russian nuclear testing in northern Siberia. I shall not prolong this catalogue of events, but suffice it to say that these weather extremes were experienced by many people in the UK. Why have these been ignored by today’s media when it comes to reporting severe events? What is behind the collective amnesia, or in more modern parlance, ‘denial’? And of course regular severe events continued. These included violent thunderstorms in East Anglia in July 1968 (coinciding with my graduation) and a few weeks later, to disrupt my journey to Belfast to take up my first postgraduate appointment. I missed the flooding events that affected Sussex, Kent and Essex on September 14/1, 1968. There was a major storm and flood over Hampstead Heath in August 1975, which I witnessed from Wimbledon; I was also involved in the immediate post-event analysis. I left the UK just as the prolonged summer heatwave of 1976 began and spent most of the next 22 years working abroad, mostly in monsoon and tropical climates. At least I had plenty of experience of tropical downpours, monsoon deluges and long, hot droughts – enough to realise that the weather-related adjectives now used by the media in this country are somewhat exaggerated! During my absence from the UK between 1976 and 1998, a revolution in the TV presentation of weather forecasting took place. Francis Wilson was one of the first to use graphics to depict the movement of weather systems, a process that had already been started by several commercial TV weather channels in the USA. Michael Fish of course became famous overnight with his ‘no hurricane’ statement during the devastating 1987 storm. In the UK, TV weather forecast became media- and personality-orientated and no longer the preserve of a formalised statement pattern issued from the Met Office. I was present when ‘climate change’ perhaps went public, at the Lacey Memorial Lecture 1991 to the Institution of Civil Engineers by Sir John Mason, Director General of the Met Office. He introduced the topic as a focus of research by the Met Office that could be of interest to civil engineers. In an unbiased, non-committal summary, he gave his opinion that the world was under greatest threat from population growth, which for two decades became a central theme of David Attenborough! Climate-change theory became focussed in the 1990s on large-scale droughts, especially inthe Sahel. This was a well documented situation, and indeed serious, but it was not unprecedented, though the populations involved were. The drought eventually eased and by the early 2000s the greening of the Sahara became evident from satellite imagery. In the UK the 1990s were also marked by droughts, and widespread concern over drying up of major reservoirs, groundwater sources, river headwaters, etc – which eventually of course recovered. In 1998 it started raining with a vengeance. Widespread flooding in April prompted the government to take a concerted look at all aspects of flooding, culminating in the production ofthe Bye Report. Mr Bye was a prominent civil servant, not an engineer, hydrologist or meteorologist. No sooner had the industry started to respond to the Bye Report than a series of major floods occurred from October 2000 to October 2002, and this concentrated the mind wonderfully. I was seconded from HR Wallingford to a National Flood Warning Centre (England and Wales), a joint operation between the Environment Agency and the Met Office. This secondment lasted nearly two years and was very interesting. Our first ‘active’ flood found two or three of us working late, desperately trying to locate flooded sites on an AA Road Atlas! The operation and organisation would become much slicker and more thorough, developing websites that provided near-real-time updated data on river levels, rainfall, and weather radar, and also flood forecasts and warnings. There were people in the group from media and political backgrounds and ‘blue sky’ thinkers who began to provide the impetus for thoughts on climate change. One interesting thing to emerge in examining the locations of major floods in winter 2000/01 was the amazing similarity they bore to the flooding of 1851. This information was readily available in theBritishHydrochronology(Frank Law-British Hydrological Society), which catalogues all major floods from written sources. The first entry was from the 13th century, so information existed on the severity of past floods to which today’s ‘unprecedented’ events can be compared. Various groups with political agendas, and especially the television and press media, began to raise the question of climate change influencing individual weather events. These influences were denied by professional engineers, meteorologists and hydrologists, but eventually the pressure told, and in 2010/11 the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology made a statement conceding that a single event could be influenced by recent global warming. This has since opened the floodgates for a range of half-baked opinions and wild speculations. The flights of fancy have lately produced such irrelevant ideas as ‘named storms’ and the shifting of climate change to far more exaggerated and emotive terms like ‘climate catastrophe’ or ‘climate emergency’; even ‘global burning’. I hope I have made clear a few climate vicissitudes during the first 30 years of my life. I had become professionally involved in hydrometeorology over that period, and do not recall any great concern over climate changeper se. There had certainly been a lot of interest in catchment studies and severe rainfall events. The publication of the NERC Flood Studies Report in 1975 was a major achievement in objective analysis for dam and river flood design. Only in the period since 2010 has the fixation on climate change ballooned. To my mind this has been the result of political pressure, whatever the reasons. The make-up and variety of weather across the British Isles has remained unchanged; thus the climate is about the same as before.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/here-is-the-long-term-weather-report-same-old-same-old/
Revealed: Pfizer’s hidden vaccine injuries ,"MAINSTREAM media has extensively reported on the catastrophic injuries caused byAstraZeneca’scovid vaccination but has yet to detail the truth about Pfizer-BioNTech’s covid jab. Hidden in America’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), there is a significant number of detailed, serious, adverse events from the UK, all relating to Pfizer’s injection and submitted by Pfizer. VAERS collects post-vaccine injury data from other countries, not just the US, and by November 11 2022, two years into the covid vaccination drive, it had published 103,000 British reports. UK citizens suffered multiple serious symptoms including debilitating headache, chest pain and heart abnormalities, anaphylaxis, clots, vision problems, serious autoimmune conditions and tinnitus. Many patients described a metallic taste in the mouth which can be a sign of poisoning, or neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a paralysing, potentially fatal autoimmune condition known to be linked to the Pfizer jab. By December 8, 2021, the UK’s Yellow Card Scheme had received69 reports of GBSlinked with Pfizer jabs but did not consider this statistically significant compared with incidence in the wider population. The cause of GBS is ‘unknown’ or to use a more recent word, ‘baffling’, meaning it is not possible to rule out vaccination as a cause. According to the respected journalNature,GBS is a known reaction to many vaccines, including covid mRNA. Disturbingly, 13 per cent of the 103,000 VAERS British reports related to the under-25 age group, which according to pathologist Clare Craig dispels the myth that vaccine reactions occur only in the elderly. She said: ‘This statistic suggests that young people are not immune to experiencing adverse reactions, challenging the notion that vaccine side effects are coincidences that occur predominantly in older, sicker populations. The median age of individuals reporting adverse events was 41, indicating that middle-aged adults represent a substantial portion of the reports.’ The MHRA Yellow Card Scheme recorded 2,240 suspected deaths. AstraZeneca vaccines are associated with most deaths. Pfizer comes a close second. The reports detail cases of death, life-threatening conditions and hospitalisation all linked to the Pfizer jab. Most patients, 83 per cent, were available for follow-up consultations which added credibility, but few were contacted according to the data. Pro-vaxers dismiss the Yellow Card Scheme, collated by our drugs watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), saying that anyone can add them, but most, if not all, events found in VAERS have detailed descriptions probably submitted by clinicians and pharmacists. Distressing examples include a 30-year-old woman with no co-morbidities, who suffered life-threatening anaphylaxis after receiving Pfizer batch number EJ0553 on December 18, 2020. Her throat swelled and her condition was assessed as being ‘medically significant and life-threatening’. She was patient report number GB-MHRA-ADR 24545042. One man, age unknown, was admitted to hospital on December 17, 2020, spitting blood, vomiting blood, bleeding from his nose, with headache and dizziness. He suffered a horrible death three days later. His report number is GB-MHRA-ADR 24545199, batch number unknown, and his death was considered ‘unexplained’. The batch numbers are significant. The US chart below shows that some batches caused 100 times more adverse events than others. Was this because the public were part of the trial with some vials having more active ingredient than others? A Danish studypublished in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation in July, 2023 suggests this is the case. The population of Denmark is 5.8million and received 52 batches that had three different adverse event outcomes. Researchers examined suspected adverse events (SAEs) for the Pfizer vaccine and produced the graph below. The blue line clearly shows thousands more reactions than the green line, while the yellow line could have been placebo as not a single SAE was reported. The following table relates to the ten worst Pfizer batches used in the UK and was obtained under freedom of information from the MHRA in September 2024. At some stage, probably after 2021, the publicly available reports suddenly disappeared. VAERS published a disclaimer stating that the data had been deleted at the request of the European regulators. Thankfully, Marek Pawlewski, a data scientist who worked in the hi-tech industry for over 30 years, had the foresight to download it. His subsequent analysis (below) highlights important symptoms taken from a list of over 5,000. Neither the MHRA nor any other drug regulatory agency have explained why they failed to pull the covid vaccines. In 2009, the vaccine Pandemrix was introduced during the swine flu pandemic. It was discontinued after34 deaths.Covid vaccines caused 273 per cent more deaths per 1,000 doses compared with Pandemrix but are still available with the MHRA stating ‘they are the best defence against covid’. Pawlewski also calculated the harms caused by the flu jab between January 1, 2020 and December 13, 2020, compared with the covid jab a year later from December 14, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Both periods are around 11.5 months. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 50 per cent of the US population were vaccinated with the flu vaccine, and approximately 70 per cent of the US population were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 over the same time frame. The final comparison was adjusted to account for the difference between the uptake of the two jabs. Like the MHRA, VAERS is a victim of under-reporting, receiving around ten per cent of reactions. Some say it could be as low as one per cent. Nevertheless, the calculation shows that a person is 91 times more likely to die after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; that someone is 80 times more likely to be hospitalised after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; a person is 81 times more likely to develop a life-threatening event after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine and someone is 82 times more likely to experience a serious adverse event after a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine. Even with reports that were less serious, someone was 42 times more likely to report a less serious event if they had the covid jab compared with the flu jab. This data was submitted to the Metropolitan Police at Hammersmith Police station in December 2021 by former GP partner Dr Sam White, solicitors Philip Hyland and Lois Bayliss and retired police officer Mark Sexton, as evidence of malfeasance. The team were issued a crime number, 6029679/21, and subsequently sent the police hundreds of official documents provided by scientists including retired Pharma executive Sasha Latypova and former Pfizer Vice President Mike Yeadon. Inexplicably, the police took no further action. Pawlewski said: ‘Before all this I was minding my own business and didn’t question vaccines. I had one AstraZeneca and had flu symptoms for over a week, my wife had the same and we decided to get no more. Then a friend sent me a video produced by [researcher and computer programmer] Craig Paardekooper who was also tracking data that showed some batches were worse than others. [Paardekooper then started his websiteHow Bad Is My Batch.] I watched it and thought there’s no way, then I downloaded the data myself, checked it, and he was right. I then asked my colleague Jason Morphett, an experienced data scientist, to independently review the data. He reached the same conclusion. ‘I was shocked and worried for friends and family which is why I shared the information with the police. I thought once they had it, they would stop the vaccine rollout in its tracks, but nothing happened. That woke me up big time.’ The MHRA said: ‘The MHRA does not directly report suspected adverse drug reaction reports to the US VAERS system. However, vaccine manufacturers are required by US law to submit certain foreign (non-US) source adverse event reports to VAERS. ‘We continue to review reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome received following vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines. ‘Every medicine or vaccine is assessed by the MHRA independently based on its own benefits and risks. For the Covid-19 vaccines, the benefits continue to outweigh any known side effects.’ VAERS state: ‘Under US regulations, vaccine manufacturers must report to VAERS each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected, whether foreign or domestic, as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the applicant.’ NOTE: By November 11 2021, 701million doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine had been administered, with nearly 800,000 reports of suspected adverse events made to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-11T01:19:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/revealed-pfizers-hidden-vaccine-injuries/
