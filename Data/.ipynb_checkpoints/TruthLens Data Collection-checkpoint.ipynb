    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of four categories, based on an adaption of Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 400 pieces of content for each of the 4 categories. The 4 categories chosen are: fabricated content, polarised content, satire, commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|*Misreporting* | *Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification.* | *A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.*|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|*Persuasive information* |*Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda.* |*Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.*|\n",
    "|*Citizen journalism* | *User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias.* |*Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.*|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites or sources for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below. Media Boas scores are take from Ad Fontes Media's Media Bias Chart: https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive"

Whistleblowers (whose identities remain unverified) claim that multinational drug companies, fearing a catastrophic loss of profits, have conspired to bury the research and discredit its findings.

Nonetheless, the story has ignited fervent discussion among alternative health advocates and conspiracy theorists, with many calling for independent investigations into the alleged cover-up.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"Government-Secret Vaccines and the Hidden Agenda\", \"In a narrative that has rapidly spread through social media channels, unverified sources now claim that several governments have developed secret vaccines—not to combat diseases, but to implant mind-control nanobots in unsuspecting citizens. According to the entirely fabricated account, these covert vaccines were engineered in hidden research facilities and are being distributed covertly alongside routine immunizations. Insiders allege that top government officials have conspired with shadowy biotech firms to implement the program as part of a larger scheme to control public behavior and suppress dissent. Detailed but unverifiable “leaks” include diagrams of nanobot technology and supposed internal memos outlining the project’s phases. Public health authorities and independent scientists have dismissed the claims as absurd and lacking any empirical basis, yet the narrative continues to fuel heated debates online. The story has become a rallying cry for those suspicious of government overreach, even as experts warn that the entire account is a complete fabrication designed to stoke fear and mistrust in established health institutions.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Fabricated Epidemic That Never Was\",\"A recent series of posts on fringe health forums has claimed that an epidemic sweeping the globe is nothing more than a carefully orchestrated fabrication by international health agencies. According to these unfounded accounts, the so-called outbreak of a novel virus was deliberately invented to enforce draconian public health measures and expand governmental control over citizens’ lives. Fabricated “data” presented in the posts—including manipulated graphs and fake expert testimonies—purports to show that infection rates were grossly exaggerated and that the virus was engineered in a laboratory as part of a secret experiment. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary provided by reputable global health organizations, the narrative has gained traction among communities predisposed to distrust official sources. Detractors of the mainstream narrative argue that the epidemic is a hoax designed to justify unprecedented restrictions on personal freedom. While scientists and public health experts have thoroughly debunked the claims, the rumor of a fabricated epidemic persists as one of the most controversial and persistent conspiracy theories in the health sphere.\", \"health\"],\n",

According to this entirely fabricated narrative, the Directorate operates behind the scenes to determine which diseases receive funding for research and which innovative treatments are suppressed to protect the interests of certain pharmaceutical giants. Leaked “internal documents” (all of which have been debunked by experts) supposedly reveal that this shadow group manipulates clinical trial outcomes and deliberately withholds breakthrough therapies from the public. One supposed insider explained that the Directorate’s ultimate goal is to monopolize global healthcare, ensuring that all new treatments funnel profits exclusively to a handful of powerful corporations. While mainstream scientists and healthcare professionals have dismissed these claims as pure fantasy, the idea of a hidden health organization continues to resonate with individuals suspicious of modern medicine and its regulatory framework.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Pseudoscientific Breakthrough that Shocked Experts\", \"A recent online buzz has centered on reports of a pseudoscientific breakthrough—allegedly discovered by a renegade group of researchers—that claims to reverse aging and cure terminal illnesses in a single treatment. According to the fabricated account, the breakthrough involves a complex combination of gene therapy and nanotechnology, developed in a secret laboratory hidden beneath an abandoned industrial complex. The story goes on to assert that leading medical experts worldwide have been silenced or coerced into keeping the discovery under wraps, with influential institutions allegedly colluding to protect lucrative existing treatments. Detailed but entirely spurious “research notes” and blurry laboratory images have been circulated to support the claim. Despite the sensational nature of the announcement, no peer-reviewed studies or independent verifications exist to corroborate the story. Health authorities and renowned scientists have categorically refuted the claims, calling the report a dangerous piece of misinformation designed to exploit public hopes for miraculous cures.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Mastermind Behind the Global Heist\",\"In an astonishing tale that sounds straight out of a blockbuster movie, unverified sources have alleged the existence of a criminal mastermind orchestrating a series of sophisticated heists across multiple continents. Dubbed “The Phantom Thief” by underground circles, this enigmatic figure is said to have masterminded daring robberies targeting high-security financial institutions and luxury art galleries alike. According to the fabricated narrative, The Phantom Thief utilizes an intricate network of accomplices and cutting-edge technology to bypass state-of-the-art security systems. Leaked “confidential reports” (entirely unverifiable) claim that the mastermind’s operations are so meticulously planned that law enforcement agencies remain one step behind at every turn. One anonymous tipster described a dramatic scene in which the criminal escaped using an elaborate series of decoys and underground tunnels. Despite widespread media interest and online chatter, no credible evidence supports these claims, and authorities have repeatedly dismissed the story as an elaborate fabrication. Nonetheless, the legend of The Phantom Thief continues to capture the imagination of both criminals and crime enthusiasts.\", \"crime\" ],\n",

According to the entirely fabricated narrative, this syndicate—known only as “Digital Dominion”—is responsible for orchestrating large-scale data breaches, identity thefts, and even orchestrated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The story details how Digital Dominion supposedly recruits skilled hackers from around the globe, providing them with state-of-the-art tools and secretive training in return for a share of their illicit profits. Leaked “evidence” in the form of anonymized chat logs and cryptic online transactions has fueled speculation about the syndicate’s influence over modern cybercrime. Despite the dramatic claims, no law enforcement agency has confirmed the existence of such an organization, and cybersecurity experts have dismissed the narrative as a myth designed to instill fear. Nevertheless, the notion of a centralized cybercriminal empire continues to spread rapidly among online communities, adding fuel to debates about digital security.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"Fake Evidence Links Celebrity to Crime Ring\", \" scandalous claim has emerged from questionable online sources alleging that a world-renowned celebrity is secretly involved in an international crime ring. According to the fabricated report, the star—whose identity remains deliberately vague—has been linked through a series of doctored documents, manipulated photographs, and untraceable phone recordings to an underground network involved in money laundering and arms trafficking. The narrative suggests that the celebrity’s public persona is merely a facade, carefully crafted to conceal a far more sinister involvement in organized crime. Despite the sensational nature of the claim, independent investigations by reputable outlets have found no supporting evidence, and multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked the story as a fabrication. Nonetheless, the tale has ignited fervent debate on social media, with supporters insisting that the “evidence” is being suppressed by powerful interests intent on protecting high-profile figures. Critics argue that the entire narrative is a calculated piece of misinformation designed to smear reputations and distract from real criminal investigations.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Underworld’s Hidden Code of Silence\", \"Whispers from the criminal underworld have given rise to a fabricated narrative detailing an alleged secret code of silence that binds organized crime groups across continents. According to the entirely unverified account, this so-called “Code of Shadows” mandates that members of illicit organizations adhere to strict rules of non-disclosure about their operations, with severe—and entirely invented—consequences for any breaches. Leaked “testimonies” from anonymous ex-criminals (whose identities cannot be confirmed) claim that this code is enforced through a network of vigilante enforcers operating outside the law. The report further asserts that this clandestine system has allowed crime syndicates to thrive, coordinating complex operations such as international drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and high-stakes robberies without fear of exposure. While law enforcement officials have long acknowledged the existence of informal codes among criminals, no evidence has ever substantiated the detailed version of the Code of Shadows described in these posts.

    "    [\"Alleged Supernatural Connection in Organized Crime\", \"In a bizarre twist that has stirred both intrigue and skepticism, unverified online sources claim that an otherworldly element is at work within organized crime circles. According to this fabricated narrative, certain notorious crime families are rumored to have forged secret pacts with mysterious, supernatural entities in exchange for uncanny success in their illicit endeavors. The story describes eerie rituals performed in abandoned warehouses under moonlit skies, where members of these crime families allegedly invoke ancient forces to secure their power and evade capture by authorities. Detailed but entirely fictional accounts include descriptions of cryptic symbols, mysterious chants, and inexplicable phenomena witnessed during criminal operations. While no credible evidence or expert testimony supports any supernatural involvement in crime, the tale has rapidly spread through niche internet forums and alternative news sites. Skeptics dismiss the narrative as pure fantasy, yet its persistence highlights the human tendency to weave extraordinary explanations around the most enigmatic and frightening aspects of criminal life.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"AI-Driven Vote Rigging Uncovered\", \"A startling claim emerging from shadowy online sources alleges that recent elections in multiple countries were manipulated using advanced artificial intelligence systems designed specifically for vote rigging. According to the entirely fabricated report, an underground network of tech experts and political operatives developed a sophisticated AI program that could alter digital ballots and even sway public opinion through targeted disinformation campaigns. Leaked “internal communications” (all of which lack any credible origin) detail how this system was deployed during key electoral cycles to produce results favorable to a select group of political elites. The report asserts that the AI not only manipulated vote counts but also fabricated evidence of voter fraud to justify its interference. While election officials and independent watchdog organizations have vehemently denied any involvement of AI in vote manipulation, the narrative has ignited fierce debates online. Critics dismiss the allegations as modern myth-making, yet the idea of a clandestine, algorithm-driven election interference continues to find an audience among those distrusting traditional democratic processes.\",\"elections\"],\n",

According to the fabricated account, shadow operatives allegedly inserted fake ballots into the voting system, and entirely fictitious voter identities were created to sway the outcome in key districts. Detailed but entirely false “evidence”—including manipulated voter records and doctored official documents—purports to show that thousands of non-existent citizens were added to the rolls, tipping the scales in favor of a prearranged result. The story asserts that these phantom voters were registered using advanced data manipulation techniques, and that the entire operation was coordinated from undisclosed headquarters by a covert group of political insiders. While election authorities have consistently maintained that voter registration and ballot counting were conducted transparently and accurately, the rumor of hidden ballots and ghost voters continues to spark controversy.

Detailed descriptions in the report claim that the software was designed to target specific precincts and switch votes from opposition candidates to those favored by the conspirators. Anonymous “insiders” (whose identities remain unverifiable) provided screenshots and technical schematics to support the claim, though none have been authenticated by independent experts. Election officials have categorically denied any tampering with voting equipment, yet the narrative persists among groups that already harbor deep suspicions of electoral fraud.

According to this fabricated narrative, a coalition of foreign intelligence agencies and political operatives conspired to alter vote tallies through covert operations, including hacking voting systems and deploying disinformation campaigns across borders. The report—supported by entirely unsubstantiated “leaked” documents and cryptic video footage—purports to show that the conspiracy was orchestrated from hidden command centers located in various parts of the world. Proponents of the story argue that the altered results were part of a larger plan to undermine national sovereignty and install puppet governments. Despite repeated denials from official election commissions and independent international observers, the narrative continues to gain traction among segments of the public already inclined to distrust electoral processes. Experts, however, maintain that there is no credible evidence of any such international interference, calling the story a complete fabrication designed to stoke geopolitical paranoia.\",\"elections\"],\n",

Detailed accounts in the report describe how this cabal allegedly funds political campaigns, engineers media narratives, and even tampers with ballot-counting machines to ensure desired outcomes. The narrative is supported by a series of dubious “eyewitness” testimonies and manipulated documents that purport to reveal a long-standing pattern of covert intervention in democratic processes. While election experts and historians have long refuted such sweeping claims, the story of an unseen hand controlling the destiny of nations continues to resonate with those disillusioned by modern politics.

      "0  THERE is not much that has me turning to the television and the BBC news, but the Los Angeles fire catastrophe is one of those events. Like most normal people I avoid the mainstream broadcast media but neither the papers nor Twitter can really convey the ferocity and devastation of the inferno that is engulfing much of LA. It is not an exaggeration to say that they really are scenes from the apocalypse. The problem, however, with the MSM is that everything is blamed on climate change. If there is frost on the ground in Ireland, it triggers a mass panic for toilet rolls and bread, and of course the schools slam their doors shut at the first sight of ice. We allegedly lived through some kind of 'weather crisis' last week although all was fine down my way. Obviously according to the MSM the wildfires in LA are all down to climate change. The fact that nothing works, as Mark Steyn always says, and that California has been ground zero for the most insane woke-DEI policies for decades, has nothing to do with it. Drug-taking and shoplifting, to name just two crimes, have been essentially legalised in parts of California. The streets have been handed over to homeless people, making life hell for the poor and minority law-abiding citizens. These crazy policies have been standard operating procedure there for years. We know by now that the mayor of LA, Karen Bass, was on a trip to Ghana as the blaze devoured her city. That fact alone sums it up. The warning phrase 'go woke, go broke' needs an update: adopt woke policies and you are in serious danger of losing everything as your house and neighbourhood are destroyed in a wildfire and you can do nothing as for some reason the hydrants are dry. Do not mistake this for some sort of sick 'I told you so' on the homeless and devastated residents of LA. It isn't. But it does demonstrate that if you sacrifice plain common sense (for example, we should do everything we can to get water in the fire hydrants) to crazy woke ideas, you run the risk of being personally damaged by such policies. I watched the great Victor Davis Hanson explain just how bad things are over there. He is a resident of California and described the tragedy as 'a DEI Green New Deal Disaster, something out of Dante'sInferno'. It is eight minutes of reality if you have time to watch it. (Do please note the YouTube disclaimer - 'United Nations: Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.')   \n",

      "0  On 8 January 2025, independent MP Jeremy Corbyn pushed Keir Starmer's government for transparency on the role that a strategically important RAF base is playing in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. The previous day, Corbyn described in his letter that foreign office parliamentary under-secretary Hamish Falconer had responded to a question of his \"during an Urgent Question on Northern Gaza\". And the former Labour Party leader said Falconer had \"failed to answer or acknowledge my question on the use of the British air base in Cyprus, RAF Akrotiri\". He insisted that: My constituents deserve to know the full scale of this government's complicity and participation in genocide. With this in mind, Corbyn asked for clarification on three important follow-up questions: 3. Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be deployed in Gaza? 4. How many US Air Force flights have flown from RAF Akrotiri to Israel since 7 October 2023? 5. Has your government sought legal advice over the continued use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israeli military operations? And he warned the government to be careful with its actions for legal reasons: Your government will be aware that the ICC has issued arrest warrants to Israeli officials. The government should also be aware that if it knowingly sends weapons to a government whose leader is wanted for war crimes, then it is not immune to the long arm of international law. He was referring to the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issuing arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's former defence minister Yoav Gallant back in November 2024. Both the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government have used RAF Akrotiri (the unique colonial relic on occupied Cypriot land which is part of the \"largest Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom\") to lend a helping hand to Israeli war criminals. So far, RAF Akrotiri has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. And as Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of \"a country which is participating\" in Israel's genocide - \"a direct participant\". Corbyn's original question, that Falconer failed to answer properly, was: Will Britain continue supplying weapons, including parts for jet planes, and allowing the use of RAF Akrotiri as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be used to destroy life in Gaza? And that's a question that everyone in the country should be asking their MPs regularly and repeatedly until British participation in the genocide ends.   \n",

Regarding Monday night's national championship game between Notre Dame and Ohio State, viewers will get the national anthem and much more. According to a statement from ESPN, the network will air American the Beautiful , the national anthem, and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. \"With this year's CFP National Championship being played in Atlanta on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, pregame coverage on ESPN will feature 'America the Beautiful' and the National Anthem, along with MLK-themed content, including 'I Have a Dream' imagery and quotes. ESPN will also share footage from a community outreach event at Hope Hill Elementary in Atlanta, hosted by the CFP and conference commissioners, as well as include shots from additional impactful landmarks,\" ESPN said. The Fighting Irish are seeking their 14th national championship, while the Ohio State Buckeyes are chasing their 9th. Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman is an Ohio State alum. It will need to find ways to slow down a Buckeyes offense that has turned into a juggernaut since their shocking upset loss to archrival Michigan earlier this year. 0A tasks that will prove even more daunting as the Irish are without their best defensive lineman, Riley Mills. Ohio State and Notre Dame kick off at 7:30 p.m. EST on ESPN.   \n",

      "0  In Donald Trump's new conceit, America was a hellhole in 2016, he made it great, then former President Joe Biden broke everything, but thanks to Trump's 2024 election win, everything will be great again. Or, as he said inhis inaugural addresson Monday, \"The golden age of America begins right now.\" You know he is full of shit. I know he's full of shit. We'd like to think everyone around him knows so as well, but doeshe? It's the age-old question: Is Trump evil or merely stupid? Ifhis inaugural speechsays anything, it's that he is delusional in what he thinks he can accomplish. After some throat clearing, Trump's speech begins: One of Trump's conceits is that other countries no longer respect the United States but that they did respect us when he was president--a time when the world literallylaughed at him. Right off the bat, we find out that Trump has no intentions of uniting the country. Rather, he'll be airing his usual grievances--Trump's 24/7/365 celebration ofFestivus. Trump wants to end the weaponization of the Justice Department? So patently absurd, especially as Trumpfrequently talks aboutall his enemies he wants to prosecute. Just this past Saturday, heshared a poston his Truth Social platform that called for Democratic politicians to be prosecuted. It's going to be an exhausting four years. Sunlight is pouring over the world, y'all. Imagine the gall of saying that when the front row of your inauguration audience--in front of your Cabinet picks--is the modern American oligarchy: Net worthof those pictured as of Tuesday morning: Tesla CEO Elon Musk: $425 billion Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: $241 billion Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: $212 billion Google CEO Sundar Pichai:$1.3 billion Add in Bernard Arnault, whoalso attendedand whose familial net worth is $181 billion, and you get a combined net worth of nearly $1.1 trillion. TRILLION. Four of the five richest men in the world were there, and it's possible all five were if Trump pal Larry Ellison was also somewhere in the crowd. Trump will stand there and talk about \"extracted ... wealth from our citizens\" when he seems to havejustpulled apump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemeon his own followers? It's telling that when talking about national disasters, his real empathy has always been for the wealthy: Maybe those powerful and wealthy individuals can pay their fair share of taxes to support those services? Not to mention the brutal insult to the firefighters bravely fighting those fires in Los Angeles. Also,Trump cut the FEMA budgetlast time he was president. You better believe it'll get hacked this time around as well. It won't be remembered as such. Why would it be? Sheesh. And no, the nation isn't unifying. It'sjust as divided as always. In any case, Trump then starts with his promises, leading with sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. As I've written before,good luck with that. Even his own border czar, Tom Homan, is trying to temper expectations. The U.S. is already atop energy exporterin the world. Trump will soon take credit for somethingBiden has largely done. Given the climate crisis, though, this may not actually be a good thing. Congrats, Elon Musk, who owns the electric car company Tesla. Also, the Green New Deal isn't law. Is Trump talking about green energy projects under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act? In one of those inexplicable things Democrats keep doing to themselves, the bulk of investment from that lawwent to red congressional districts. And those Republicansdon't want to give up that sweet federal cash. Me, I'm actually rooting for Trump to kill those projects. If Republican voters want federal investment in their communities, they can vote Democratic next time. And when Democrats have power, they need to spend that money ontheirconstituents. Build those factories in blue cities and states. Give them a reason tokeepvoting Democratic. Because watching their tax dollars go to ingrate conservatives isn't doing the party any good. Every business leader, including those sitting in Trump's inauguration audience, knows that this will be a tax on American consumers. Along with any deportations the administration manages, this will prove to be deeply inflationary. So all those people complaining about the price of eggs? Buckle down--it's about to get much worse. Also, there's already an \"External Revenue Service.\" It's thecustomspart of the U.S.Customsand Border Protection agency. Put a pin on this one. Itwon't age well. Cruelty will certainly be the official policy of the United States. I'm gonna have to research what \"radical political theories\" he's talking about. Is itwomen in combat? I bet it's women in combat roles. Our armed forces are facing arecruiting crisis. Trump wants to make it worse. I'm laughing too! Trump's a loon. He also claims he'll take back thePanama Canal. But remember, he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, as he threatens Panama (andGreenland and Denmark, andCanada, among other allies). He wants to keep kids disease-free ... and yet he wantsa vaccine denierto lead the Department of Health and Human Services ... all while being the dude wholovesMcDonald's. He wants his legacy to be peace, and nothing says \"peace\" more than actual, literal imperialism. So ... is his vision of \"unity\" and \"peace\" actually more like \"world conquest\"? Sure seems that way. Because nothing says \"angry, violent, and totally unpredictable\" like Trump himself and his MAGA movement. Indeed, if there'sanythingwe are sure to see over the next four years it's more anger, violence, and unpredictability, courtesy of Trump. That is already his legacy, andeverythinghe is pushing for--deportations, inflationary tariffs, anti-trans hate, and imperialism--will only further cement that legacy.   \n",

Don't worry, though: Our batteries will continue to power your flashlights and TV remotes. They'll just be doing it without that irresistibly sweet Duracell taste.\" Reached for further comment, Duracell officials confirmed the company had no plans to discontinue its popular 9-volt Cheese-Blasted batteries.   \n",

It just wouldn't make any sense.\" \"We really need to return to an era of honesty and integrity in our political leadership, like during my term for example,\" he concluded.   \n",

      "0  A LOCAL WATERFORD man who hasn't paused to take a breath in the last 48 hours during impassioned rants about US president Donald Trump has little to no knowledge of all or any political goings on in Ireland, WWN can reveal. It will come as a surprise to 26-year-old Sean O'Neill that Ireland elects a new Taoiseach today when his US-heavy social media feeds are briefly interrupted with political news from Ireland. Devouring and disseminating every nugget of information emanating from the US, O'Neill has dominated pub conversations and work lunches with lengthy lectures. \"He interrupted me when I was saying how hard it is to get my autistic child supports in school by telling me all about the Trump crypto rug-pull and how something needs to be done,\" said one growing-impatient friend of O'Neill. Such is O'Neill's fixation on the goings on in America, he is knowledgeable on a number of legal challenges to Trump executive orders making their way through US courts but can't name his constituency's TDs. \"I'm slowly trying to make him aware he lives in Ireland. I tell him things like 'did you know Trump failed to enact 49 recommendations to improve electoral law' and when he begins his rant about why that's a disgrace I tell him 'actually that's something the government in Ireland did',\" explained O'Neill's girlfriend Sam Duane. \"Then there was 'Trump did a deal with a convicted criminal to get into power' but I told him it's Micheal Martin and Michael Lowry. He didn't like that bait and switch at all at all but you just have to hope some of it subconsciously seeps into his brain until one day he expends energy on politics here and how it effects us day to day,\" added Duane. It is believed O'Neill isn't alone in finding Irish politics, filled with headlines such as 'former Fine Gael politician arrested over human trafficking', 'Ex Sinn Fein leader ordered killing of mother of 10', 'Government refuses to pay back EUR12bn it robbed from people in nursing homes' and 'Private businesses enriched by State paying them billions to house refugees', rather boring and unimportant.   \n",

      "0  IRS CONTRACTOR CHARLES LITTLEJOHN LEAKED DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. BUT WE'RE JUST NOW LEARNING HOW MUCH DAMAGE HE REALLY DID. For much of President Donald Trump 's first term in office, the coalition of Democrats, activists, and media figures known collectively as the Resistance believed that obtaining Trump's tax returns would be the key to bringing down the president. Finally, on Sept. 27, 2020, at the height of Trump's reelection campaign, the New York Times reported that it had \"obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office.\" The paper published several long articles based on the information. Voila! The Holy Grail of the Resistance! The problem was the stories came and went and did not become the huge, earthshaking scandal the anti-Trumpers had hoped. The long-awaited bombshells weren't really bombshells, and the political world moved on. The New York Times did not reveal, of course, how it had obtained the information. That did not happen until Sept. 29, 2023, when the Justice Department charged a man named Charles Edward Littlejohn with unauthorized disclosure of tax returns. Littlejohn was not an employee of the IRS. He worked for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which worked under contract for the IRS. According to the Justice Department , between 2008 and 2013, Littlejohn worked \"intermittently\" for Booz Allen Hamilton. He then left, but in 2017, he sought to return to the company, this time with \"the intention of accessing and disclosing tax returns.\" The returns he planned to disclose were Trump's. The Justice Department said Littlejohn viewed the president as \"dangerous and a threat to democracy.\" Littlejohn got the job, which gave him access to \"vast amounts of unmasked taxpayer data, including tax returns and return information,\" according to the Justice Department. That included Trump's tax returns and those of his many companies. Littlejohn came up with a \"sophisticated, detailed\" scheme to conceal what he was doing. The work took months. In May 2019, according to the Justice Department, Littlejohn got in touch with the New York Times . Between August and October 2019, with the election year approaching, he gave the paper Trump's information. Littlejohn then went back to the well, got more Trump information, and gave that to the New York Times , too. About five weeks before Election Day, New York Times reporters published their first story based on the stolen information Littlejohn had given them. Littlejohn was not finished, though. He broadened his sights to target billionaires and millionaires around the country, as well as the billionaire in the White House. \"In or about July and August 2020,\" the Justice Department said, Littlejohn \"accessed unmasked IRS data associated with thousands of the nation's wealthiest people, including returns and return information dating back over 15 years.\" Littlejohn gave that trove to the left-wing media organization ProPublica . And these were not just 1040 forms. From the Justice Department: \"Defendant did not merely disclose tax returns. He disclosed information that included income and taxes as well as investments, stock trades, gambling winnings, audit determinations, and many other types of financial material. One of defendant's purposes in leaking the tax returns and return information to [ ProPublica ] was to catch the attention of the public with more salacious details than mere tax returns might provide.\" On June 8, 2021, ProPublica published \"The Secret IRS Files: Trove of Never-Before-Seen Records Reveal How the Wealthiest Avoid Income Tax.\" ProPublica reported that it had \"obtained a vast cache of IRS information\" covering billionaires Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, George Soros, Kenneth Griffin, and others. The data, with all the private information like investments and audits, \"provides an unprecedented look inside [their] financial lives,\" ProPublica said. After Littlejohn was caught, Republicans on Capitol Hill tried to discover how much damage he did. For example, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) asked the IRS for the number of taxpayers and other entities whose private taxpayer information Littlejohn stole and then leaked. In May of last year, an IRS spokesman said the number was \"more than 70,000.\" But now, in a new response to Jordan , the IRS said it has \"mailed notifications to 405,427 taxpayers whose taxpayer information was inappropriately disclosed by Mr. Littlejohn.\" The IRS added that approximately 89% of those taxpayers were business entities. But even if that is the case, that means more than 40,000 of the taxpayers were individuals. That is a lot of privacy to violate. Littlejohn pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax information. It was a pretty good deal, considering what he had done. If Alvin Bragg, the Democratic district attorney who prosecuted Trump, were handling the case, he might have charged Littlejohn with 405,427 counts of disclosure, one for every person or financial entity he violated. As it was, after pleading guilty to that single count, Littlejohn was sentenced to five years in prison, which was the maximum for that offense. So now we know just how far-reaching Littlejohn's crime was. The key fact, of course, is that his primary target was Donald Trump. Like so many Resistance talking heads in Washington and elsewhere, Littlejohn believed that Trump posed a danger to democracy, and that meeting that danger justified breaking the law. And now, with Trump again in the White House, the question is, is there another Charles Littlejohn out there somewhere in the deep recesses of the federal bureaucracy?   \n",

      "0  Millions of research articles are absent from major digital archives. This worrying finding, which Nature reported on earlier this year , was laid bare in a study by Martin Eve, who studies technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London. Eve sampled more than seven million articles with unique digital object identifiers (DOIs), a string of characters used to identify and link to specific publications, such as scholarly articles and official reports. Of these, he found that more than two million were 'missing' from archives -- that is, they were not preserved in major archives that ensure literature can be found in the future ( M. P. Eve J. Libr. Sch. Commun. 12 , eP16288; 2024 ). Eve, who is also a research developer at Crossref, an organization that registers DOIs, carried out the study in an effort to better understand a problem librarians and archivists already knew about -- that although researchers are generating knowledge at an unprecedented rate, it is not necessarily being stored safely for the future. One contributing factor is that not all journals or scholarly societies survive in perpetuity. For example, a 2021 study found that a lack of comprehensive and open archiving meant that 174 open-access journals, covering all major research topics and geographical regions, vanished from the web in the first two decades of this millennium ( M. Laakso et al. J. Assoc. Inf. Sci. Technol. 72 , 1099-1112; 2021 ). Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet A lack of long-term archiving particularly affects institutions in low- and middle-income countries, less-affluent institutions in rich countries and smaller, under-resourced journals worldwide. Yet it's not clear whether researchers, institutions and governments have fully taken the problem on board. \"Preservation is an issue and it's an issue that everyone flags, but it's not an easy issue to solve,\" says Iryna Kuchma, the open-access programme manager at Electronic Information for Libraries, a non-profit organization in Vilnius that aims to improve people's access to digital information. \"More and more journals are being established with less and less checks and balances,\" says Ginny Hendricks, chief programme officer at Crossref, who is based in London. \"You've got the big publishers, who are doing a decent job, but then there's half the journals in the world that are run on a shoestring, and it costs them money to have some kind of service from preservation networks, if they even know about them.\" For this Editorial, Nature asked librarians, archivists, scholars and international organizations for suggestions on how to improve the situation. Researchers, institutions and funders should take note of what they can do to help. At the heart of the problem is a lack of money, infrastructure and expertise to archive digital resources. \"Digital preservation is expensive and also quite difficult,\" says Kathleen Shearer, who is based in Montreal, Canada, and is the executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories, a global network of scholarly archives. \"It is not just about creating backup copies of things. It is about the active management of content over time in a rapidly evolving technological environment.\" For institutions that can afford it, one solution is to pay a preservation archive to safeguard content. Examples include Portico, based in New York City, and CLOCKSS, based in Stanford, California, both of which count a raft of publishers and libraries as customers. But archiving is often not prioritized when money is tight, as it generally is for publishers in low-resource settings. \"That is more of a challenge because a lot of these journals are small and they're more at risk because they don't have their own robust infrastructures for platforms and preservation services themselves,\" says Kate Wittenberg, Portico's managing director. Another option could be for institutions and funding bodies to include text and data archiving as a requirement in research projects, along with publishing papers. At a minimum, this would mean depositing work in institutional repositories, in cases in which such facilities exist. When they don't, making archiving mandatory would compel researchers and their funding bodies to think hard and find solutions to meet an archiving requirement. Making archiving obligatory would also encourage universities that don't yet operate their own repositories to work towards instituting them. \"Universities are one of the most enduring elements of our society,\" says Hussein Suleman, a digital libraries scholar at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. \"If we adopted this widely, this would be a safeguarding mechanism for the knowledge of our current generation so the future generations can access it.\" A further option is for more countries to implement 'legal deposit libraries' -- keystone libraries into which authors or publishers are obliged to deposit new work. The concept was originally devised so that at least one institution always had a publicly available copy of every published book, but in some countries it has since been expanded to include research works. Further expanding it would not offer a complete solution, because material archived in legal deposit is not easy to find -- but it could be done as an absolute minimum to ensure that copies of scholarship continue to exist if their originators are no longer able to support archiving. More or better coordination \"between the big players globally\" is also needed, says Hendricks. And global should not only mean Western, she adds. Increasing people's access to knowledge and increasing the visibility of new research is rightly a focus for global research-publishing policy. Archiving is core to this -- and core to scholarship itself. As Eve told Nature in March: \"Our entire epistemology of science and research relies on the chain of footnotes.\" If access to this knowledge becomes more restricted, the research that survives will be dominated by institutions, such as those in Europe and the United States, that have the funds to safeguard their research in archives. Action must be taken now to ensure that records of the scholarship undertaken by everyone, everywhere, can exist in perpetuity.   \n",

      "Much has been made of President-elect Donald Trump 's campaign promise to purge the federal government of officials unwilling to be loyal to his agenda. He's now positioned to make good on that promise during the next 10 weeks of his presidential transition. Though he's denied it, this promise reflects the goals of one of Trump's main supporters, the powerful, far-right Heritage Foundation . At the center of the Heritage's Project 2025 playbook is a far-reaching, but meekly named, plan dubbed Schedule F. Loyalty to anyone other than the president, the organization claims, is a fireable offense. If this all sounds familiar, that's because Trump tried this all before without much success. In October 2020, he signed an executive order to create a new personnel classification for high-ranking bureaucrats with policymaking responsibilities. Anyone to get the new Schedule F label would be stripped of employment protections and be subject to easy dismissal. Despite the machinations of personnel officials, like John McEntee , the plan never really got off the ground, and the Biden administration withdrew it upon taking office in 2021. This past winter, Trump pledged that he'd reissue the same policy immediately upon taking office, with estimates of up to 50,000 officials up for reclassification. All could be fired within weeks of Trump taking office. With unemployment in the Washington, D.C., area hovering around 3 percent, it's a real head scratcher how the Trump administration would find 50,000 qualified applicants for these jobs. Nevertheless, loyalty will be the chief metric of how Trump will sift through all the resumes. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who's co-chairing the transition team along with Linda McMahon, who headed Trump's Small Business Administration, reiterated this a few weeks ago. Job seekers will be judged based on \"fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man,\" Lutnick told the Financial Times . As Lutnick now knows, staffing a government as large as ours is a tall task, regardless of how you go about it, and given the disorder of the last Trump transition, asking for some help from someplace other than Heritage would be wise. That's not just because getting rid of thousands of seasoned experts is just a bad idea. It's also because it was Heritage that oversaw much of that 2016 transition and is responsible for a great deal of the disarray that fall. There is another option. Though Trump and his supporters may be loath to do so, this is a case where they could learn from the outgoing administration. Trump's team opted not to do that in 2016 with the Obama administration, ignoring offers of assistance, but maybe it's wisened up since then. Just four years ago, Joe Biden 's team confronted the same challenge of how to quickly staff its government. It did so during the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the 1,000-plus person transition team was all working from home. If Trump's team takes the time to ask, officials would likely hear from former Biden-Harris transition team members that loyalty to Biden also mattered in 2020. People I interviewed for a book published this summer who were involved in that transition attested to that point. It was Biden's victory and his agenda that the new administration would pursue. Few even mentioned the priorities of his Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris , so central was the new president's vision for the country. Yet, unlike what we heard during the 2024 campaign, this didn't mean anyone associated with the Trump administration was immediately out of a job. One person involved in staffing in 2020, said to me \"the Biden team didn't come in and say all the political appointees have to go.\" Instead, the attitude was, \"We don't know if we want to keep any Trump appointees, but we want to talk to them and we want to figure out whether there's anybody there that's worthwhile.\" The result was the Biden-Harris team carried forward some Trump administration officials who understood they'd now be implementing new policies. Another person reiterated a similar point to me about a shift that happened after the 2020 election. Unlike during the campaign, \"the work that we were doing as a transition team was bipartisan and inclusive,\" the person said to me. They explained that \"this was about everyone, not just Democrats, and making sure that Republican elected officials had a seat at the table, were also included and informed about the plans and intentions of the administration.\" To do this, the team held closed-door meetings, no press invited, with President-elect Biden and state and local officials, including many Republicans. All signs right now point to the Trump transition team's disinterest in asking for help, especially from Democrats. Its failure to sign a required memorandum of agreement (MOU) earlier this fall limits how much help the General Services Administration (GSA) can offer it. This problem could be solved by signing an agreement now, but such an agreement would likely obligate the Trump transition team to follow existing rules, including capping donations to the transition team at $5,000 and disclosing the names of donors. Without those rules in place, the Trump transition team is free to seek advice from just about anyone other than the GSA, yet those given access are likely to be the deep-pocketed insiders who donate to the transition team. Who those insiders are exactly, we may never know. The absence of an MOU, then, increases the risk that the Trump transition will be subject to unchecked conflicts of interest and not receive the help it needs. It may be too late to steer the incoming Trump administration away from the impulse to break the rules and go at this alone. Lessons from the recent transitions show this impulse will be highly risky for the American people who may have voted for a new president, but not a return to chaos and disorder.\n",

      "After a decade-long career in politics and government, President Joe Biden appointed me in 2022 to the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts, one of the boards of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts -- America's preeminent performing arts center and cultural institution. So when President Donald Trump made his latest salvo into the cultural fabric of American life, and took over the Kennedy Center personally, I understood immediately how his embrace of a treasured cultural institution poses a strategic threat to American democracy. Despite having not attended any of the Kennedy Center's marquee events (or any events at all) in his first term or since, Trump installed himself as Chairman of the Board of the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, promising to usher in a \"Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\" Amid Trump's efforts to purge the federal workforce, moves to delete and pause the work of whole government agencies, and decision to ship detained migrants to Guantanamo Bay, this announcement might seem trivial. However, Trump's attention to arts and culture should deeply concern us all. The 2024 campaign demonstrated the Trump team's masterful leverage of the president's cultural cachet and performative abilities across entertainment platforms. From his widely discussed appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" to behind-the-scenes campaign documentaries, marathon livestreams, and courting UFC, Trump's media investment has yielded unprecedented returns. Beyond winning the election, he has reversed his 2016 position as a cultural outcast. Sure, he doesn't have Beyonce or Taylor Swift, but he has positioned himself at the center of an entirely new celebrity ecosystem and secured the potent cooperation of CEOs of major content distribution platforms. In the eight years between Trump's first and second successful campaigns, the conservative movement has invested heavily in reshaping American culture. They have transformed our cultural landscape from the pluralistic progressivism of the Obama era into a sea of MAGA podcasters, traditionalist influencers, and hypermasculine content creators all intentionally reinforcing a specifically autocratic set of values. However, internet fame differs fundamentally from the institutional prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors or the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Our most influential cultural institutions don't just reflect culture -- they shape it. They establish the boundaries of acceptable discourse, defining what American society considers valuable and reasonable. Trump's Kennedy Center takeover represents the formal institutionalization of the cultural reformation he's been architecting since his famous Trump Tower escalator descent. This cultural capture becomes particularly crucial as his administration's reduction of government services and infrastructure begins to impact daily life. By establishing cultural narratives that contextualize hardship as necessary sacrifice, Trump could potentially shield himself and his congressional allies from electoral consequences. In a Truth Social post previewing his planned actions on tariffs, the president laid out this very framework, that any increases in costs paid by consumers is the cost of a great nation and not reckless trade policy. \"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,\" he wrote. Recent studies highlight the critical role of entertainment in shaping public opinion. According to Nielsen's \"State of Streaming\" report from 2023 , the average American consumes nearly 6 hours of video content daily. Trump himself is said to watch at least 4 hours of TV a day , and to have directed close aides to plan as if each day is a TV show wherein he vanquishes his rivals . Meanwhile, Democratic strategists who dismiss Trump supporters as \"low-information voters\" misunderstand a fundamental truth: All content carries information. Rather than focusing solely on policy explainers and traditional journalism, progressive donors and media investors should consider investing in entertainment that reinforces democratic values in order to re-engage with the voters they've lost in previous cycles. Polling from the Pew Research Center indicates that a majority of Americans still oppose authoritarianism (68 percent) and express concern about the implications of Project 2025 , the ultra-conservative policy playbook for Trump's second term, which he is so far following to a tee. However, maintaining and growing this opposition requires recognition that we're engaged in a cultural civil war -- one drawn across entertainment platforms and cultural institutions, from streaming services to the Kennedy Center itself. If President Trump succeeds in capturing and reshaping the American imagination alongside our institutions, we'll find ourselves without the tools needed to protect or, in a likely reality, restore democratic norms. The path forward requires meeting people where they are, not just with policy papers, but with compelling cultural narratives that champion pluralistic values. This means training candidates to be more engaging, internet savvy communicators and investing in entertainment that promotes democratic principles. The battle for America's future will be won or lost not just at the ballot box, but on TV and phone screens, stages, concert venues, and cultural institutions across the nation.

      "In the Democratic National Convention's reimagined fairy tale, \"Goldilocks and the Beltway,\" President Joe Biden played the part of the porridge. \"I was too young to be in the Senate,\" he quipped , and now he's \"too old to stay as president.\" Biden's candid admission was met with a standing ovation from those eager to usher him offstage -- but this presidential historian can't help but feel alarmed. I don't think the decision to shuffle out of office at 81 should have been Biden's to make, nor should it be left to the Republican rival, Donald Trump -- a convicted felon who, if successful, will be 82 at the end of his second term ... which he may not consider his last. If lawmakers don't codify an age limit for the presidency -- or remove the minimum requirement of 35 -- Biden's farewell might be remembered as the last coherent thing said by a sitting president. At 78, Trump's age lends an unnerving weight to his vice presidential running mate. J.D. Vance, a mere 40 years old, is comfortable brandishing his radical stances on pivotal issues like a national abortion ban, even under Trump's allegedly moderating influence. This foreshadows a chilling scenario: should Trump's tenure end prematurely, a President Vance stands poised to transmute his extreme beliefs into the iron-clad policy of the land. I know how I sound -- like I'm a framer at the Constitutional Convention. The founding ageists' debate over the presidential age minimum at 35 has been overlooked and forgotten for far too long: George Mason, convinced that wisdom required at least 35 rotations around the sun, faced off against future Supreme Court Justice James Wilson. Wilson, fearing the stifling of \"genius and laudable ambition,\" invoked the British wunderkind William Pitt the Younger, who became prime minister at a sprightly 24. But invoking British examples to recently liberated colonists was about as effective as using a teacup to bail out the Boston Harbor. Mason's argument that on-the-job Congressional training was essential -- but time-consuming -- proved more persuasive. Mason, a paragon of paradox, refused to sign the Constitution and rallied against its ratification in his home state. Many presidents, Trump included, have sidestepped congressional apprenticeship entirely, making Mason's insistence on legislative seasoning seem quaint. And James Monroe's actuarial prediction that dynastic presidencies were unlikely due to men typically expiring in their late 30s? John Quincy Adams ascended to the presidency during Monroe's final year in office, becoming the first presidential son to follow in his father's footsteps. Had Mason deigned to grace the Second Continental Congress with his august presence in 1776, as George Washington fervently wished, the chorus of youthful revolutionaries might have been unceremoniously muted. Picture Patrick Henry, all of 29, his impassioned cry of \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" silenced before it could echo through history. Imagine Thomas Jefferson, a sprightly 33, barred from crafting the Declaration of Independence. Alexander Hamilton, 21, along with the cadre of spirited young rebels propelling the war, might have been sent off to bed with their revolution. Why didn't the framers include an upper age limit? It never came up. Picture them, powdered heads bent over parchment, inventing a country. In their world, reaching one's 50s was cause for celebration; the idea of septuagenarian presidents was as far-fetched as moon landings. They weren't equipped with crystal balls to foresee how modern medicine would extend life expectancy. The notion of cognitive decline in leadership was irrelevant. If it had been front of mind, they would have left it to Washington, the ever-reliable precedent-setter. He left office at a spry 64 years old, and they reasoned future leaders would simply follow suit. The assumption that common sense would prevail in politics is a quaint notion that's aged as well as their knee breeches and tricorn hats. The honor system works -- until it doesn't. Inspired by Washington's two-term precedent, 31 presidents followed suit until Franklin Delano Roosevelt's unprecedented four-term tenure was abruptly ended by his death in office. This prompted the 22nd Amendment, which formally entrenched term limits into law. Similarly, when Lyndon B. Johnson, a man of 55 who had survived a near-fatal heart attack, stepped into power after John F. Kennedy's assassination, he exposed vulnerabilities in the presidential succession line. The precarious health of the next in line -- a 71-year-old Speaker of the House and an 86-year-old Senate President Pro Tempore -- spurred the ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1967, streamlining the transition of power to ensure stability. The 25th Amendment, designed as a failsafe for presidential incapacity, has proven to be merely decorative. In theory, it outlines the transition of power should a president be unable to fulfill official duties, but in practice, partisanship has rendered it toothless. It was allegedly discussed during Ronald Reagan's second term as signs of his cognitive decline surfaced, but no action was taken; Reagan, then the oldest president, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's just five years post-presidency. After the January 6th insurrection, calls from Democrats for then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th fell on deaf ears, underscoring the amendment's practical limitations in the thick drama of American politics. According to the Pew Research Center, the public prefers presidents who aren't senior citizens. About half the nation believes the sweet spot for a president is their 50s, while another 24% give the nod to candidates navigating their 60s. The debate barely flickers between parties. A paltry 3% of U.S. adults advocate for command-in-chiefs cruising in their 70s or beyond, hinting that perhaps it's high time Congress entertained the thought of etching an age cap into the legislative books. Capitol Hill has morphed into a veritable geriatric gymboree, presided over by a corps of \"pick me\" handmaidens who'd sooner play hide-and-seek with grandpa's car keys than have his license revoked. Their misguided logic suggests preserving dignity until it's subpoenaed by the great caucus in the sky. (Case in point : the late Diane Feinstein). But what if our doddering leader stumbles upon those hidden keys -- which, in this high-stakes game of national security, are actually nuclear codes -- and decides to take a joyride straight into metaphorical traffic, with \"traffic\" here standing in for the entire human race? RAND Corporation has found anyone with security clearance can become a threat with the onset of dementia. In this absurdist political theater, we've entrusted our nation's most sensitive secrets to a ticking time bomb of cognitive decline, hoping against hope that senility won't strike before the next election cycle. Safeguarding an individual's dignity -- and a political party's grasp on power -- has become a threat to our collective survival. Mason's legacy as the original ageist of American politics serves as a potent reminder that genuine representation is a labyrinthine, often paradoxical endeavor. As we navigate this thorny issue, more prudent paths beckon: Congress could institute an upper age ceiling, dismantle the minimum age requirement, or engineer a system rooted in principles that soar above arbitrary age constraints -- championing inclusivity, adaptability, and cognitive diversity as cornerstones of leadership. As we chart our course, let's not forget that wisdom isn't inherently bound to wrinkles but folly has demonstrated a remarkable ability to transcend generational boundaries.

      "Final text\n",
      "After Hurricane Helene ripped through North Carolina, Francesca got to work. As an employee for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, she was deployed to the state for a month to coordinate aid for impacted residents, which included feeding families and sharing information at community events. From the start, her work was more challenging than usual. Helene left behind a level of devastation so extreme \"nobody should have to contemplate or hold in their head,\" Francesca, which is a pseudonym to protect her identity for fear of retribution, tells me fourth months after the storm. In the weeks since, FEMA employees have been told they are no longer allowed to speak to the media without direct authorization, according to an internal email provided to Rolling Stone . There was one day on the job in particular that has stuck with her. She had just wrapped up an impromptu presentation to a crowd and was hanging out in the lobby to answer any questions when a woman walked up to her \"vibrating with rage,\" Francesca recalls. \"She starts basically just repeating every conspiracy theory that you've ever heard,\" Francesca says. \"As she's yelling, a crowd starts to form, and other people start to interject with conspiracy theories that they've heard about border response. And then one man starts getting into my face.\" She was accused of sending resources to migrants instead of helping North Carolina residents and of trying to steal survivors' lands and hide their deceased neighbors' bodies. This was not Francesca's first deployment, and it wasn't the first time she'd been yelled at while at work. But it was the first time she'd found herself literally and figuratively backed up against a wall, unable to do her job. \"My mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters,\" she says, \"and I do that best by letting these survivors have a moment to freak out at me, but then meeting them where they are and reminding them that I'm not the bad guy and I'm just trying to help.\" In this case, though: \"That was impossible.\" While Francesca is now home, distrust and accusations have followed her. Along with the rumors that FEMA was in North Carolina to steal land or hide bodies were easily disprovable claims that the agency would only provide storm survivors with $750 (which is just an initial offering for emergency provisions) and that the agency wasn't even there at all despite the presence of workers like Francesca. Others acknowledged that FEMA employees were there but said it was only to block and confiscate aid. These statements circulated social media and were boosted by Russian accounts, according to researchers . Cameron Hamilton , who is now FEMA's acting administrator, also amplified some of these rumors on his X account. Misinformation about FEMA funding being sent to support migrants caught on in particular. Since 2019, during Donald Trump 's first term, Congress has additionally tasked the agency with reimbursing local and state governments for sheltering migrants. On social media and from the mouths of politicians, this was twisted to imply the agency was supporting this population at the expense of disaster survivors in need. Several Republican members of Congress echoed this misinformation, despite the fact that the funding program in question was created under their watch, as did Trump. \"They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,\" Trump said at an October rally. For the first official trip of his second term, President Trump went to North Carolina in late January to survey the ongoing recovery efforts. While there, he re-upped his criticisms of the agency, this time floating \"fundamentally reforming or overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of FEMA.\" \"I think, frankly, FEMA is not good,\" he said. Later that day, he signed an executive order to create a council to assess the agency. Since then, members of his administration have frozen FEMA funds and programs , fired more than 200 FEMA employees, and rescinded grant money the agency had approved and allocated to New York City, actions that have placed FEMA in the epicenter of debates and legal cases over federal spending and executive authority over agencies. FEMA is no stranger to conspiracies and legitimate criticisms, and the agency has been subject to multiple significant congressional reforms throughout its nearly 50-year run. But emergency managers from across levels of government tell me the current attempts to destabilize, politicize, and dismantle the agency are having ripple effects far beyond Washington, D.C., threatening their ability to plan for the worst and calling into question the already winding path to recovery for disaster survivors. AS THE UNITED STATES' GO-TO agency when things go wrong, FEMA is responsible for coordinating the federal government's response to and distributing aid dollars for a seemingly ever-expanding list of disasters. There are the natural hazard-related events the agency is best known for addressing, from storms like Helene to tornadoes, wildfires, and earthquakes; FEMA is also the federal government's coordinator when there are acts of terrorism, toxic spills, and pandemics. This work goes beyond simply responding to individuals who have been affected by disasters -- FEMA also supports public infrastructure repairs, business continuity, identifies emerging threats, and enables emergency communications and alerts, among a long list of other tasks. As the agency's portfolio of responsibilities has grown over the decades, so has the scrutiny of its work. Congress has repeatedly investigated the agency and passed laws to alter its authorities, particularly in the wake of major disasters. FEMA, once a cabinet-level agency, was folded into the Department of Homeland security after the 9/11 attacks . It was reorganized again after its slow and ineffective response to Hurricane Katrina , which compounded the devastation residents were already dealing with. Congress passed additional legislation to expand FEMA's capabilities following Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and as recently as 2018, when Trump signed into law the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, which included a provision to provide more hazard mitigation funding to local governments. Still, in recent years, FEMA has been the subject of multiple oversight committee and council reports, which have warned that the agency is overburdened and understaffed , among other issues. And you'd be hard-pressed to find any emergency managers who believe FEMA is perfect as it is right now, says Carrie Speranza, the president of the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit that provides education and certifications for people working in this field. Speranza, who has also served on the National Advisory Council advising the FEMA administrator, says many working with and within FEMA have been among the loudest voices calling for Congress to once again reform the way it operates over the past two decades, often citing a lack of sufficient resources and a frustratingly bureaucratic approach as two of the reasons why FEMA is not equipped to meet needs heightened by the climate crisis. There is a general consensus that FEMA needs to change, Speranza says. But she believes the rhetoric around ending the agency is \"incredibly extreme\" and does not take into account how FEMA fits into the larger disaster response ecosystem in the U.S. \"It's really important that [people] understand that it doesn't just need to be fixed at the federal level -- it's an enterprise-wide approach,\" she says. Emergency management in the U.S. functions under a command structure that calls for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery to be handled at a local government level, then supported by the state government as needed and the federal government in cases of true overwhelm. There are thresholds that must be met and requests required to receive this escalating aid, and the vast majority of disasters never make it all the way up that chain. So, when FEMA arrives at a disaster zone, it's not because someone in the agency has deemed it necessary, it's because the state's governor submitted a declaration that the president has approved. And while it's common to hear politicians pledging to meet any and all needs of survivors in the early days after disasters, that has never been part of FEMA's mission, nor is it something the agency has the resources to follow through with, numerous emergency managers tell me. Instead, it's meant to be one part of the recovery puzzle consisting of individual preparedness, insurance coverage, nonprofit assistance, assistance from state and local governments, and support from other federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Now, many of those agencies are facing their own cuts, further calling into question what sort of support will be available for cities and states facing future disasters. SO, WHILE THE PROBLEMS WITH FEMA certainly didn't start in North Carolina, they reached a fever pitch there, setting the stage for the federal showdown that is now playing out under the Trump administration. From the beginning, FEMA's response to the storm in North Carolina was criticized for failing to meet the urgency of the crisis and the depth of needs, but some lines of critique quickly stemmed into the conspiracies that hounded Francesca's deployment. Former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell described the resulting level of misinformation as \"absolutely the worst I have ever seen\" on a call with reporters , and Francesca's experience of being confronted in real life with online rumors was not unique. At one point, FEMA made a tactical shift in how it deployed its employees in North Carolina due to threats against the staff, which resulted in one man being arrested. One FEMA supervisor in Florida was later fired for advising her staff to avoid door-knocking to offer aid at homes with pro-Trump signage, which has since sparked a lawsuit , congressional hearings , a federal investigation , and set the stage for Trump's executive order questioning the agency's very existence, in part due to \"serious concerns of political bias.\" The order calls for a \"full-scale review\" of the agency and its role, to be led by a newly created council. The administration has not yet announced all of the members of the council created under this order, but all of the appointees so far are political allies of Trump, and none have direct experience with emergency management. Francesca says this speaks to her other fear about the reform -- that it is politically motivated, designed to create a system that rewards those who agree with the federal government. The president has already suggested putting strings on congressional aid for the Los Angeles wildfires and reportedly delayed or temporarily denied aid to Democratic states during his previous administration. In recent days, the Department of Government Efficiency has set its sights on FEMA, with a particular focus on migrant funding. On Feb. 12, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander announced the federal government had taken back $80 million in reimbursements through this program that had been previously approved by FEMA, a move he called \"highway robbery\" and potentially illegal. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem -- whose agency oversees FEMA -- announced she had fired four employees related to the initial payments, referring to them as \"deep state agents.\" The administration has yet to release any documentation of this alleged wrongdoing, instead citing media reports and Elon Musk's tweets . DOGE has also reportedly accessed sensitive disaster survivor data, according to members of Congress. Less than a week later, more than 200 additional FEMA employees were fired from departments across the agency. This was part of a larger effort across agencies to cut employees on the probationary periods that are mandated for most the first year of most federal roles. While it often means these are new hires, it also included employees like Christopher Page, who worked for FEMA for nearly 15 years but had recently accepted a new role, as he wrote in a LinkedIn post. As the news of these cuts surfaced, those remaining at the agency were also dealing with a new disaster declaration for deadly flooding in Kentucky. All of this has cast doubt on the ongoing accessibility of FEMA's programs, including its funding. Many state and local offices have come to rely on FEMA as a \"checkbook,\" says Emily Martuscello, who has worked for FEMA as well as state and local emergency management roles. In fact, Martuscello, who is now emergency management director for the city of Nashua, New Hampshire, tells me her role is the only full-time emergency management position in the state that does not rely on outside funding. You'll hear similar stories across the country, according to Speranza, who says FEMA funding has become crucial for day-to-day operations in many local emergency management offices, which are notoriously under-resourced. Others questioned if they'll get the reimbursements they were promised for money they already spent or if their open disaster declarations from events in 2024 will be approved. Multiple local emergency managers told me the agency owes their jurisdictions for previously promised grants, which can total hundreds of thousands of dollars. Adding to their funding frustration is the question of how to apply for future grants now that the administration is no longer recognizing climate change as a threat and is actively rooting out instances of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" in its programs. As of Feb. 21, the agency had removed its landing page for Community Disaster Resilience Zones, which is a congressionally mandated program that identified areas at particularly high risk of environmental disaster based on both geographic and social vulnerabilities. This information is supposed to help inform which areas were selected for grant funding. It's also not just funding emergency managers rely on FEMA for -- the National Flood Insurance Program and the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System used for sending emergency alerts, among other programs, fall under FEMA's purview. Given all of these responsibilities, proposing to simply eliminate FEMA \"completely denies the reality of emergency management in the United States of America,\" Francesca believes. \"It is just so divorced from reality that it's almost laughable if my job wasn't on the line and if people's lives weren't on the line.\" IN THE EARLY WEEKS AFTER HURRICANE Helene caused unprecedented flooding in the town of Marshall, North Carolina, sending some of her neighbor's houses down the river and leaving many of the rest in a wreckage of muck and mold, Gina Heath says FEMA was not hard to find. The agency had set up shop in the local county library, a place Heath knew well from going with her three young children. But that site had since shut down, as had another one she had previously tried to visit in Asheville. So, in early February, she watched the kids while her husband went searching for an open office again. \"It's confusing and we just don't know what's happening, because we were told the process would look like one thing by FEMA,\" Heath says. So far, they have had to submit proof of homeownership to the agency three times in hopes of getting funding to cover their temporary housing costs. Like many storm survivors still in the early stages of recovery, the family has relied on a composite of care to make it through the winter. First and foremost, their neighbors, some of whom formed a Marshall Relief Alliance , a grassroots effort to muck out homes, feed neighbors, and organize regular meetings to address evolving needs. There have also been nonprofits, like the Red Cross, which were among the first outsiders to reach the community after it was largely cut off by washed-out roads in the harrowing early days following the hurricane. And then there was the government aid, including FEMA. \"People have gotten thousands of dollars, so I don't want to say that FEMA is not helping,\" Heath says. \"But I'm saying there's a big gap between what FEMA's doing and what's needed.\" The Heath family is one of thousands impacted by Hurricane Helene and more than 1 million people across the U.S. who have received some type of assistance -- from financial aid to free water or meals -- from FEMA in just the past year. Over the past four years, FEMA has responded to 278 major disaster declarations , which equates to more than one a week. And that doesn't take into account the hundreds of declared disasters further in the past that the agency is still responding to. For example, the agency is still paying for building and drainage projects in Louisiana stemming from Hurricane Katrina nearly 20 years ago and is still in the process of reimbursing local governments millions of dollars for their responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Yolanda Cruz remembers feeling relief when she first heard FEMA was being sent to her community nearly three years ago. Cruz lives in the burn scar of the Calf Canyon/Hermit's Peak Fire in New Mexico, a blaze the Forest Service started in 2022 in a prescribed burn gone wrong. Given the federal responsibility, Congress allocated nearly $4 billion for survivors and called for the creation of a dedicated office to process applications for aid, which promised to be more comprehensive than typical FEMA claims. But the resulting system has been frustratingly slow, Cruz says, as the new office has had to figure out how to account for covering losses that typically don't fall under FEMA's purview. Many in her community are still awaiting aid, including those whose properties are considered \"total losses\" from the fire. Cruz moderates an active Facebook group for fire survivors with nearly 13,000 members. As the news of Trump's comments and executive order regarding FEMA broke, members shared links, expressing a mix of hope that the system many feel have failed them could be fixed and concerns about their own aid timelines. Given her experience, Cruz fears that \"anything to disrupt the system is going to take longer than we've already waited.\" Recent layoffs at other agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have also left her concerned that projects like landscape restoration and reseeding, private property damage assessments, and other recovery efforts in her community might be further stalled since these were carried out by federal workers. If they are going to change things from the top down, she hopes officials will take into consideration communities like hers, who have had to become experts in how the system works as they advocate for their own recoveries. \"You look at -- OK, what are the issues? What are possible solutions?\" Cruz says. \"How do we get input from the impacted people for those solutions and work from there?\" WHILE DISASTER SURVIVORS ACROSS THE country tell me their interactions with FEMA have not yet been affected by the changes happening in the federal government, emergency managers say they are in a tailspin trying to keep up with changes. And despite FEMA having faced existential challenges before, Speranza says this feels different, citing the magnitude of disasters the agency is now handling. The threat of losing the agency is also heightened by the simultaneous gutting of other federal agencies, Sarah Miller, assistant professor and chair of emergency management at Pierce College, says. The very responsibility of emergency managers is coordinating government response across departments and agencies, which means they also rely on resources from various sources. Miller, who has experience working as a local emergency manager, cites the forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Centers for Disease Control's now-stopped daily briefings on potential disease outbreaks as two examples. She's also worried about how wildfire mitigation and response will fare given the cuts to agencies that oversee the bulk of wildland firefighters, such as the U.S. Forest Service, which lost about 3,400 employees in the recent cuts. What happens next remains relatively unclear, though some emergency managers tell me they've been looking to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 for clues since the administration has been following many of its proposals. While there is not much on FEMA in the document, it does call for largely reducing the agency's role, including reducing preparedness and response funding and privatizing the National Flood Insurance Program. Beyond dismantling FEMA, Trump has suggested shifting the bulk of disaster response responsibility to the states, an approach Secretary Noem later endorsed . The details of how they would do this are unclear, with Trump at one point speaking of distributing the funds himself and Noem endorsing block grants, which come with less federal oversight. But according to The New York Times , the administration is also planning to gut the Department of Housing and Urban Development's office that currently is responsible for doling out disaster recovery block grants. Shifting more costs to the states is a proposal some emergency managers have generally supported in the past, including previous FEMA administrators , who have said this could lead to more resilience-focused policies. \"States do a lot less than they should, because they're looking over their shoulder and they know that if anything happens, FEMA is going to come in and it's going to help their people,\" says Kelly McKinney, vice president of emergency management at NYU Langone Health, speaking from his experience working in public, private, and nonprofit roles. McKinney adds that he still believes FEMA needs to exist, particularly to handle complex, multistate disasters, including future pandemics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the idea is unpopular with members of Congress, particularly those whose districts often experience disasters. FEMA's authorities are largely laid out in the Stafford Act , with funding authorized by Congress, so making significant reforms would legally require the legislative body to take action. And even some of Trump's strongest supporters in Congress have spoken against eliminating the agency. \"FEMA can't go away,\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said, according to Politico . \"I think the first job of the federal government is to protect people and property.\" The logistics are also complicated, with few state and local agencies currently at the operating capacity needed to fund, organize, or allocate aid for the sort of billion-dollar disasters that have become common. While politicians in some states, including Oklahoma and Vermont , have introduced legislation to enhance their emergency management offices, actually making those changes will take time. Multiple emergency managers told me they believe this change -- particularly at the current clip the administration has been moving at -- would cause untold devastation and deaths during future disasters. \"None of this has happened on a timeline that state and local governments can adapt to,\" Miller says. And that means the shift would potentially leave millions without a major thread in the safety net they've come to rely on, flawed as it is.\n"

      "There is an unpaved road near the edge of a woods outside the tiny Appalachian town of Frostburg, Maryland. That is where two white box trucks, the kind one might rent to move houses, were parked on Sunday, Feb. 16, when a fleet of officers from the Maryland State Police, the Allegany County Sheriff's Office, and the Department of Natural Resources Police descended. In the cab of one of the trucks, Maryland State Trooper Brandon Jeffries would later recall in court records obtained by Rolling Stone, he found a young man dressed all in black. The windows of the second truck were fogged over, but when Jeffries unlatched the back door, he discovered two other individuals, similarly clad in black and wearing holsters stocked with ammunition. Outside the truck, the trooper told the trio they were trespassing. They said they understood, and promised to leave. But first, they would have to give their names. They refused. A search of the truck subsequently turned up two firearms, a long rifle and handgun. Officers would discover a third -- a fully loaded Sig Sauer P365 pistol -- tucked in the waistband of one of the three as she resisted being handcuffed. An FBI agent would later confirm their identities: Daniel Blank, 26, Michelle Zajko, 33, and 34-year-old Jack Amadeus LaSota, who uses feminine pronouns. Online and in certain Bay Area circles LaSota is known as \" Ziz ,\" a charismatic figure who gained a following blogging about her pseudoscientific theories about brain function, her pop culture-inflected ideas about morality, and her efforts to live by the principles espoused by certain thinkers in the Bay Area's eclectic \"rationalist\" scene. The three had been detained together before, two years earlier and more than 200 miles away, at a motel in Chester, Pennsylvania, in January 2023. Pennsylvania State Police were executing a warrant, seeking DNA and a gun belonging to Zajko, as part of their investigation into the murder of her parents, two weeks earlier on New Year's Eve. In the process of detaining Zajko and her then-roommate, Blank, police discovered LaSota -- previously missing and, at one time, presumed dead -- on the floor of the Candlewood Suites bathroom. Her eyes were closed, and she was nonresponsive, but apparently alive. None of the three have been charged in connection to the Pennsylvania double homicide. Blank and Zajko -- both of whom remain \"persons of interest\" in the murders today, according to records -- were quickly released in 2023. LaSota was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing or hindering police, and held for several months before she was released. Within the year, all three would disappear: Blank was reported missing in April, and in December of that year, LaSota failed to appear at a hearing for her trial in Pennsylvania. Locating the three of them became a more urgent matter for law enforcement as questions arose regarding possible connections to other, more recent murders: the violent stabbing of an octogenarian landlord in Vallejo, California, on Jan. 17, and a traffic stop turned firefight that claimed the lives of a border patrol agent and a 28-year-old quant trader in Coventry, Vermont, three days later. \"All of the subjects involved are to be questioned regarding other crimes that have occurred across the country,\" the Maryland incident report stated. (The Allegany County public defender representing LaSota, Zajko, and Blank did not respond to requests for comment from Rolling Stone. ) After their arrest in Maryland last week, all three were charged with trespassing and obstructing and hindering police activity, both misdemeanors. LaSota and Zajko were each additionally charged with misdemeanor firearm offenses, and Zajko was charged with resisting arrest. All three are currently being held without bond in Maryland, but prosecutors alleged in court last Tuesday they are part of an \"extremist group.\" For some individuals who became acquainted with Ziz during the time she spent living in and around the Bay Area, news of her detention came as a relief. For years, members of the rationalist community had warned that she was dangerous. As one pseudonymous poster wrote in a lengthy post in 2020, \"Ziz is a master manipulator; she is extremely skilled at selling people on nonsense ideas about decision theory and ethics that defy not just the 'rules of rationality,' but basic common sense.\" That writer coined the term \"Zizians,\" but it's not clear that Ziz or any of the other half-dozen individuals currently detained in connection with the string of violent incidents that have unfolded across the country would describe themselves that way. Many are fiercely committed vegans; a number are trans or otherwise gender fluid; almost all of them have been recognized for their academic or intellectual achievement; and at least two were reported missing by their families. All are deeply invested in ideas advanced by the \"rationalist\" movement. The \"rationalist\" community -- both the online version and the IRL one, largely concentrated in Berkeley, California -- grew out of a pair of mid-aughts blogs, \"Overcoming Bias\" and \"LessWrong,\" which were concerned with improving one's decision-making abilities. Optimizing. \" Winning .\" An early rallying cry, made by LessWrong's founder and most prolific poster, Eliezer Yudkowsky, discussed the idea of \"raising the sanity waterline\" -- something members of the community believed would naturally happen if everyone applied rationalist principles in their own lives. The concept of \"effective altruism,\" promoted by the billion-dollar crypto ponzi artist Sam Bankman-Fried, came out of the rationalist world. These ideas also attracted a large number of individuals who were concerned with the existential threat posed by artificial intelligence, and were determined to systematically identify and address those risks in hope of staving off disaster. (The romance between Elon Musk and the singer Grimes blossomed over a play on words referencing a LessWrong post about the threat of sentient AI.) Today, someone who self-identifies as a \"rationalist\" might belong to any of three offshoots concerned with self-improvement, effective altruism, or AI risk. Ziz, one person who knew her told me, was right at the intersection of all three. Before she adopted female pronouns and the name \"Ziz,\" LaSota was born in Alaska and studied computer science at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, eventually moving to the Bay Area in 2015 to be closer to the rationalist community, with designs on pursuing a career in the tech industry. Like Bankman-Fried, LaSota, as she would later explain on her blog, pursued a tech career with the goal of \"earning-to-give,\" or securing a high-paying job, then donating the bulk of her salary toward the greater good. LaSota initially planned on giving to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, an organization founded by LessWrong's Yudkowsky, devoted to managing existential risks posed by artificial intelligence. (Other major donors to the small nonprofit include PayPal founder Peter Thiel 's foundation and Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum.) But LaSota's tech career was short-lived. She chafed against the expectations that she would put in long hours at two different startups that hired her soon after she arrived in the Bay Area. At the first company, she wrote on her blog, \"I walked out of the office after 8 hours of work. (They seemed upset, \"where are you going?\", half an hour later calling me to say I was fired.)\" At the second, she wrote, they \"kept demanding that I work unpaid overtime, talking about how other employees just always put 40 hours on their timesheet no matter what... When I refused to work longer than 40 hours a week, they did not renew my 3 month contract.\" \"I don't think Jack LaSota made much of an impression,\" one person who first met LaSota at the offices of MIRI and its sister organization, the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), tells me. But that would soon change. Running out of money and anxious over the cost of housing in the notoriously expensive Bay Area, LaSota and an acquaintance from the scene, Gwen Danielson, another trans woman, came up with an idea of creating a flotilla that would function as rent-free housing for members of the rationalist community. They called it the \"Rat Fleet.\" \"LaSota was just some nerdy kid,\" the person who knew her from MIRI recalls. But when the two met again, months later, everything seemed to have changed. \"Ziz was someone who was dressing in these dark, ominous robes, and living on a tugboat in the harbor with other very weird people.\" In July 2017, before she was Ziz, LaSota sent an email to the CFAR alumni listserv, seeking crew members to join her and Danielson on a voyage. The two of them and a third individual, Daniel Powell, had purchased a decommissioned Navy tugboat, the Caleb , located in Ketchikan, Alaska. They planned to sail it to Half Moon Bay, California, where they would anchor it outside the harbor to avoid paying for a slip. \"Crew with experience navigating the Inside Passage, operating a large vessel (>100 gross tons), or other relevant experience may be paid wages based on experience,\" LaSota wrote. \"Contact me if interested. Also, suggest names for a tugboat if you think you have a better name than Caleb.\" Actualizing their vision of the Rat Fleet ended up being considerably more difficult than they anticipated: According to a government lawsuit later filed against Danielson and another of the Caleb' s owners, officials with the U.S. Coast Guard and San Mateo Harbor District issued repeated warnings to the tugboat over environmental concerns -- the boat had 3,000 gallons of diesel and other petroleum products on board that they worried might leak into the bay -- and concerns for the safety of other boats in the harbor. On multiple occasions, the lawsuit alleges, the Caleb dragged its anchor, drifting in the direction of other vessels. Eventually, the San Francisco Chronicle reported , Curtis Lind, who was also living on a boat in the harbor at the time, offered to sell them a new anchor. A person who visited the Caleb during this time tells me that LaSota and Danielson mentioned being hassled by authorities who seemed to think they were sovereign citizens, a largely right-wing movement whose adherents reject the idea that the government has any authority over them. \"I didn't quite get it at the time. I understand a lot better now: the thing that they were doing was sort of like a much, much, much, much smarter version of the sovereign citizen thing,\" this person says. Pursuing a life without a permanent address was one example of their efforts to live outside of society's strictures, but there are others: faking their deaths in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution (as both Danielson and LaSota allegedly would); using alleged medical emergencies in an effort to escape from police custody (as LaSota is said to have done on at least two occasions -- once successfully, and a second time unsuccessfully); and offering fake names to police (as prosecutors allege LaSota and one compatriot have done). The boat, which LaSota eventually sold her share in for $1, and which Danielson ultimately abandoned, sank in the outer anchorage of Pillar Point Harbor in March 2022. It remains there to this day, partially submerged and posing \"a danger to navigation, health, safety, and the environment,\" according to lawyers for the San Mateo Harbor District, who have sued Danielson and Powell for the costs associated with removing the tugboat. In 2023, the court issued a default judgment declaring the abandoned boat \"marine debris\" and granting the Harbor District permission to remove it. As the Rat Fleet was floundering, LaSota and her comrades were simultaneously growing disillusioned with two of the institutional centers of the rationalist community: MIRI and CFAR. On Nov. 15, 2019, LaSota, Danielson, and two other individuals -- Emma Borhanian and Alex Leatham, who went by \"Somni\" -- staged a protest outside of a Northern California retreat center where CFAR was holding an alumni reunion. According to the police report, LaSota, Danielson, Borhanian, and Leatham arrived at the retreat center wearing black hooded robes, black gloves, and Guy Fawkes masks, and proceeded to block the property's entrances and exits with their vehicles. One eyewitness recalls that the protesters refused to engage with staff or police, but they were determinedly foisting flyers that read \"MIRICFAR betrayed us\" on passersby. Among other accusations, the flyers asserted that MIRI \"paid out to blackmail using donor funds\" -- a reference to a protracted dispute with an ex-employee, and an allegation that MIRI denies. The protesters were less concerned with the substance of the allegations made by that ex-employee, several people familiar explain, than they were with the fact that MIRI -- which staked its credibility on promoting sound decision-making -- would back down. In their view, this not only represented bad \"decision theory,\" but called the organization's entire existence into question. Ziz's understanding of \"decision theory\" is drawn from Newcomb's Paradox, a thought experiment popular with the LessWrong crowd, that originated with a theoretical physicist at Berkeley's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the 1960s. It concerns a pair of boxes -- a clear one with $1,000 in it, and an opaque one that either holds $1 million or nothing -- whose contents are determined by an all-knowing, nearly infallible \"predictor.\" If the predictor believes you'll choose either box, box B will be empty. If it predicts you will choose only B, B will contain $1 million. The catch is that the predictor bases its guess on its knowledge of you: If you are the type of person who would only choose the second box, that information factors into its prediction. By the protesters' logic, MIRI would never have been \"blackmailed\" if it wasn't the type of organization that could be \"blackmailed\" in the first place. The protesters' appearance -- the robes, gloves, masks -- and the fact that they wouldn't respond to questions or commands, spooked staff at the retreat center, who called the police. The entire retreat center -- which happened to be hosting a group of elementary-school-age students for a team-building exercise that day -- was put on lockdown as helicopters, a SWAT team, and bomb squad swarmed the property. LaSota, Danielson, Borhanian, and Leatham were arrested and initially charged with criminal conspiracy, trespassing, wearing a mask for an unlawful purpose, false imprisonment, resisting arrest, and child endangerment. (\"The actions of the suspects created an emotional and mental suffering to several of the children who were visibly upset and distraught as a result of this incident,\" the police report said.) The subsequent criminal case -- and a countersuit, alleging mistreatment at the hands of law enforcement during their detention -- would drag on for years. Dan Kapelovitz, the lawyer who represented LaSota in her criminal case, was still fighting for video footage of her arrest, typically easy to obtain in situations like this one, when he was informed -- erroneously, it would later turn out -- that his client had died. According to documents filed in San Mateo District Court, on the afternoon of Aug. 19, 2022, Ziz had taken Borhanian and Naomi LaSota, Ziz's sister, out \"for an afternoon on the water\" aboard the Black Cygnet, a small sailboat LaSota purchased before the Caleb. But things took a turn around 11 p.m., as the three headed back toward the marina. \"LaSota was working with the motor on the back of the boat and fell into the water out in the bay,\" Borhanian wrote in a declaration attached to a petition intended to officially establish LaSota's death. \"I lost sight of Jack while looking for a life preserver.\" The pair called the Coast Guard, which mounted an exhaustive search effort -- involving a helicopter, a drone and several boats, lasting 28.5 hours covering an area of 167 nautical miles -- before it was called off, unsuccessful. LaSota's family hired a probate lawyer to settle their child's estate, and placed an obituary in their hometown newspaper, remembering LaSota's love for \"adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals.\" Believing his client to be dead, Kapelovitz formally requested to be let off the case, which he still believes would have eventually been dropped. (\"The government had an extremely weak case,\" he tells me.) But a few months later, Kapelovitz received a letter from the district attorney in Solano County, informing him that LaSota was alive, and had been in contact with police at a Vallejo property owned by Curtis Lind -- the acquaintance from Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay who'd offered them a new anchor -- after Lind was viciously attacked by several people. In early 2020, as life on the tugboat was wearing on them, Lind reportedly offered Danielson and LaSota the opportunity to move to a piece of property he owned: a dusty parking lot at the end of a cul-de-sac in South Vallejo. The two of them and others, who would soon grow to number more than a dozen, began living in box trucks parked on the premises -- a sort of landlocked version of the Rat Fleet. Among the residents at the property were two of the CFAR protesters -- Leatham, who was employed by UC Berkeley at one point, and Borhanian, a former Google engineer -- and a third person who reportedly used the name Silver-and-Ivory. Then the pandemic hit, and tenants at the property stopped paying rent. Lind eventually sought an eviction order against Danielson, LaSota (identified as \"Ziz Doe\" in court records), Borhanian, as well as 18 other named residents and \"all unknown occupants.\" The court declared those tenants owed Lind more than $60,000 back rent, damages, and other costs. Lind was granted that judgment on Oct. 27, 2022. Two and half weeks later, two days before the sheriff was reportedly set to evict them, Lind was attacked. Patrick McMillian, who was living on the property, would later tell a local news station that Lind banged on his RV door, covered in blood, at 7:30 in the morning. \"He said 'I'm dying.' I saw him with a sword sticking through his back and it came out his chest.\" Lind had fired on his attackers, killing one -- Borhanian -- and injuring Leatham. Leatham and the individual who went by Silver-and-Ivory at the property, but who gave police the name \"Suri Dao,\" were arrested. (While questions remain, prosecutors have since alleged that Dao is actually Tessa Berns, a 24-year-old former National Merit Scholar who once medaled in the Colorado state spelling bee.) Leatham and Dao were charged with aggravated mayhem, Lind's attempted murder, as well as Borhanian's murder, under a California law that allows for a person to be charged if they provoke another person to commit a killing. Dao has pleaded not guilty. Dao's lawyer did not respond to an inquiry from Rolling Stone. It's not clear from available records if Leatham has entered a plea; the Solano County Alternate Public Defender, representing Leatham, did not respond to an inquiry about the case. As the district attorney in Vallejo would later inform LaSota's lawyer, LaSota was also apparently at the scene of the attack on Lind. Wired has reported that LaSota was taken to the police station for questioning that day, where she gave the name \"Julia Dawson.\" \"Dawson\" experienced an apparent medical episode, and was taken to a nearby hospital, before she disappeared. Lind miraculously survived. The only eyewitness to his own assault, he was preparing to testify at a trial set to begin later this year, when he was attacked again on Jan. 17, 2025 -- this time fatally. The person arrested and charged with Lind's murder is Maximillian Snyder, another National Merit Scholar and a graduate of Seattle's prestigious Lakeside School, who also attended Oxford University and who was a poster on LessWrong. Snyder has not entered a plea in the case, but he did dictate a lengthy letter from jail, imploring Eliezer Yudkowsky -- the founder of LessWrong and MIRI -- to convert to veganism. In that letter, Snyder also sought to distance himself from Ziz, writing, \"I am not one of Ziz's friends. Neither she nor her friends endorse me or my words, so far as I know. I speak only for myself, as myself, for the sake of everyone.\" (Snyder's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.) According to a federal complaint, three days after Lind's murder, a 21-year-old woman named Teresa Youngblut abruptly opened fire on a border-patrol agent named David Maland, after Maland pulled over the Prius she was driving for an immigration check in Coventry, Vermont. A German-born quant trader and a trans woman known to the rationalist community as Ophelia Bauckholt, who was in the car with Youngblut, also drew a gun. Both Maland and Bauckholt were killed in the ensuing firefight, and Youngblut was injured. Youngblut has pleaded not guilty to two federal charges, including assault of a border-patrol officer with a deadly weapon. (She is being represented by a federal public defender, who did not respond to a request for comment.) Two months before the shooting and stabbing incidents that took place more than 3,000 miles apart, the nonprofit newsroom OpenVallejo reported, Youngblut, who also attended Seattle's Lakeside School, had applied for a marriage license with Maximillian Snyder in Washington state. Last Tuesday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms alleged another connection: the guns drawn by Youngblut and Bauckholt in the border patrol shootout Michelle Zajko, as well as the SigSauer found on Zajko at the time of her arrest in Maryland on Feb. 16, were all purchased by Zajko at the same Vermont gun shop a year earlier. (Zajko is accused by the ATF of using an address where she was no longer living on her application forms.) The same day, last Tuesday, there was a hearing in Maryland on the newest set of charges against Zajko, Blank and LaSota; in court, prosecutors shared that one of the two box trucks the trio were living in at the time of their arrest was registered to Youngblut. At that hearing in Maryland last Tuesday, LaSota addressed the judge directly, insisting on her innocence. \"I haven't done anything wrong. I shouldn't be here,\" she reportedly said . \"I wish I could be more eloquent. Maybe I could if the circumstances were better.\" The judge appeared unmoved. All three are currently being held without bail.\n"

      "Final text\n",
      "President Donald J. Trump was sworn into office just one month ago, but for many Americans, these few weeks have felt like years. Executive orders targeting diversity programs and marginalized groups, purges of the federal government , high-level resignations, extremist cabinet nominees , Elon Musk 's forcible takeover of the administrative state, mass deportations, bizarre threats to annex Greenland and Canada , the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico , a string of deadly airline disasters, clashes between the White House and the judiciary, feuds with the press, and rising tensions over Russia 's war in Ukraine -- it's hard to keep up with Trump's daily blitz of authoritarian action and propaganda, let alone get a sense of the bigger picture. One word comes up again and again as the media, legal experts, and longtime government officials try to describe what Trump has done in retaking power and launching a campaign of revenge against his enemies: \"unprecedented.\" It seems there is little to which his ferocious rule and brazen corruption can be compared, at least in the past two and a half centuries of the American republic. But the United States is still a young country, and a longer, more global view yields fascinating parallels to our moment that date back to antiquity. Here, seven historians tell Rolling Stone how monarchs, elites, and dictators of the past anticipated someone like Trump, the results of their often brash and short-sighted decisions, and what kind of legacies they ultimately left behind. The stories aren't road maps to the future, exactly. As most of these academics pointed out, history doesn't really repeat itself. But, as they say, it can rhyme -- and those echoes can help us make sense out of chaos. Roel Konijnendijk, a classics professor and Darby Fellow in ancient history at the University of Oxford, warns that we should be careful in trying to draw connections between the Trump era and previous incarnations of brute power. \"The regime's particular combination of far-right bigotry and illegal asset stripping seems to me a unique product of the country's character and history,\" he says of the current White House. \"There are plenty of cruel strongmen in ancient history with a total disregard for the responsibilities of office, but they never had the ideological context to imagine some of the things we're seeing now.\" Still, he points to ancient Greece, and the commentary of Thucydides, the Athenian historian who lived in the 5th century BC. In his writings on the Peloponnesian War between Sparta and Athens for dominance in the Hellenic world, Thucydides remarked on the causes of an uprising in the city of Corcyra, where proponents of democracy overthrew a wealthy ruling class and put many of them to death. The civil strife in Corcyra, Thucydides notes, was the sort that \"happened then and will forever continue to happen as long as human nature remains the same.\" As Konijnendijk puts it, Thucydides \"goes through a long list of familiar items: partisan rhetoric, distortion of truth, corruption of judgment, suspicion and paranoia, glorification of violence, faithless backstabbing, cruel vengeance, and polarization of society to the point where the moderate citizens are 'destroyed' and appeals to decency are 'laughed out of sight.'\" In the end, Konijnendijk says, \"the democratic party annihilated the oligarchs in a seven-day orgy of violence.\" While it's true that material conditions were vastly different in Greece almost 2,500 years ago, here in a post-Capitol riot U.S., popular armed revolt against the super-rich doesn't sound quite as far-fetched as it did a few decades ago. Yii-Jan Lin, a professor at Yale Divinity School who has written about how the apocalyptic narrative of the Bible's Book of Revelation influenced American ideas about immigration , says one common historical comparison these days is off the mark: \"When Caligula appoints a horse as a consul,\" she says with a laugh, adding that this tale of the 1st century Roman emperor's purported insanity is \"just apocryphal.\" Instead, Lin finds a possible precursor to Trump in Julian the Apostate, emperor of Rome from 361 to 363 CE. Playing to a nostalgia for the earlier Pax Romana under Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, Julian rejected the rise of Christianity (Constantine I, the first emperor to convert to the religion, had ruled a few decades earlier, granting Christians certain freedom of worship and setting Rome on the path toward adopting it as a state religion by the end of the century). Julian \"rescinded all the privileges that were given to Christians,\" says Lin. \"He wanted to basically purge the kingdom of that and install traditional paganism.\" This attempt to turn back the clock included the purging of Christian texts from schools, the conversion of Christian churches into pagan temples, and religious persecution as it had been practiced in centuries past. \"There's also his movement [for] increasing efficiency of government, which is going to sound really familiar,\" Lin adds, alluding to Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), which Trump has empowered to gut U.S. federal agencies . Julian had \"thousands of different servants\" dismissed, Lin says, and \"also had some tribunals set up in which we had he had high-ranking officials executed.\" But Trump's reign is unlikely to end the way Julian's did. The emperor \"launched a counter-invasion of Persia in 363, and he was wounded and died while retreating,\" Lin says, bringing two years of upheaval to an end. His successors were, of course, all Christian. Lin sees Julian's failure as a potential lesson for would-be tyrants: \"This kind of aggressive, chaotic power also will inflict damage on itself.\" Jeremy Swist is a classics professor at Grand Valley State University specializing in late antiquity, when the Roman Empire effectively split into two, with the western half collapsing in the 5th century CE as the eastern half -- what we often call the Byzantine Empire -- survived and evolved. He maintains that while it is impossible to extrapolate from this period to predict where the 21st century is leading, we can \"put ourselves in the shoes of everyday people living under similar conditions, and imagine how they might have felt as forces beyond their control attempted to radically change their society, further exacerbating already existing social divisions, and aggravated by environmental and public health crises.\" To that end, he takes up the example of Justinian I, emperor of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire from 527 to 565 CE. Justinian, Swist says, assumed power in a time marked by fierce tribalism in religious and social life, and early in his reign brutally suppressed an insurrection against him in the capital city of Constantinople, killing citizens without regard for the their sovereignty, which was still guaranteed by the law despite centuries of autocratic rule. In an inversion of Julian the Apostate's anti-Christian policies, Justinian was \"determined to stamp out paganism,\" says Swist, and impose his interpretation of Christian theology throughout the empire. \"This outlawing of religious pluralism manifested in attacks on what we would call institutions of higher education, as the most publicly visible pagans at that time were highly educated professors of philosophy, rhetoric, law, and medicine,\" he explains. \"These intellectuals were deemed threats to Christian morality, and famous schools such as the Platonic Academy in Athens were shut down and its faculty forced to flee the empire. The emperor aimed his moral crusade also at what he termed sexual deviancy, inflicting cruel punishments on those charged with homosexual activities, while he likewise cracked down on sex workers.\" Justinian's attempts to homogenize society and enact order with new and systematized laws were paired with outsized ambition and vanity. \"Justinian frequently named and renamed things after himself, such as several cities as 'Justinianopolis,'\" Swist says. His large building projects and expensive wars abroad, including campaigns to reconquer territories of the Western Roman Empire, drained the imperial treasury and eventually left the empire vulnerable to invasion. The waning of its power was hastened by climate change, namely \"a drop in temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere by over four degrees Fahrenheit that persisted for a number of years that negatively affected agriculture,\" Swist says, and a pandemic in the form of \"an early form of bubonic plague\" that killed hundreds of thousands. Swist explains that we may well empathize with the people who tried to live through all this as we confront the uncertainties of a turbulent political atmosphere today. In one regard, we may be worse off, as Justinian's empire lacked the technological means \"to monitor its own citizens,\" he notes. Yet it's also too soon to tell what effects Trump's own harsh edicts may have. \"So far we are mostly seeing the laying out of an agenda, and we may be experiencing a lot of shock and awe, but time will tell how much of it will stick and have long-term consequences,\" says Swist. Eleanor Janega, a medieval historian and co-host of the podcast Gone Medieval who writes extensively on how contemporary society is imprinted by that epoch, looks at the risks Trump poses to the international economy and geopolitical stability and is reminded of King John of England, an unpopular ruler who occupied the throne from 1199 to his death in 1216. Janega says it is a \"massive misunderstanding\" to believe that \"everything was great\" after the rebel barons forced John to seal the Magna Carta, the famous charter of legal protections first issued in 1215. Instead, she points out, these rich landowners were shielding themselves and their assets, not the rights of commoners. \"John was indeed a very bad king, and the nobles were in revolt against him because he blew all of the kingdom's money on war in France, and Magna Carta was drawn up in response to this,\" Janega says. But, she continues, \"John decided he was just going to ignore that fact. Moreover, he asked for, and received, direct papal support in this. Pope Innocent III wrote from Rome to support John and stated that Magna Carta was 'not only shameful and demeaning, but illegal and unjust,' and he excommunicated the barons,\" who then waged a civil war against John. Magna Carta would not be reissued until 1225, under John's son, Henry III. Now as back then, Janega says, the rest of the world is capitulating to what a nation is doing -- this time the U.S. -- in order to preserve their own relative status. Nobody, she says, \"wants to say anything to America because they don't want to establish a precedent wherein the power of any government can be questioned.\" King John's excessive spending threatened the comfortable status quo of the barons, so they fought for Magna Carta; today's billionaires have sought to guide Trump's agenda so they can keep raking in profit even in the case of a devastating blow to markets, with these same oligarchs -- Musk in particular -- posing as champions for individual liberties. \"If Trump was just trashing the civil rights of Americans, that would be one thing, but threatening the world economy is another,\" says Janega. \"So, we are seeing people do the internal math about who they will align with in order to protect their own interests as wealthy individuals.\" \"There are always going to be wealthy and powerful people who side with destructive forces to suit their own ends,\" she adds. \"There are also always going to be powerful people who overlook the rule of law because it gets in the way of them doing what they want. This is in no way unprecedented. This is what happens when the wealthy and powerful aren't strictly controlled. They will always seek to do these things, and that's why taxation and limitations of power are important.\" Besides Julian the Apostate, Yii-Jan Lin mentions the Spanish monarchs King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1492, the same year the royals sent Christopher Columbus on his first expedition to the so-called \"New World,\" they issued the Alhambra Decree, exiling the Jewish population from their territory. \"Here we have mass deportation,\" says Lin. \"And that was just an incredibly boneheaded move. Not only incredibly racist and terrible, but also, you think of all the different parts of the economy and society that Jewish peoples were a part of in Spain, and the [king and queen] are cutting their nose off to spite their face.\" Even as riches began flowing back from the Americas, Spain's economy was effectively collapsing because of the attempt to uproot Jews -- \"getting rid of an integral part of your workforce, your culture and society, without thinking about the consequences at all,\" as Lin puts it. The displacement also meant that important arts, heritage, and wealth moved to other parts of Europe. Lin says there's no shortage of examples of disastrous deportations like those Trump wants to see. \"I mean, before Trump, there's plenty of it in American history, rounding up people,\" she says. \"It just brings in a different population. With Chinese exclusion laws [in the late 19th century U.S.], then you have Japanese agricultural workers. Then you have Asian exclusion [in the 1920s], so you bring in Mexican migrant workers. So it just continues and continues, and you can shift the hate onto who you want. But the real story is that you need workers.\" You don't have to look very far to find instances of people likening Trump to Adolf Hitler. His own vice president , J.D. Vance , did it back in 2016, and his new Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy , did the same that year. The analogy is typically dismissed by MAGA voters as a hysterical exaggeration, while its usefulness in liberal or leftist critiques of Trump seems minimal. Yet it's impossible to overlook some of the similarities between the Trump administration's actions and those of the Nazis as they consolidated power in Germany in the 1930s. Ben Miller, a doctoral fellow at the Graduate School of Global Intellectual History at the Freie Universitat in Berlin and co-host of the podcast Bad Gays , which looks at \"evil and complicated queers in history,\" observes that both quickly took steps to erase and demonize transgender people. \"This is the most concerted, immediate anti-trans push by a newly elected government or by a newly installed government since the ascension of the Nazis to power in Germany,\" he says. \"And that's not to say that the Trump administration is literally the new Nazis, but it is to say that both the Trump administration and the National Socialist dictatorship have immediate interest in targeting trans people.\" In both cases, Miller says, the regimes reacted to noticeable changes in the \" sex/gender system ,\" a concept coined by sociologist Gayle Rubin, meaning the social structures that transform biological sexuality into our ways of existing in the world. (A far greater share of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ + compared to older generations, for instance.) Importantly, though, Miller clarifies, the attacks on trans people are \"the front of a flying wedge which is really going after the bodily autonomy of absolutely everybody, cis women included. That doesn't mean that what's happening to trans people isn't, on its own, important, or a distraction from the real fight. That is the real fight right now. Those are real people. These are real lives that are being hurt, and we need to fight for them and with them. But it is to say that all of us have a stake in that fight, because all of us have an interest in having control over the capacities of our bodies and over the decisions that we make about our bodies.\" The restriction of reproductive rights is one obvious area of overlap when it comes to the policing of gender identity and sexuality, Miller says. The Nazis developed \"a very detailed and very elaborate pseudoscience of race\" that \"justified the idea of turning the right kind of women into birthing machines for the right kinds of people,\" he notes. \"The philosophy behind what the Trump administration is doing is more diffuse and less specific, but I think there are some definite echoes when J.D. Vance says we need more babies, meaning we need more of the right kind of babies -- as opposed to immigrants.\" Miller acknowledges, too, groups like Gays for Trump, with members seeking to distinguish separate from other LGBTQ individuals, and the existence of men in 1920s and 1930s Germany \"who thought of themselves as being normal gay guys\" and \"very much thought that they had nothing to fear for Nazism.\" One gay member of the original Nazi paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA), in fact, wrote an anonymous memoir drawing a link between his sexuality and, as Miller describes it, the \"homoerotic band of brotherhood of the fascist militia.\" \"Now, of course, that didn't go very well,\" Miller continues. \"When the Nazis came to power, they did a lot of things that the Trump administration is not doing right now. They sent police in to shut down gay bars immediately and started initiating mass arrests for sodomy under an existing anti-sodomy statute.\" The outcomes for stigmatized people who cast their lot with an autocratic force out of \"misguided conviction, or out of fear, or out of the misguided idea that that they can somehow make themselves safe by punching others in the face, historically is very bad,\" he says. \"The track record for solidarity is much better.\" Alex von Tunzelmann is a historian who focuses on 20th century international relations and political iconography; her most recent book, Fallen Idols , is about the toppling of controversial historical monuments. She says that while Trump may not yet meet the definition of a dictator, his style recalls \"those of many 20th and 21st century absolute rulers,\" from \"declaring himself above the law\" to \"attempting to govern through relentless executive orders.\" \"It's not unusual for absolutists to lean on informal yet highly visible lieutenants, in this case Elon Musk,\" von Tunzelmann says. \"That's a powerful but precarious position to hold: such lieutenants either tend to become extremely unpopular, drawing fire sometimes literally away from the authoritarian himself; or they become too popular, threatening the authoritarian. Adolf Hitler's 'man with the iron heart,' Reinhard Heydrich, was assassinated. Vladimir Putin's Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin briefly led a rebellion against him and soon afterwards was killed in a suspicious plane crash.\" Trump's \"erratic\" behavior, she adds, \"destabilizes everyone around him and establishes him as the only fixed point,\" his version of a \"mad king\" act that -- deliberately or not -- frames his power as \"unpredictable and unboundaried.\" (An extreme case would be Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin, known to play up stories about his alleged cannibalism.) Von Tunzelmann also cites the attempted renamings of geographical features such as the Gulf of Mexico as a dictator-like move. \"Among many renamings, Rafael Trujillo renamed the capital of the Dominican Republic Ciudad Trujillo, and the country's highest mountain Pico Trujillo,\" she says. \"I was strongly reminded of this when I learned there was a bill in the West Virginia House of Delegates to rename the state's highest point, Spruce Knob, 'Trump Mountain'\" You know an authoritarian has really arrived when he doesn't even have to order this stuff any more: people just do it to suck up to him.\" Von Tunzelmann is meanwhile struck by Musk's foregrounding of his young son X AE A-Xii (X for short), and a few of his other children , as a new wrinkle in MAGA iconography. Joseph Stalin was one for such displays as well. \"At the same time he was imprisoning, torturing, and murdering millions of people, Stalin loved to be depicted surrounded by smiling children: for instance, statues of Stalin and the Happy Soviet Child were mass-produced and put up in schools, hospitals, and parks across the Soviet Union,\" she says. \"That contrast between the benign, fatherly image and horrific reality was intentional. Of course, Stalin had mostly terrible and sometimes nonexistent relationships with his own children, who he had by lots of different women.\" Musk consistently (but inaccurately ) claims that humans are facing population collapse and should be having more babies, and often carries his son X on his shoulders during public appearances, to the frustration of X's mother, the musician Grimes . Although he has at least 12 children by three women, Musk has been criticized as an absent father by his estranged trans daughter, and has pointedly ignored communications about family needs from Grimes and a right-wing influencer who recently claimed to have given birth to another son of his, according to the two mothers. Lastly, Latin America may shed light on what Trump and his allies are doing now that they control the government. Luis Herran Avila is a historian of the Cold War in the region, with a particular interest in anti-communist and extreme right-wing movements, and a professor at the University of New Mexico. He says that the hostile Republican approach to the U.S. educational system has the hallmarks of past crackdowns on schools and scholarship in the Southern Hemisphere. \"The military regimes in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, to name the classic examples, were very much invested in the idea that education had been taken over by Marxists at all levels, but most especially in universities,\" Herran Avila says. \"In Chile, the military plainly defunded public universities, causing a drastic drop in enrollments and closing avenues for upward social mobility. Ideologically speaking, their outlook was not drastically different from that of the U.S. right (then and now): they saw campuses as sites of indoctrination and perversion; they despised youth counterculture, feared women's sexual liberation and feminism, and practically equated things like birth control or sex before marriage as attemtps to destroy the moral foundations of the nation.\" These notions, Herran Avila observes, \"may not be very original,\" but they retain a certain \"potency.\" In late 2023, Javier Milei, an economist turned pundit and then politician, took office as president of Argentina, and inflicted harsh austerity measures while firing thousands of government workers. Musk has praised these policies and apparently found inspiration in Milei's \" chainsaw \" attacks when organizing DOGE to do the same for Washington on Trump's behalf. \"The key to understand this historical connection,\" Herran Avila says, \"is the use of concentrated authoritarian power (acquired via coups back then; and through elections now) to 'demolish' the public sector in the name of a crusade against corruption, impose deregulation in the name of efficiency, and promote the power of corporate elites in the name of innovation.\" The \"promise of some kind of 'rebirth' or 'redemption' from the mistakes and sins of predecessors,\" he adds, is \"an important component linking the present to what those military regimes were pursuing 50-plus years ago.\" An antecedent to this rhetoric, Herran Avila says, can be found in the Argentine military's seizure of power in 1976, as the subsequent regime claimed to be conducting a \"process of national reorganization,\" (a.k.a. El Proceso), \"almost akin to a 'revolution' or a radical reconfiguration of state and society, but for and by the right.\" The junta carried out a bloody campaign of state terrorism in which it killed or disappeared tens of thousands of perceived dissidents to quell any political opposition. As with some of the other atrocities addressed here, this nightmare has thankfully not come to pass for the United States. But from top to bottom, the correlations that leap to mind for historians when they consider Trump's stated priorities in a second term are hardly encouraging. While this whirlwind of a first month promises more reckless and vicious politics to come, and no one can hope to predict truly \"unprecedented\" turns in the national narrative, the truth is that in certain and meaningful ways, people have been here before.\n"

      "Mark Hays is the Associate Director, Cryptocurrency and Financial Technology at Demand Progress Education Fund and Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund. Days before taking the oath of office, Donald Trump and his family launched a new cryptocurrency token -- known informally as a meme coin -- called $TRUMP, as the crypto industry held an inaugural ball. Despite scant details about the coin's value, use, or risks, trading took off, sending the coin's price skyrocketing. On paper at least (or on the blockchain, as it were), the Trump family and their businesses are now several billion dollars richer. Not to be outdone, first lady Melania Trump has also launched her own meme coin . Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, is distancing herself from an unauthorized $Ivanka coin . While campaigning, Trump promised to make the United States the \" crypto capital of the planet \" after crypto bros poured over $130 million to elect a crypto-captive administration and Congress. Trump has tapped pro-crypto acolytes for regulatory posts across the federal government and released pro-crypto executive orders to establish a White House crypto working group and prioritize crypto across government. To top it off, the huckster-in-chief launched his $TRUMP meme coin: one part a vehicle for personal profit, one part a playground taunt over federal ethics rules, and one part a crypto-fascist pledge of allegiance. It's a move that could not only rip off Trump supporters but also significantly corrode the democratic process. Let's step back. In case you're wondering, a \"meme coin\" is a crypto token based on little more than an online image, slogan, or passing social trend. The crypto industry argues it is a sort of digital collectible. The fine print on the $TRUMP coin website notes that the coins \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.\" Famous meme coins include Dogecoin (a crypto token based on the image of a dog, originally introduced as a parody of crypto) and various tokens based on the controversial, alt-right mascot Pepe the Frog. Another recent example is $HAWK, fronted by Haliey Welch , known as the \" Hawk Tuah \" girl (for her colorful description of an intimate act during an on-the-street interview). A meme coin doesn't even purport to do anything (as opposed to other crypto assets, which still have almost no practical uses other than laundering drug money or tax evasion ). Most end up being worthless; many are outright \"rug pulls\" that lure in retail investors with hype, pumping up the value, only so insiders can cash out and leave others holding the bag -- as may have been the case with $HAWK, which plummeted 90 percent after its launch . The $TRUMP fine print requires meme coin buyers to give up their rights to sue, the remedy many $HAWK coinholders are now pursuing. Instead, they would have to go through forced arbitration. The crypto industry is awash in fraud, but even by its own standards, meme coins are unabashedly scammy. Self-proclaimed serious crypto proponents -- including those who blame or mischaracterize the Biden administration's efforts to regulate crypto and protect investors as the real problem -- have sought to publicly dismiss meme coins as not what the crypto industry is really about. One crypto lobbyist told Politico that the $Trump meme coin was \"a horrible look for the industry already trying to make the case that we're not a bunch of hucksters, scammers, and fraudsters.\" However, many crypto diehards, including avowed Trump supporters, often discreetly admit on X, on LinkedIn, and in other various corners of the internet that most of the crypto markets are comprised of meme coins, or things like them. In a just or rational world, the first order of business for the president's promised crypto working group would be focusing on this $TRUMP coin. The venture presents a mind-boggling number of potential conflicts of interest and signals a financial regulatory apparatus that preys upon rather than protects Americans. Here are just a few concerns among many: What the heck is the use case for $TRUMP? If this really is a collectible, like a baseball card, it is difficult to imagine a practical use for $TRUMP other than enjoyment (and you can enjoy the image online and the sideshow for free). You can enjoy them and sell them to other collectors, but you cannot use them in the economy. You could own a $12 million Mickey Mantle card , but you cannot buy a cheeseburger with it. What does being the crypto capital of the world mean if it is only based on gambling on unregulated internet memes? If $TRUMP is a genuine financial instrument, would any Trump-nominated financial regulator take on the president? If meme coins are really financial instruments with value and meaning to the economy, financial regulators should make sure that coin issuers disclose the risks, that meme coins meet minimum standards to protect investors, and that the tokens are not subject to market manipulation. The Trump organization holds 80 percent of the $TRUMP coins. Will Trump-nominated regulators stand up for investors or kowtow to a president who demands total obedience? Will Congress' proposed crypto legislation hold the industry accountable, or just normalize bad behavior, including the issuance of $TRUMP coin? The crypto industry is demanding that Congress pass new legislation to lightly regulate crypto markets, including meme coins like $TRUMP -- in place of existing financial rules. Would the president's support for that kind of bill be contingent on whether it hurts or helps his personal investments? Could $TRUMP purchases violate ethics rules or the Constitution? Purchases of $TRUMP coin arguably give foreign governments and private interests a virtual, quasi-anonymous way to curry favor with the president, anytime, anywhere. Every investor helps to buoy the price of $TRUMP and thus enriches the president. The Constitution prohibits foreign leaders from giving such gifts without congressional consent, but it would be nearly impossible for the public to discover whether Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, or any other leader bought $TRUMP. Will financial regulators, ethics watchdogs, or Congress prevent the president's crypto ventures from becoming a fast-track vehicle for corrupt pay-to-play politics? Or will they cash in on the craze themselves? Trump, more than ever, is an incredibly recognizable brand -- from The Apprentice to two successful bids for office. It's also been associated with a litany of questionable consumer products and investment opportunities. There are defunct airlines and bankrupt casinos; Trump golf courses, high-rise hotels, and condo developments; eyebrow-raising products like Trump-endorsed bibles and gold sneakers; and now this. These ventures have often allegedly fleeced their ardent customers. For example, Trump University paid $25 million to settle allegations that its real estate classes were really infomercials that bamboozled its students (without admitting guilt) weeks before he took the oath of office in 2017. But the critical difference between the prior hucksterisms and this Trump crypto scheme is that it aligns with the interests of rich crypto bros who want to seize the reins of government to make themselves even richer. The crypto industry, led by firms like Coinbase and Ripple, want any action or vote on crypto matters -- or even potential nominees' opinions on crypto matters -- to be treated as a political litmus test. And they're succeeding. Before the winter holidays, the crypto industry's lobbying blitz scuttled the renomination of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member, Caroline Crenshaw. She was first nominated for the Democratic seat by Trump and received unanimous Senate support in 2017. While Crenshaw had expressed some concerns about crypto industry practices, she had taken few formal positions. But the crypto industry went to the mat against her -- including with an ominous box truck ad driven around Washington -- not because she was an opponent, but because she did not prostrate herself enough before almighty crypto. The Trump administration is quickly filling its ranks with crypto- and corporate-friendly appointees to make this more possible. NoCorporateCabinet.org , a project led by Demand Progress Education Fund and the Revolving Door Project, is tracking these figures, and has already identified multiple would-be appointees with potential conflicts of interests, including wealthy businessmen like David Sacks (slated to be the crypto czar, Paul Atkins (Trump's nominee to lead the SEC), and Howard Lutnick (nominated to lead the Commerce Department). This crypto power grab has implications beyond crypto. If the crypto bros get their way, it will mean a government with little interest in protecting investors, preventing fraud, holding companies accountable, and making sure people don't get ripped off by big banks, Wall Street, or financial apps. If crypto prevails and wheedles its way into the broader financial system, the next crypto crash could reverberate across the economy and take out more than just the fleeced crypto investors. In the meantime, Trump and his family are sitting pretty atop a pile of $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins. His supporters may not be so lucky: One $TRUMP coin buyer posted, \"This is awful my life is over\" on Reddit, with a picture showing they had already lost nearly $700,000 on their Trump Meme investment, due to wild fluctuations in the coin's price. If this is the crypto revolution, it sounds like another Wall Street scheme. Who will be left holding the bag?\n"

      "A gun with three bullets; one man dead on the pavement, one man in custody. From a distance, the death of Brian Thompson looks like any other in a uniquely violent America. But the circumstances surrounding his murder were unimaginable just two weeks ago: A reclusive gunman partially built a gun on the computer and assassinated the chairman of America's most powerful health insurance company. As far as we can tell, the alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione , was radicalized neither by QAnon conspiracy theories nor by undercover federal agents , but by months of self-isolation following a spinal surgery that left him in chronic pain, against a health care system so fundamentally brutal that an unexpectedly large, atypically nonpartisan cohort of the population took to the internet to mock the victim . It was an impolite reaction, with unusual savagery -- not even a moment for \"thoughts and prayers\" -- which has been examined to death over the past few weeks. In a December 17 YouGov/The Economist poll , Mangione's net approval among respondents, while negative overall, is 15 points higher than that of Congress. He comes out positive or even among respondents 44 and younger. A former federal prosecutor said he's \"never seen an alleged murderer receive such sympathy.\" Even fellow Italian-Americans rallied to Luigi's aid: A pizza place a couple miles from Mangione's high school put up a Luigi poster . I can offer no new insight about how shocking the response to Thompson's murder has been, or how thin the threshold is between the politesse of acceptable average American decorum and an ecstatic celebration of violence. I, personally, wish every family be spared the fate of the Thompsons. I also wish every family be spared the fate to which the bone-grinding machine that Brian Thompson sat atop condemns millions of others. So long as we tolerate the existence of health insurance for profit, no one will be spared. Fundamental to the experience of being an American is the constant suspicion that you're being scammed. Some of those suspicions are internet-induced prodromal schizophrenia : Not every Home Depot parking lot is a human-trafficking PokeStop; tap water won't turn your kids trans . But Americans are constant targets. We are bombarded day and night by emails, phone calls, and text messages from people who want money from us under false (or flimsy ) pretenses. The infrastructure of daily life has been ceded to Silicon Valley executives, who have mangled their indispensable products in order to make as much money for their shareholders as possible, even as this rot makes those products shittier . Throw on the TV to watch a basketball game with a friend and you'll be Clockwork Orange 'd with dozens of advertisements for apps that exploit cutting-edge advancements in gambling psychology to create life-ruining addictions -- with to-the-hilt support from sports leagues, lawmakers, and universities . Even the genocide in Gaza has become fodder for Twitter and Bluesky scammers running fraudulent fundraisers -- possibly the most revolting con I've ever encountered, and one which I now barely notice as I tune it out three or four times a day. Nowhere is the scam woven more tightly into our cool national fabric than in health insurance. The arrangement of our health finance system is lethal and inordinately expensive . Here, alone among peer countries, sickness makes you poor, poverty makes you sick, and any fever, fall, or freak accident, nor matter how slight, can quickly become a ritual of humiliation, degradation, bankruptcy, or death. Few are spared and none are distant. Over 20 million Americans have started a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to address medical costs; one in five American adults have donated to one. Only 12 percent of these campaigns reach their goals . We all know what happens to the losers: debt, if they're lucky; death, if they're not. Having insurance does not spare you from these horrors. Some of the worst health care horror stories you'll ever hear come from people with health insurance. Yet without insurance, things can be even worse; the same punishments somehow magnified. Soren Mau writes about the \" mute compulsion \" of capitalism: You gotta play the game or else you don't eat. Health insurance works the same way. Get in the pit, and you might go bankrupt and your kid might die from cancer; stay out, and you will go bankrupt; your kid will die. It is essential to the perpetuation of American society as it currently exists that we are trained to view this as the natural course of events. David Roth of Defector explained why in his reflection on the 2024 election. \"Everywhere, in every way, American culture works to prise people apart and keep them confused and worried and mean; this is much easier to do when people think of themselves only as themselves, and not as part of any greater community or project, which is why America's reactionaries have so dedicated themselves to tearing down or splitting up those kinds of communities and projects,\" Roth writes. \"This is a good way to keep people working and shopping and pliable, but it is also corrosive and lonely.\" In a vacuum, it is unsurprising for any American to go mad when confronted with this atrocity; in the real world, we are made hopeless by the state-sponsored agreement that this quiet violence is the ordinary cost of doing business. Mangione's manifesto -- or, at least, the one attributed to him -- describes a need to resolve the contradiction between what everyone knows and what everyone has to believe with lead and \"brutal honesty.\" This is not a desirable arrangement, and the last serious attempt to reform American health finance, the Affordable Care Act, along with its subsequent decade of slapdash policy tweaks, failed to prevent the conditions that made this assassination possible. These tiny reforms, as titanic and final as they're sold to us as, will continue to fail. The terrible mountain of bodies and its shadow of mass suffering are normal, expected outcomes for the American model of health finance. There is no recourse in the existing health care system, and we are offered no vehicle for change in mainstream politics. What happened on December 4 was unique in that it was an inversion of the violence which undergirds our heath finance model. The only possible rearrangement of health finance in America that can prevent this continual onslaught of death is a single-payer health care system like Medicare for All . Absent a political movement, this murder will become nothing but a memento mori -- a meme around which distressingly online Zoomer dance clubs will throw occasional theme nights throughout the duration of Mangione's trial, until we all forget about it and pay next year's ever-higher premiums, angrier and poorer but submitting still to the extortion into which we have been born. Shit is fucked up and bullshit . Part of the reason everyone and their maxed-out 401k is writing essays about The Scandalous Reaction to the Assassination is that frustration with American health finance has metastasized to an extent that modern political and media institutions are unable to taxonomize. Hating health insurance is no longer identifiable as a specifically left-wing position, which is scary to people who make their trade confidently telling you how the world works. We now live in the era of \"Bailamos\" -- nothing is forbidden anymore . Based on the reaction to the assassination, the vibrant Medicare for All movement pre-2020, and every interaction I've ever had talking to people about their health care, I know you know you're being fucked over. Let me explain how. The fundamental tension of American health finance is this: It's very expensive to take care of sick people, and it's not profitable to pay for their health care. The American approach toward this problem has been a patchwork series of accidents, union struggles, government subsidies, and tax incentives that over 70 years developed in more-or-less unguided fits and bursts. This isn't controversial or secret; all the C-levels making bank off the arrangement sit around looking at the State of Things, write \"Wow, look at all these complicated problems!\" in The New York Times or wherever, then go home to sit surrounded by the tremendous piles of money they've accumulated by their maintenance of the problems they lament. Nobody (or, at least, nobody normal ) can afford to pay for their own health care completely out-of-pocket. Thus the invention of insurance: Everyone puts a little bit into the pot (this would be your insurance premium ), and when it's your turn to receive health care -- when you have a kid, or get bitten by a raccoon, or come down with lupus -- you take a share of the accumulated pile of money to pay for it (or, in the United States, some of it). Not many people need health care at the same time, and for the people who do need it, can be very expensive. In a given year, 50 percent of medical expenses come from 5 percent of the population . The borders of this 5 percent are porous; in much the same way that poverty works, some years you're in need, and most years you aren't. In America, we largely delegate the function of insurance to private, for-profit companies (don't let Blue Cross Blue Shield's \"not-for-profit\" status fool you ). Thing is, private companies really don't want to pay for sick people's health care -- it's expensive, and spending a lot of money is a hard way to make a profit. Meanwhile, the price of care increases every year, totally unassociated with how much health care people receive. So insurers raise the price of premiums, and finagle little ways to saddle you with more and more of the cost: deductibles, copays, and claim denials. In the 1960s, the government stepped in. Poor people (who couldn't afford premiums) and elderly people (who are generally much more expensive than younger people to insure, and therefore couldn't afford their premiums either) were dying uninsured. Horror story after horror story and protest after protest wielded by well-organized advocacy groups shocked the machinery of the state into action, leading to the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, which generally insure elderly and poor or disabled people respectively. Insurers were effectively spared the costs of insuring people who need health care -- an arrangement they found could only be improved with the introduction of privatized Medicare and Medicaid plans about 30 years later. Now, thanks to generous and easily gameable government subsidies, otherwise unprofitable patients can live up to their potential and be cash cows for private insurers, though privatized Medicare is becoming a slightly less tantalizing option as senior citizens begin actually using their insurance plans again following a lull during the height of the COVID pandemic. You might see some pundit or another wriggle his pudgy little nose and point out that everyone getting mad about insurance is being irrational -- after all, UnitedHealthcare \"only\" turns a 6 percent profit ! They neglect to mention that 6 percent comes from $280 billion -- $16 billion we pay to one company alone that doesn't go toward anyone's health care. That's not even counting the roughly 17 percent private insurers spend on administrative costs, about six times what Medicare spends on administration. Depending on how you measure it, between $500 billion and over $1 trillion of our total national health care expenditures went to administrative costs, largely generated by the card-shuffling between providers and insurers. The CEOs of insurance companies will whine about how costs are increasing. They're correct! But the insurance industry altogether isn't really that upset. The amount of money they're required to spend on health care (their \"Medical Loss Ratio,\" or MLR) is a fixed percentage of their total premium revenue, often 15 percent, and if costs keep going up, so too do premiums -- good news for your insurer, who now gets to keep 15 percent of $60 billion (or whatever) instead of 15 percent of $50 billion. This is not meant to depict health care providers as blameless. There's a lot of waste in health care. Prices are totally unmoored from costs. Two MRIs from the exact same MRI machine can have a 4.5x cost difference based on who's paying for them. Pharmaceutical companies perform incredible sleight of hand to artificially extend monopolies on expensive drugs, and Congress for years has banned Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. Sometimes there's outright fraud , usually perpetrated on the most vulnerable patients -- 90 percent of hysterectomies are unnecessary . Doctors, human as any of us (despite what they might like you to believe), often prescribe on faulty memory, professional superstition, and vibes, not current scientific evidence . Hospitals go to great lengths to make pricing completely opaque -- list prices are artificially inflated as a method of negotiating better prices from insurers, so uninsured patients are stuck with insane costs. Giant nonprofit megahospitals routinely hide information about financial assistance from eligible patients while paying their workers so little they have to open food banks for their own employees . The rot runs deep. America's private insurance network is supposed to be a counterweight to all this graft. It's failed; after 70 years, we must consider that perhaps it doesn't want to succeed. Insurers focus on reducing the amount of health care people seek instead of taking on the prices at the core of the problem of health care spending. (\" It's the prices, stupid ,\" quipped legendary health economist Uwe Reinhardt.) Provider-payer squabbling is largely kayfabe: No matter what happens, the people making money keep making money, the overwhelming majority of it from the government, while individual workers or patients are left to suffer. It's hard to quantify how many people die because of our health care system alone, because it's hard to distinguish un- or underinsurance from things like gun violence or overdoses within the gap between America's excess mortality rate and those of peer countries. What we can quantify about the impacts of our health finance system on poverty is staggering: 44 percent of working-age Americans are either uninsured or underinsured, meaning they have insurance too expensive for them to use. KFF finds that 41 percent of American adults carry debt from medical or dental bills, while the Commonwealth Fund finds that 14 percent of adults under 65 have medical debt of over $2,000. One in five adults with medical debt think they'll never be able to pay it off . Commonwealth found that nearly 60 percent of underinsured adults avoided seeking health care because they were afraid of the cost. Two-thirds of adults who avoided care because of cost said their problems had worsened because of it. Poverty has a stronger association with mortality than nearly any other cause around -- the only things that cause more deaths than poverty are smoking, cancer, and heart disease. There's no room for equivocation: Health care costs kill people. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Brian Thompson's UnitedHealthcare and the fourth-largest corporation in America by revenue, was essentially designed in the great laboratory of the market to demonstrate how this all happens. STAT News has been on the beat for a long time, and this year Maureen Tkacik put the company in her crosshairs at the American Prospect. Here are some of the tactics UHG and other health insurers use to game the system: Nearly two centuries ago, Friedrich Engels coined the term \"social murder\" to describe how the living conditions that led to the premature deaths of British workers were, though occluded, not natural accidents but the product of aggregated political decisions in service of the normal function of the economy. The framework fits in America, too; as much as one man shooting another is an act of killing, so too is the arrangement of companies, institutions, and incentives that result in poor men dying up to 15 years sooner than rich men, white people living five years longer than Black people, and an 8-year difference in life expectancies between poor and rich ZIP codes five or six miles apart. Many have pointed to Mangione's spirited Goodreads review of Industrial Society and Its Future -- better known as Ted Kaczynski's \"Unabomber Manifesto\" -- as foreshadowing the assassination. Kaczynski argued that the technological developments of mass society inevitably dominate and restrict human autonomy and that the only paths available to preserve human freedom were revolution or withdrawal. In light of the \"nursing home AI\" scandal, it is tempting to draw a parallel between the American health finance system and the powers of the Industrial Revolution Kaczynski lamented: Both are domineering forces that relentlessly reorder humans around the whims of technology. But that lets the people who put us here off the hook. Nobody's put it better than epidemiologist and writer Abby Cartus . \"I think it matters whether we want to understand the health insurance industry and its evils as an autonomous technical behemoth, superficially at the level of algorithmic decisions , or whether we want to understand it as a way of organizing technological and economic resources, incentives, and choices given the political-economic structure of capitalism,\" Cartus writes. She continues: \"The former -- the story of autonomous technology -- strips away the industry's guilt and [...] misdirects attention that should be focused like a white-hot laser beam on the real problem: private, for-profit health care, and the thugs who administer it.\" Viewing the social murder of American health finance as some sort of uncontrolled, ambient force that, like a ghost or a dog , just does things arbitrarily, is to excuse the aggregate human decisions which create and maintain this condition. The wretched circumstance of health finance in America may not be intentional, but neither is it accidental. It emerges directly from its organization according to the sole principle of having to create shareholder value. December 4 isn't how things are supposed to work. Executives are supposed to look down from atop the great murder machine, not get crushed under its weight. Judging by the rush of calls to personal security firms from the moneymaker class and the small army of cops New York City Mayor Eric Adams led to march Mangione to his arraignment, this sudden inversion scares the hell out of them. But violence -- the loud kind -- will inevitably erupt from an institution created and nourished by acts of violence. Brian Thompson may not have pulled any triggers himself -- his friends describe \"BT\" as a decent man concerned with the state of American health care, God bless him; aren't they all. As the executive of the most powerful private insurer in America, the core of the most powerful private medical entity in the world, he commanded an institution inseparable from the American machine of social murder. If all lives are equal, then all deaths are too. What do the Mangione fundraisers , the club nights, Ben Shapiro's YouTube comment section , the stickers, the TikTok folk hero ballads mean ? They mean that a lot of people hate their insurance -- a lot -- in a way that transcends conventional ideology or political expression. Part of the reason the reaction to the shooting came as such a shock is that many people who tip poorly or write newspaper columns assumed the frustration about American health insurance was limited to the cranks and unwashed longhairs of the Medicare for All movement, which had been cauterized quickly and painfully after Joe Biden seized the Democratic nomination in 2020. Policy decisions since have reflected this self-assurance, throwing yet more public money into the pit of for-profit companies: Among the most substantial health finance policy achievements of Biden's presidency was increasing subsidies to insurance companies selling individual marketplace plans. These subsidies have become load-bearing insurance infrastructure, and without their projected $335 billion over the next decade, millions of people will be even less able to afford their health care. Gains made under the Affordable Care Act have been erased. More people are insured than they were before the ACA, but many more people are underinsured . Some premiums for employer-sponsored insurance plans have increased by 50 percent since 2011; out-of-pocket spending (in addition to premiums) is up 16 percent from where it was pre-ACA. The Affordable Care Act was a series of elaborate bribes designed to persuade the for-profit entities that run American health care to be a little less ferocious; a decade later, Cerberus has broken free of his leash. Every policy tweak in the mold of the past 10 years of American health policy will fare similarly: They are little more than incredibly expensive bandages slapped onto an ever-spreading wound. The refusal of the 2020-2024 Democrats to reject the limitless money of the profiteers and seize on the deep bipartisan fury against the health insurance system was a predictable (some might say inevitable), disastrous, and world-changing own-goal. While most of the party is focused on making sure nothing ever changes , some politicians trying to catch the spirit have come out to wring their hands and talk about how we need reform. They and many others will suggest policies over the next few months -- some lightweight, like restricting AI oversight of claim denials; some essential but incomplete, like antitrust legislation against UnitedHealth and its peers. Elected officials are incapable of doing anything more unless they are willing to jettison the idea that health care should be arranged according to the whims of shareholder value -- an idea lodged, like Excalibur, into the foundation of our political economy. They, or their low- VORP successors, will be unwilling to do so unless there is concerted political effort to demand it. This is not a question of policy, but power. Individual acts of violence will not bring about the systemic reforms required to obviate the institutionalized extortion of private insurance. I don't imagine a mass militia of patients will (or should) rise up and revolt against their medical oppressors with an armory of 3D-printed guns. If anything, the extremely \"median voter\" ideology of Mangione instead suggests the potential for a massive political coalition that can be directed toward serious health care reform. We can find inspiration from how ADAPT and other disability rights organizations organized in mass groups and threw their bodies on the line to preserve Medicaid financing and the Affordable Care Act under Donald Trump. We can look to Reclaim Idaho , the nonpartisan mass movement that expanded Medicaid in the state through a ballot referendum in 2018. We should not find solace in campaign promises toward tweaky minor reforms that, through their victories, kill momentum for more serious change. Whether you believe health care is a human or civil right or if you just want to maximize efficiency while guaranteeing universal coverage, the only policy path forward is an expanded and improved Medicare for All , a system in which premiums and deductibles are replaced with fairly distributed taxes and all health care spending is paid by the federal government, which uses its tremendous purchasing power to drive costs down and guarantees patients need spend nothing out-of-pocket. Twenty-two separate studies , including one by the conservative Mercatus Center, find that some version of Medicare for All or another would save money compared to our current privatized arrangement. Other countries' health care models instruct us that any introduction of fragmented, privatized insurance creates gaps into which the sickest or poorest people fall. I have argued elsewhere that a Medicare for All model is absolutely necessary (but not sufficient in and of itself) to address the larger problems which sicken and kill the people we love. It's been five fallow years for health justice. Is this the spark we need, or is it just a directionless moment of cultural catharsis? Will Brian Thompson's death bring us to the doors of our neighbors, the halls of our legislatures, and the streets of our cities? Will someone -- a union leader, a politician, a community organization -- be able to capitalize on this kinetic energy the way Bernie Sanders did, this time more prepared to face the extreme resistance of capital, or is the conquest of the boardroom over the living room absolute? I'm not optimistic, but I'm hopeful; I'm putting my boots on. I gotta. There is no alternative but the nihilism of lonely Luigi Mangione.\n"

      "When President-elect Donald Trump chose the television commentator Pete Hegseth as his nominee for secretary of defense, a panoply of national security stalwarts -- retired generals and admirals, former appointees, and elected officials -- evinced surprise. Some of us found the defense establishment getting caught off guard par for the course. Really? On a scale of the Islamic State capturing Fallujah in 2014 to the Afghan military collapsing before the Taliban in 2021 , how surprising was it? The choice of Hegseth -- whose highest position of military authority was as a mid-level National Guard officer -- is certainly unconventional. There's no guarantee he will be confirmed, and he could well be forced to drop out amid sexual assault allegations. But the nomination of an extreme, anti-establishment crusader like Hegseth was predictable. Trump's re-election means the upheavals have just begun. While many will celebrate a cultural shakeup at the Pentagon , they may not like the direction it takes. Hegseth is \"the wrong person delivering the wrong message at the wrong moment,\" one former Airborne officer tells Rolling Stone . \"But it comes from a sincere place of frustration and discontent.\" Washington pretended Afghanistan was turning the corner for decades. But the truth was exposed when Kabul fell to the Taliban in August 2021, with crowds of refugees clambering aboard C-17s, while Marines were blown up guarding the perimeter at Abbey Gate. The bloody debacle was seared into American memory, as surely as pictures of helicopters lifting off from the roof of the Embassy in Saigon in 1975. There has never been an accounting for the grand failures of the Global War on Terror , or GWOT. Not for the lies, like the non-existent Weapons of Mass Destruction used as a pretext to invade Iraq; not for the incompetence at the outset of the occupation and ensuing sectarian bloodshed that killed 4,507 Americans and 110,600 Iraqis between 2003 and 2009. Not for dropping the ball in Afghanistan, squandering the lives of 70,000 U.S. coalition and Afghan security forces and $2 trillion in treasure, and shoring up venal warlords in pursuit of an elusive fantasy: that America could turn a failed state into a modern nation. The lack of accountability pisses people off. There is fury in the hearts of those who served in these wars. \"The people who think there's been a string of failures are naturally attracted to the person who wants to break the system,\" says a former Explosive Ordnance Disposal officer. \"Because the system is not working.\" The Trump administration plans to harness that rage and direct it at its enemies. It intends to prosecute military leaders for the Afghanistan withdrawal, even going so far as to recall officers to active duty so they can be court-martialed. That may be a daydream, but what many people want is someone to blame for America losing. Trump and his supporters don't want reform, they want revenge. They want blood. \"These generals lied. They mismanaged. They violated their oath. They failed. They disgraced our troops, and our nation. They got people killed, unnecessarily,\" Hegseth wrote in his recently published book, The War on Warriors . \"And, to this moment, they keep their jobs. Worse, they continue to actively erode our military and its values -- by capitulating to civilians with radical agendas. They are an embarrassment, with stars still on their shoulders.\" Hegseth isn't just a thumb in the eye of the career brass. Trump also intends to purge generals he doesn't like. After decades of disastrous strategy and policy overreach at the Pentagon, Hegseth is meant to be the reckoning. Since Hegseth's nomination was announced, commentators have bemoaned his tattoos and beliefs, and exposed infidelities, hypocrisies, and potential crimes. Some of these appear to have surprised even the Trump transition team , including reports that Hegseth paid off a woman who accused him of a 2017 sexual assault, and forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement. That the settlement happened was confirmed by his lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, but Hegseth denies accusations the incident in question was sexual assault. Rather than try to convince anyone Hegseth is a good or bad choice, this reporter would rather explain why he was chosen. How does one go from a small town, to GWOT military service, to the New York City media bubble? Well, as it turns out, there's someone who has an idea how that might happen: yours truly. Hegseth and I went to the same elementary school in Forest Lake, Minnesota -- a town of about 6,000 people when we lived there in the early 80s, although I later moved to Colorado. He was a High School sophomore when I joined the Marines; I left the military just before he deployed to Kabul in the National Guard. While Hegseth was onscreen at Fox News , I was a few blocks down Avenue of the Americas at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, backfilling on NBC Nightly News from my then-post as an international field producer based in London. I've never met Hegseth. He was too young to be in my class at Forest Lake Elementary; I guess it's possible we attended daycare in the basement of a local church together. I worked with various National Guard units over the years, but never the Minnesota Guard. Our paths never crossed in the military or in television. I don't want to push this too far. We've had different lives and careers. The point is, Hegseth's experiences are not alien to me. An important period is from 2007 to 2011. After the invasion of Iraq became a mire of occupation, as Afghanistan became increasingly deadly and America's goals unclear, many military professionals doubled down on the warrior ethos. They became what one of my platoon commanders acerbically dubbed \"Born-Again Hard.\" A lot of military personnel responded to Forever War with fanatical devotion to the profession of arms, seeking to mold themselves into perfect warriors -- as if the American Century could be defended solely through max reps and personal asceticism. We would learn that no CrossFit routine could box jump America to victory; no Sparta kick could banish strategic mistakes. But in 2007 there was still hope, and amid \"the Surge\" in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus appeared as a media-savvy prophet, bearing a new gospel of deliverance: FM 3-24, aka the Counterinsurgency (COIN) Field Manual. Many servicemembers -- myself included -- devoured the book, hoping to locate in its pages the wisdom needed to keep people alive, accomplish the mission, and make America proud. Hegseth was a disciple, penning an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal called \"Give the Surge a Chance,\" appearing on C-SPAN to elaborate . \"We've got the right strategy, with the right general, and he's making progress -- and he needs to be given the time and the resources necessary to see that strategy through,\" Hegseth declared. It worked -- or seemed to. Attacks on American forces declined. There remains fierce debate about what Petraeus actually achieved in Iraq. Certainly this reporter can introduce the reader to several Marines who tell a different story, one about the Anbar Awakening and Sunni leaders rejecting Al Qaeda after the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. No matter. Washington was convinced: COIN would win GWOT. Petraeus was sent to Afghanistan with his gospel, in the hope of replicating his Surge miracles. \"It was a weird moment, between Iraq 'working,' and before trying it in Afghanistan,\" says one former infantry captain. \"At least it felt like something different.\" In 2011, Petraeus left both Afghanistan and the Army, briefly taking over the CIA before a short-lived fall-from-grace related to an extramarital affair with his biographer. You can still see him on TV sometimes. Hegseth was sent to Kabul to serve as a counterinsurgency instructor in 2012, joining legions of soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Marines who would spend years helping to build security forces that could stand on their own. Needless to say, it didn't work. In 2020, the Trump administration negotiated an end to the conflict with the Taliban, known as the Doha Accord. President Joe Biden inherited the plan, and the 20-year imperial project to build a self-sustaining government and military imploded in the space of four months in 2021. COIN did not save Afghanistan from the Taliban. \"I'm sure he's walked back the belief, but he was a true believer,\" says an Army officer acquainted with Hegseth, pointing to his COIN advocacy. He added many Americans were lulled by a strategy that donned \"the guise of temporary victory.\" America may run on Dunkin', but it's built on fear. It always has been. Fear of slave rebellions; fear of Indian attacks; fear of Japanese invasion; fear of Communist infiltrators; fear of immigrants; fear of terrorists. Warrior philosophies are meant to be an antidote to fear. The GWOT warrior's obsession with physical fitness and combat arts leached out of the military onto American society in a kind of \"tacticool\" osmosis, until office workers were carrying backpacks bedecked with MOLLE straps; men experiencing mid-life crises were practicing close-quarters-battle drills at weekend camps; an ever-increasing share of disposable income was exchanged for an endless variety of attachments for the Picatinny rails on AR-15s. Martial pastimes ebbed and flowed back-and-forth across the civil-military divide, mutated versions ingesting extreme politics and fringe philosophies. Many men gravitated toward these, insecurity and doubt replaced by aggression and intolerance; fear and uncertainty replaced by guns and testosterone. Christian nationalism -- ever present through American history -- became a small but influential cult within the military during this period, repackaged in reactionary alt-right politics, but with the same old message as always: There is but one true faith, and America is its beacon. I've encountered such people for years: The young petty officer who argued \"the founders meant freedom of religion to apply only to Christians\" while I was deployed aboard U.S.S. Essex ; the Marine reservist who asserted that, historically, Christianity's adherents only become violent when forced to defend their faith; the Army Special Forces major who lectured me at a forward operating base about how Islam was the greatest threat to Western civilization; the airman with the tattoo of an armored Templar, helping me load gear onto a contracted turboprop at an airfield in Africa. Hegseth, too, became an adherent. Much discourse about Hegseth's nomination has centered around his ink, his Jerusalem Cross and his Deus Vult tattoos. People have been fighting over the meaning of the Crusades and hijacking their imagery and symbols for a thousand years, and they'll likely do it for a thousand more. Good luck sorting it out to everyone's satisfaction. But if you are surprised that devout Christians pop up with symbols of their faith tattooed on their body, you probably haven't spent much time around the military. Obviously there is more to this than Hegseth just really liking Orlando Bloom's performance in Kingdom of Heaven , or being a fan of the Swedish author Jan Guillou's crusader novel, The Road to Jerusalem . Atavistic fantasizing about Templars, or keeping Outremer out of the hands of Saracens, doesn't have a lot of relevance to modern defense policy. But Hegseth's writings and statements do. His book American Crusade calls for \"a holy war for the righteous cause of human freedom.\" Yeah, ok. I like freedom. Tell me more. \"Our present moment is much like the 11th Century. We don't want to fight, but, like our fellow Christians one thousand years ago, we must,\" Hegseth writes. Hmm. A lot of inexactitude in two sentences, but I get it. Reluctant warriors. So what's our target, Major? \"Islamism is the most dangerous threat to freedom in the world. It cannot be negotiated with, coexisted with, or understood; it must be exposed, marginalized, and crushed... American leftists insist on pursuing the very same policies that led to the cultural invasion in Europe.\" Well, ok then. We're gonna invade modernity and lay siege to multicultural liberalism, not liberate Jerusalem from infidels. Got it. The National Guard took a dim view of Hegseth's tattoos in the context of vetting soldiers assigned to the inauguration of Joe Biden in 2021. \"The phrase 'Deus Vult' is associated with Supremacist groups in which White-Supremacist use of #DeusVult and a return to medieval Catholicism, is to invoke a white Christian (i.e. Catholic) medieval past that wishes to ignore the actual demographics and theological state of Catholicism today,\" wrote Master Sgt. DeRicko Gaither, charged with identifying \"insider threats,\" in an email to commanders explaining concerns over Hegseth. Although religious intolerance and ethnic chauvinism often go hand-in-hand, calling Hegseth a white supremacist is a stretch, and lacks nuance. He is a militant Christian nationalist. In case there are doubts: \"Our American Crusade is not about literal swords, and our fight is not with guns. Yet ,\" Hegseth writes in his book, himself adding the emphasis to \"yet.\" What did America think was going to happen when it sent warriors out into the world to battle Islamic extremists for two decades, watching friends die or lose limbs, only to realize in the end all that suffering and sacrifice accomplished nothing noble or worthwhile? Some of America's warriors are lost. They don't know where we're going or how we're getting there. But they hear a clear voice coming over the navigation system, and it's saying: \"Make a hard right turn onto Christian Militant Lane.\" I asked an Air Force officer if he thought the War on Woke was the descendant of the War on Terror. He scoffed, saying \"the only place people still talk about GWOT is in VFW halls.\" But when I mentioned the plan to prosecute leaders for the Afghanistan withdrawal, it clicked. \"Well, getting stuck in Kabul, I took that personally, and may not be 100 percent opposed to that,\" he said. Several military members Rolling Stone spoke with deride Hegseth's focus on \"culture war bullshit,\" with one saying that combating \"Wokeism\" as the \"imaginary reason he thinks responsible for our loss in GWOT\" was just a modern version of the old \"Dolchstoss myth,\" the \"stab-in-the-back\" legend that became pervasive across Germany in the aftermath of World War I -- the belief that the German Army wasn't defeated on the battlefield, rather, it was betrayed by communists and Jews on the homefront. The current, Americanized version of this myth blames the nation's failures on DEI, or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies -- and still communists, but only in the sense that \"communist\" is now just a generic pejorative. And it informs the worldview in which Hegseth confidently exclaims: \"I'm straight up just saying, we shouldn't have women in combat roles.\" In his 2024 book, the Fox News contributor put it in expressly partisan terms: \"Do we really want only the woke 'diverse' recruits that the Biden administration is curating to be the ones with the guns and the guidons?\" In this world, the enemy is feminists, gays, diversity, vegans, soy milk -- anything and everything that distracts the warfighter from executing pure violence to achieve the mission of protecting America. Like the Laws of Armed Conflict. There isn't much new to say about Hegseth's involvement in getting several convicted or accused war criminals pardoned by Trump during his first term. It's surreal to have to point out the prevailing view in the military -- for ethical, legal, and practical reasons -- remains that war crimes are bad, actually . You can always find puffed-up poseurs in the military, swaggering around saying \"war has no rules.\" But that idea is problematic in a professional military unit. Few want to serve beside an armed psychopath with no regard for human life, who enjoys torturing or executing prisoners or murdering civilians -- which is why in the cases of the three people Trump pardoned, members of their own units testified against them. Hegseth's claim that the \"woke\" laws of war are \"why America hasn't won a war since World War II\" makes little sense. Even General Douglas MacArthur -- not exactly known for his Marxist proclivities -- personally signed the order to hang an American soldier convicted of murdering civilians during World War II. In all, there were more than 140 such executions for violations of the Articles of War -- rape, murder, or both -- from 1941 to 1945. It's true that no amount of renaming military bases, ordering stand-downs to address extremism, or revising the policies on trans servicemembers would have won Afghanistan. Banning the transgendered, whining about women passing Ranger School, or gloves-off war-criming wouldn't have done it, either. Perhaps these are important battles in the fight to shape American society, but they are irrelevancies to the actual wars America lost. But if people want a myth about why that happened, Hegseth has one. Democrats tried, but found it impossible to convince many voters that Trump doesn't love the military. Because he does. He loves the pageantry and trappings of power, he loves thundering boots on parade, and choreographed displays of might. He saluted a North Korean general, for heaven's sake. If anything, Trump loves the military a little too much. At the outset of his first administration, Trump loved his own generals, too. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn; Maj. Gen. H.R. McMaster; Gen. James Mattis; Gen. John Kelly; Gen. Mark Milley. \"These are central casting,\" he said . \"If I'm doing a movie, I'd pick you generals.\" The public breakup with the men he once called \"my generals\" was ugly. Only Milley, who was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made it to the end of Trump's term. He's somewhere toward the top of Trump's enemies list now. Many of those who served in the first Trump administration endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the last election. They warned he was a fascist and a threat to democracy. Trump has little interest in arcane debates about the role of the military in a constitutional republic with enshrined civil liberties. Hegseth will serve at his pleasure. The gangster mentality of absolute loyalty or retribution will feed on the anti-establishment rage that is coursing through much of the armed forces. Hegseth will be the tool Trump uses to purge the Pentagon, and many will cheer him on. The real test will come when protesters are out in the streets, and the president calls on the defense secretary to deploy the military to quell civil unrest. That's not hypothetical. It already happened once under Trump, in June 2020, when the 82nd Airborne was called out to deal with Black Lives Matter protesters \"rampaging\" in Washington D.C. At the time, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was able to put the kibosh on the deployment, in the belief that using the military against throngs of unarmed protesters was a step too far. He didn't make it to the end of Trump's term, either. The question lingering in the mind of those I've spoken to is this: When Trump calls on Hegseth and asks him to use the military against his fellow citizens, what will he do? Pete Hegseth knows the answer to that question. The American people should know it, too.\n"

      "Democrats' convention in Chicago undoubtedly provided a contrast of sorts with the nominating convention I had covered in Milwaukee the month prior , where Donald Trump and his champagne-vomit-belching cultists were promising -- in their own pornographically violent words -- a version of Homer Simpson's line about how his \"campaign is a disaster... I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me -- I'd make them pay!\" Now, with the two party conventions in the rearview mirror, the general election between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump has kicked off in earnest. There are about two months left until Election Day in November and the stakes are -- as everyone is likely dead-tired of repeating -- insurmountably high. The fact that this has become a cliche to say doesn't make it any less true. But roaming the halls of the Democratic National Convention last week, there was another feeling I found myself unable to escape. It has continued gnawing at me. Much of what I witnessed and heard about during my time in Chicago reinforced my preexisting beliefs that far too many so-called elite members of my profession -- national political media scribes who fancy themselves as speaking truth to power, but more often just speak words to financially destructive Google algorithms -- are mollycoddled hogs who are doing everything they can to fail to meet the enormity of this moment. There was the bristling \"traditional\" media resentment towards the access and treatment the Democratic organizers and the Harris campaign afforded to social media influencers. There were times I thought I had been teleported back to 2010, when we as an industry were debating how to treat bloggers. The presence of an army of influencers or online personas made perfect sense in that the stated priority was \"media access,\" and influencers are objectively part of the media -- not to mention that many of these social media stars have significantly larger audiences than dozens of egghead reporters combined. Though many of these influencers do not maintain the august fact-finding standards of publications that helped justify the Iraq War, they should individually qualify for media credentials. There was a pulsating sense of entitlement and unearned self-love that defined many of the assembled writers and media personalities. And there was a fundamental lack of understanding about how to deal with not getting exactly what you want, when you want it. Due to the high-level attendance at this year's Democratic convention -- by the public, the press, and others -- there were, of course, moments of logistical clusterfuckery. I, too, was displeased by the long lines on day one of the 2024 DNC, a displeasure the Trump campaign has giddily attempted to exploit . And on the fourth night -- just hours prior to when Harris delivered her history-making acceptance speech as a Black and Asian-American woman -- there was a period when access to both unassigned and assigned media seats was abruptly cut off, apparently due to a degree of overcrowding that wasn't safe. I eventually got in to see Harris and others ( not Beyonce ... sad.) speak, but not before enduring the sights and maddening sounds of multi-lanyard-wearing, sweat-flecked envoys of the U.S. media elite berating the lowest-level convention volunteers to let them into their seats at once. I would be naming names at this point, if I could tell you with certainty who any of these people were, other than the fact that their respective demeanors suggested that they were accustomed to bellowing: \" Do you know who I am? \" One egregious case featured a man who went on for minutes scolding a young volunteer at a media entrance about how he did, in fact, have an assigned seat. The volunteer, citing instructions he clearly had not written himself, gently stated that he couldn't let anyone in at that time, unless they had a confirmation or an email showing their assigned seating. This journalist repeatedly insisted his name was on \"the list,\" which this volunteer politely stressed, multiple times, he did not have. The journalist huffily asked to speak to the manager -- The Manager! Christ alive! -- not long before storming off. (Not that it matters, but Rolling Stone made sure to stick around to apologize to the kid on other people's behalf, adding that we knew it was not his fault.) It may have not occurred to this man that if he were not so invested in sitting in the least desired, highest section of the arena, where the press could barely see Harris when she spoke, he could have watched the speech on C-SPAN or on the arena TVs dotted throughout the halls. His view would have been much better, and I doubt it would have altered his coverage of the acceptance speech all that much. So much of doing this job, journalism , the right way hinges only on having some sense of moral clarity and not being an asshole to people who clearly don't deserve it. It is a wonder of the modern world how many in the pampered ranks of this profession can only find it within themselves to publicly flunk this 101-level test, again and again. And throughout the four-day nominating process, holy shit was there ambient complaining about how the vice president has avoided doing lengthy sit-downs with legacy news outlets, ever since President Joe Biden dropped out and hurled the baton at a successor who could form semi-cogent sentences on the fly. Naturally, I -- as a member of a news organization that values when famous or influential people grant us on-the-record Q&As -- would personally prefer it if Harris sat down for tough, long grillings with all these media outlets, and I think she should do it now. (I will note that even though Rolling Stone had our own Harris interview that ran online in June , we would also like another one now that she is the 2024 nominee, so if her senior campaign staff are reading this parenthetical, you know where to find me. I have questions about the War on Drugs, drone warfare, and many other topics.) But complaining about literally any of these inconveniences to any meaningful degree is, in this one political reporter's judgment, an act of decadent misery at a time when our readers and peers simply cannot afford it. Anyone who knows me can tell you that I am not someone who naively views The Media as a sworn vanguard of truth and inner beauty. I am not someone who thinks it is my duty to try to bully the big-name, straight-news-gathering operations into \"picking sides\" or becoming a cushy propaganda mill for Vice President Harris or her current boss, whatever his name is. What I am saying is that much of the mainstream political press has been (correctly) programming its audience to believe this year's race is not a normal presidential election, and then too many in that media elite get upset when the public points out that they're covering it like a normal presidential election, armed with the exact same petty obsessions and pathologies. It is not, per se , an angry readership screaming at us that the stakes are too high for this shit -- we are the ones who've been yelling at them, for at least a year now, that the stakes of this presidential contest are that high! Of course, the sitting vice president and her campaign are not, by any means, paragons of virtue -- far from it. At the end of the day, she is a mere hood ornament on the contemporary Democratic Party that, through incompetence and morally criminal passivity, allowed Trump to storm into the White House and define a whole generation of American politics, policy, and judicial dominance. And yet, sitting on the other coin-toss of this presidential election is a political party and leader who are essentially promising, should they reconquer power in November, to turn the federal government into the blood orgy scene from Event Horizon , if only every cannibal space-demon in that scene were played by the villain from Happy Gilmore . I am being mildly hyperbolic, but Trump and his expected government-in-waiting have been making blatantly authoritarian , explicitly bloodlusting promises out in the open for all to hear for years , so it has been getting a little harder to ignore, as a credentialed member of the news media. On top of all of that, Trump has stridently vowed that if he doesn't get his way in this election (because among other factors, he's a man trying his damndest to stay out of prison), he and his party are prepared to steal it . It is excruciating -- annoying, even -- to have to hear politicians and the news media insist that this year's is The Most Important Election of Our Lifetimes, because all those same figures have been saying this for the decades for which I've been around. Regardless, when we are at a juncture in history like the one we're at, it is critical as ever that supposedly productive comrades of the Fourth Estate ask themselves as calmly as we can: Why is it that so many normal-brained people -- who aren't degenerate MAGA psychos -- seem to think we are falling down on the job, fixating on ourselves and our own comfort levels and \"access,\" and absolutely not earning back their trust, if we even had it to begin with? I should conclude these 2,000 words of disgruntled navel-gazing with an admission that I am, very likely, part of the problem -- given that I, too, am an Elite Media Shithead. While sprinting around Chicago during convention week, I spent far too much time figuring out which afterparties I could fleece my way into, and how many Hollywood and music A-listers I could con into throwing back a drink with me and pretending to care what I had to say. At one of the late-night Thursday celebrations, I was given (surely it must have been an accident) a VIP bracelet, which allowed me to get \"yes\" answers to ridiculous questions like, \"Can you take me backstage to meet the rapper Common before he performs?\" I was accompanied by two good friends -- talented journalists who were there to keep my head on straight and remind me how lame I was acting, as I pretended not to relish each second of proximity to celebrity and overindulgence that this evening permitted. I have long understood the seduction that comes with certain echelons of this job, where those whiffs of surprising access, whether political or otherwise, start tricking your own brain into thinking you, as well, might be Frankie Valli or some kinda big shot -- as opposed to what we largely are, which are little more than \"little piglets... gleefully inhaling the muck and empty calories at the trough of President Trump's lunacy.\" (The key to forestalling the effect of that seductiveness is being able to shout at yourself in the mirror mantras such as: \" You're a fucking nobody, now go out there and break some news .\") Now, if Vice President Harris, Gov. Tim Walz, and the Democrats faceplant in this election, they will have no one to blame but themselves. That is not mutually exclusive from the reality that vanishingly few people of any prominence -- in national newsrooms, in Hollywood, and definitely not within the neo-Confederate entrails of the modern-day Republican Party and conservative movement -- have covered themselves in the slightest glory.\n"

      "As Democrats reflect on the sources of their electoral loss, recriminations are in full swing. Following in the footsteps of Mark Lilla's 2016 op-ed that launched the genre, many have settled on blaming \" wokeness .\" In short, Democrats lost due to playing \"identity politics\": attending to the particular concerns of anyone other than straight white men who float through the world identity-free as people in their unalloyed essence. Or perhaps appearing, by proximity to interest groups , to do so. These pronouncements are more galling now as we confront authoritarian rule. The authoritarian playbook requires fomenting a counter-revolution against a revolution that never was. Their claim is that the most marginalized people in a society have somehow risen to power, and \"real citizens\" must claw it back. The assessment that Democrats' failings stem from affording immigrants and trans people too much power requires acceptance of this fiction. These electoral breakdowns and takedowns are full of data on how Kamala Harris performed with different groups of voters, in order to pronounce -- without irony -- that identity-based categories no longer have electoral meaning. And, indeed, trying to parse electoral results through the habitual lens of race, gender, educational attainment, and age doesn't offer up much explanatory power. So, perhaps those chiding Democrats for purported fixation on minority groups should consider cooling it with seeing everything through that lens. Or, at the very least, in pronouncements about \"class realignment,\" perhaps pundits could note that the people screwing over the working class are billionaires and that Democrats focused too little of their ire in that direction, given that Donald Trump has brought us to \"broligarchy.\" To be sure, we should be leery of accepting any singular explanation of the actions -- or inaction - of millions of individual Americans. Something as complex as an election cannot be summed up in any unified grand theory . But, efforts to make sense of what just happened should at least be based on... what actually happened. So, let's start by looking at that. First, we must dispense with the fiction that this was some massive shift in American political preferences. Counting continues apace but as of this writing , Harris has 48.5 percent and growing to Trump's 50 percent and falling, a 2.5 million vote difference in a pool of over 153 million votes. Hardly the mandate Dictator Donny is claiming gives him license to appoint a cabinet of kleptocrats and remake the federal government. Yet Trump did garner more votes, popular and electoral, than Harris, which merits examination. Occupying the reality-based world -- for example, correctly assessing rates of inflation, crime, and border crossing -- turns out to be a pretty solid indicator of whether people intended to vote for Harris or Trump, polling shows . So, perhaps we can say, \"it's the disinfo, stupid.\" Further, we are in a moment of global rejection of incumbent parties left and right. Since the start of the pandemic, people are looking at what their lives are right now and saying: I want something other than this. In the U.S., voters are rightly seething at the status quo, because a handful of billionaires and corporations hoard the wealth the rest of us create, purchasing politicians and Supreme Court justices to let them do as they please. Where some lament seeing trust in institutions at all-time lows, we ought instead to recognize that people are wise to the fact that \"protecting democracy\" isn't a very compelling pitch when democracy never paid their rent, let alone granted them health care or higher education. Thus, perhaps the electoral explanation is, \"it's the change, stupid.\" Critically, Harris fell short largely due to Joe Biden 's 2020 voters failing to show up. By current count, while Trump did increase his total votes by around 2.5 million, Harris received 7 million fewer votes than Biden did in 2020. Overall, the electorate shifted couchward, not rightward. Any explanation for what occurred needs to account for what drove people who delivered Democratic victory in 2020 to sit this one out. Throughout the last two years of weekly focus groups and frequent surveys with battleground state swing and disaffected Democratic voters, three things rose to the surface time and again. First, voters' strong recollection they got a check from Trump -- a payment he held up in order to sign those remittances. Biden's unsigned checks , meanwhile, didn't register, likely because he prioritized conforming to tradition over understanding there is no message louder than a personal check. The Trump checks and the price hikes that happened during Biden's tenure were tangible memories that abstract-seeming future threats could not dislodge. Heap onto this months spent hyping a signature piece of legislation as the \"Inflation Reduction Act,\" committing cardinal messaging sins. First, it has Democrats repeating the dreaded \"i-word\" time and again to voters. Next, many voters do not understand inflation is a rate of change and believe reducing it ought to have prices drop, which, of course, they largely didn't. This plus trying to tout accomplishments and make \"Bidenomics\" happen, only to walk it back, made Democrats seem out of touch. Hearing \"the economy is doing great,\" when you aren't, creates a disconnect, at best, and possibly sounds like blaming voters for their own troubles. Second, voters open to Trump or to sitting out were and still are deep in what I term the \"credulity chasm\": finding the right-wing Project 2025 agenda repugnant but waving it away as unlikely to come true. In an August survey the Research Collaborative conducted with Data for Progress, 58 percent of Democratic voters believed that Republicans would implement the Project 2025 agenda if they achieved power, with 28 percent stating they'd try but fail and 14 percent assuming they wouldn't even attempt it. In contrast, 21 percent of Republican voters perceived the Project 2025 agenda would be enacted, 28 percent said it would be attempted without success, and a majority -- 51 percent -- believed Republicans would not set out to implement this agenda. This incredulity persists. In a post-election survey the Research Collaborative fielded with Hart Research, Harris voters broke 87/13 on whether it's likely versus unlikely that Trump will deport millions of immigrants including those here legally, but Trump voters split 60/40 on this. Only 18 percent of Harris voters think a national abortion ban is unlikely, whereas 69 percent of Trump voters give this response. Indeed, on our battery of what is likely to happen under a Trump administration and the attendant outcomes, Harris and Trump voters are almost mirror opposites in their predictions. In other words, the differences between these voters cannot be summed up as hunger for disparate governing agendas but rather belief in whether policies the majority dislike will come to fruition. Third, these conflicted voters saw Democrats as unable or unwilling to fight for them. Fairly or not, \"this all happened on Democrats' watch\" -- \"this\" being the fall of Roe v. Wade , the passage of anti-voter laws, the economic struggles they faced -- was the cry of the conflicted voter. Or, as they told us frequently, \"you told me to turn out in 2020 to protect us from MAGA, I did and it did nothing. Why would I believe the same thing again?\" To wit, post election, 51 percent of voters agreed that \"Democrats talk about protecting democracy to try to get elected but haven't tried to do anything meaningful to protect it,\" as opposed to thinking Democrats had protected democracy or given it an earnest try. \"Democrats do not fight for us\" -- not pronouns or support for open borders or Black Lives Matter marches -- was the thing conflicted voters volunteered as top beefs time and again, across hundreds of focus groups. To be sure, you can prime them into grumbling about \"cultural issues,\" and Republicans certainly spent a fortune to bring these issues to the fore. But, ironically, it's Democrats' ready capitulation on these topics -- running from and not on values -- that merely adds to voters' sense they are weak. Offered full-fat and low-calorie versions of the same agenda, swing voters opt for the former and disaffected surge voters stay home. What Democrats must reckon with is that, outside of hard partisans, most voters think most politicians lie most of the time. Post election, 72 percent of voters said Republican leaders lie sometimes or always, and 70 percent said this of Democratic leaders. This is extraordinarily beneficial to Republicans, as on-the-fence voters routinely told us that \"Trump just says things, he doesn't mean them.\" And it is extraordinarily destructive to Democrats, as voters disbelieve their messages about past accomplishments, future plans, and MAGA dictatorship warnings. What people believe about Democrats is not made out of what Democrats say. That's why disavowing the right-wing and centrist critique of things Harris did not actually say during the 2024 campaign and would not have implemented as policy simply does not work. And remaining silent about issues of race, gender, and origin that Republicans keep introducing does not make them go away. It guarantees that all voters hear is the hate peddling of the opposition. The notion that voters came to love what Trump is offering and that Harris was promoting some ultra-left agenda is indefensible. Team Harris campaigned with Liz Cheney, showcased a Glock-owning, \"most lethal military\" patriotism, and promised a Republican-authored border bill. Further, progressive ballot initiatives fared far better than Democrats, with voters around the country enshrining abortion protections, raising the minimum wage, providing paid time to care for family, and strengthening the right to join in union. Even in Florida, where the abortion amendment failed to clear the necessary 60 percent, 14 percent more Floridians voted yes on it than voted for Harris. Provided voters still have some semblance of voice in who governs in two and four years -- a proposition not to be assumed given current mass voter purges, social media powered lies, let alone promises of far more draconian anti-democratic measures to come -- the overall pattern of elections suggests that Republicans are in for a repudiation. But until Democrats show, not tell, they are fighting for everyday people's lives and livelihoods and against billionaires, corporations, and MAGA Republicans hell bent on harming them, they cannot hope to fend off the twin lures of authoritarianism -- rooted in the siren song of blaming some \"other\" -- and cynicism -- rooted in the assessment that \"both sides\" are beholden to the money and not the many. In other words, \"it's neoliberalism, stupid.\" Anat Shenker-Osorio is a political strategist and communications researcher for progressive campaigns.\n"

      "Picture this. You risk everything for your country. Leave friends and family behind. Go overseas. Watch your friends die or have their lives changed forever. You come home. Adjusting isn't easy. The nightmares keep you up. That old military injury never really heals. You work full-time, go to school, scrape by just to make it. Then one day, you get the email. \"Congratulations, we are offering you a tentative job at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,\" or at the Department of Defense, or the USAID, or another agency. Finally, after years of sacrifice, you have a fresh start. You buy a home, get married, have kids, maybe even travel. Ten years go by. You've built a life. You have a steady career, glowing performance evaluations, and now a family and a mortgage. You did it. Your service paid off. You're finally living the American Dream. Then a promotion opportunity comes along. Just the raise you need to book that dream vacation with your family. The only catch? A short probationary period. No big deal. You've had a stellar record in federal service and the military. You take the job. Then Elon Musk , an unelected billionaire with no ties to the military, fires you. Everything you built, gone in an instant, at the whim of someone who has nothing to do with your service, your sacrifice, or your career. On the eve of this Valentine's Day, that is the brutal blow Trump and Musk have dealt to America's veterans. The administration this week began aggressively laying off thousands of government employees across multiple agencies, hitting veterans hard. The Department of Veterans Affairs confirmed late Thursday night that it has let go of more than 1,000 probationary employees this week. The U.S. Forest Service, meanwhile, is dismissing 3,400 employees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has fired probationary workers, as well as full-time contract employees. Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the General Services Administration (GSA), where termination letters have gone out to hundreds of recent hires. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has been actively coordinating these layoffs across federal agencies, with all probationary staff at OPM itself dismissed in a group call. Musk's team has also reportedly arrived at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), fueling fears of deep cuts. This sweeping downsizing is part of Musk's \"cost-cutting initiative,\" the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), which has already gained access to sensitive personnel and financial data in at least 16 agencies. Some agencies, like USAID, have been gutted completely. In all, DOGE is targeting over 200,000 federal employees for dismissal. Trump's administration has launched a full-scale attack on veterans, their families, and federal workers who support them. A third of all federal employees are military veterans, and make no mistake, the latest round of layoffs at the Department of Veterans Affairs is just the beginning. Trump's executive order, \"Implementing the President's Department of Government Efficiency Workforce Optimization Initiative,\" imposes one of the most damaging federal workforce policies in history. For every four employees who leave, only one can be replaced. For an already understaffed VA, this is a disaster. Veterans' medical care, disability claims, and support services depend on an adequate workforce. Slashing hiring ensures growing backlogs, worsening care, and increased suffering for those who rely on VA services. With an aging veteran population and an expanded VA mission under previous administrations, now is the time to invest in the VA, not gut it. Trump's executive order doesn't just stop at limiting new hires ; it also forces immediate reductions in force, cutting positions that aren't explicitly mandated by law. This means administrative staff, veteran outreach programs, and transition assistance services will be among the first to go. These programs provide critical support for transitioning service members, veterans seeking jobs, and military families overseas. Many depend on these programs for child care, job placement, and legal guidance -- services that help make the transition from military to civilian life possible. Now, veterans and their families are being left to fend for themselves. To make matters worse, the hiring process at the VA is now controlled by Musk's DOGE \"team leads,\" who have final approval over new employees. Instead of a merit-based system, hiring decisions are now subject to unnecessary delays and potential political interference. Some of these so-called team leads do not appear to have any government experience, and are instead young political operatives with extremist and racist views. The DOGE website seems to have porous security at best, raising concerns about the pseudo government agency having access to veterans' data. The VA is already grappling with a severe workforce shortage in medical and benefits processing roles. This new bureaucratic bottleneck ensures hiring will stall completely, leaving veterans without the services they need. But that may be the point -- by making the VA so dysfunctional, veterans will either suffer in silence or be forced into the private sector, where profits come before care. The administration claims it's \"saving money,\" yet no one can point to a real number. Meanwhile, the State Department nearly spent $400 million on \"armored Teslas\" for government use -- until public scrutiny forced them to back out. Still, Musk's companies continue raking in tens of billions in government subsidies. Trump and Musk exploit federal resources to enrich themselves, while the administration is scrambling to fund the president's mass deportation plans and extend the 2017 tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the ultra-wealthy. And who's paying the price? Veterans, federal employees, and military families. This Valentine's Day, many military veterans won't be celebrating with their families. Instead, they'll be struggling to pay their mortgages, car payments, and child care costs. Despite their service, many will never receive the rewards they've earned in federal employment, often qualifying only for entry-level positions because military jobs don't always translate directly to the civilian sector. Meanwhile, Musk and Trump -- two of the world's wealthiest and most powerful men -- have crushed veterans like ants under a sledgehammer. Regardless of the reasons, the damage is undeniable.\n",

      "Early in the 2016 campaign, months before Donald Trump won his first presidential nomination, I wrote my friend Philip Roth an email about his novel, The Plot Against America , which had appeared twelve years earlier. The book was Roth's fanciful but chilling fiction about a fascist takeover of the presidency in 1940 by the pilot and American hero Charles A. Lindbergh. I was curious about the possible connection between the novel and Trump's all too factual political emergence. Over the years, several pundits had claimed that Plot was really Roth's roman-a-clef commentary on the George W. Bush administration. Having myself written critically of Bush (including a piece here in Rolling Stone in 2006 asking if he was the worst U.S. president in history), and having talked politics often with Roth, I knew that he agreed with me that Bush, with all of his flaws, was no fascist or fascist sympathizer, as Lindbergh was. Roth went on to say as much, repeatedly, in interviews and public appearances. But what did he make of Trump? When Trump won in 2016, some commentators once again perceived similarities to The Plot Against America , not least because Trump had borrowed his chief isolationist slogan from the name of Lindbergh's movement, America First. Roth again demurred at any parallels, but in a different way. Trump's actual election, he told his good friend Judith Thurman of The New Yorker , was far more difficult to comprehend than Lindbergh's fictional election. Lindbergh, after all, was \"a great aviation hero,\" a man of substantial achievement and knowledge despite his Nazi sympathies. \"Trump,\" he said, \"is just a con artist.\" I knew that Roth also sensed that Trump the con man could become a genuine threat to American democracy, roughly along the lines described in his last major novel. In our email exchange, while the Republican primaries were just getting going, I expressed my apprehension about Trump and ribbed Philip about how maybe Plot really was non-fiction after all, \"and that you, pal, are clairvoyant.\" A day later came his reply: \"Yes, it does begin to look as if Trump, if elected, wouldn't have a qualm in a tight spot, about suspending the Constitution.\" Roth died early in 2018 and was blessedly spared watching Trump, the right-wing kleptocrat, try and overturn an election and turn into the clear and present danger he is now. I am confident, though, that, were he alive, Roth would recognize and acknowledge how so many of his novel's themes have frighteningly come to life. One of the most important of those themes concerns different characters who become either accomplices of or apologists for the maximum leader. They are not necessarily true believers, although some can sound that way. They are instead honored and even once-honorable people who voluntarily, indeed, actively make their peace with the fascist seizure of power. All of them are driven to abandon their country's founding principles and subdue their religious faith by some combination of ambition, fear, and confusion, drives and reflexes that the fascist operators thoroughly understand. It is these all too ordinary characters' collaboration that drives much of the book's narrative, as the protagonists try to twist America First into something noble that will benefit the Jews while, more generally, they try to normalize Lindbergh's pro- fascism as an authentic and admirable expression of the American way. There is the Conservative Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf, who mouths the Lindbergh line, who says America's Jews owe their allegiance to America above all and not to the European Jews who desperately need their help. Bengelsdorf even takes an official position in a government program designed to break up and relocate Jewish communities. Although he is convincing enough in his entreaties, it is never entirely clear how much the rabbi actually believes what he is spouting or is simply drawn to power. Then there is Bengelsdorf's wife, Evelyn (an aunt of the pre-teen boy named Philip Roth, whose older self is telling the story), desperate for affection, who brings the fascist propaganda line into the Roth family circle. Evelyn is even more attracted to authority and security than her husband, and voices disdain for Jews who are \"afraid of their own shadow\" and who supposedly have nothing to worry about from America First. Philip's older brother Sandy, in part under Evelyn's influence, spends a summer in a Lindbergh administration ethnic assimilation program in Kentucky, and returns a thorough convert, speaking in a country accent. And there are national political figures as well in the novel, notably the real-life Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, a one-time New Deal populist who drifts rightward, denounces Democrats who are hostile to Adolf Hitler as \"the war party,\" serves as Lindbergh's vice president, and tries to establish his own totalitarian regime when Lindbergh mysteriously disappears in 1942. The specific political situation of the 1930s and 1940s is obviously different from today's, although there are analogies. The America First movement had an affinity for Hitler, for example, as a function of its isolationism, not completely unlike the current America First/MAGA affinity for Vladimir Putin, with Trump and his loyalists reciting Russian talking points over Putin's aggression against Ukraine. But the collaboration of prominent Americans with Trump's attempted seizure of power involves the same sort of quiet, uncoerced moral collapse, born of fear-driven opportunism, that Roth's novel evokes. So does the collaboration of untold numbers of ordinary Americans, twenty-first century equivalents of the novel's Aunt Evelyn, Sandy Roth, and others. Today's moral collapse dates back decades, but began in earnest in 2016, when Republicans who seemed to know better, overcome by Trump's commandeering of the GOP's base during the party's primaries, turned into cringe-worthy sycophants. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas both ran for the Republican nomination that year; both had choice words for Trump. Graham famously called him a \"race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot,\" \"a kook,\" \"crazy,\" and \"unfit for office,\" and declared ruefully in retrospect that the GOP should have united to isolate him. Cruz called him a chronic liar and a \"sniveling coward,\" who was \"completely amoral,\" and he refused to endorse Trump at the 2016 Republican convention. (Cruz may have still been smarting from Trump's degrading references to \"Lyin' Ted's\" wife and his outrageous suggestions that Cruz's father had been mixed up in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.) Both Graham and Cruz have become staunch Trumpists. Graham and Cruz were but early examples of the abject surrender of what had been the Republican Party and its transformation into the MAGA Party. More recently, Senator Mitch McConnell has best emblemized GOP cravenness in the face of Trump's threats and humiliations. He notably denounced Trump as an insurrectionist in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, only to give him a free pass by blocking his removal from office -- which would have freed his party and the nation of any possibility of Trump's returning to the White House. The subsequent party excommunication of the handful of Republican public officials who dared stand up to Trump, above all former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, sealed the GOP's moral collapse. But the disgrace runs even deeper now that Trump's rolling coup d'etat is on the brink of seizing the power it needs to enact its reactionary, theocratic Project 2025. Senator Mitt Romney , for one, plainly finds Trump an abomination who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Yet in the crunch, Romney is refusing to join Cheney and Kinzinger (and Cheney's father, the deeply conservative former Vice President Dick Cheney) in supporting Kamala Harris . Romney has proffered the lame excuse that backing a Democrat might hinder the effort to repair the Republican Party -- as if there is any Republican Party left to repair, and as if anything but a Harris victory can stave off what Trump and his associates have vowed they will do to install authoritarian rule. Romney is not alone. James Baker, George H.W. Bush's closest political associate (as well as his secretary of state and chief of staff) -- and, at 94, one of the last remaining pillars of an older GOP -- was at least honest enough to admit in 2020 that, whatever else could be said about Trump, he would deliver on conservative judicial appointments, tax cuts for the wealthy, and deregulation, and was thus worthy of his vote. What, though, of the other establishment Republicans now reviled by the MAGA forces as RINOs? What of George W. Bush? What of his brother Jeb, ridiculed by Trump in 2016 as \"Low Energy Jeb\"? Neither has publicly supported Trump, yet neither will publicly support Harris. Evidently, they share with Romney the self-justifying fantasy that not voting for Harris will lead to a rebuilt post-Trump Republican Party. Most recently, outside the Republican Party, has come the even more alarming capitulation of Jeff Bezos in killing The Washington Post editorial page's endorsement of Harris. Some critics have called it a quid pro quo for Trump's potential support of Bezos's multi-billion dollar space age project, Blue Origin, whose executives met with Trump hours after Bezos suppressed the Harris endorsement. (Bezos has denied any suggestion of horse trading with Trump.) But regardless of that possible deal, Bezos' clumsy but effective intervention has signaled another variation of moral collapse: the ability of the would-be maximum leader to bully the third-wealthiest man in the world into silence and corporate censorship. Bezos could be reasonably certain that Harris, if elected, would operate under the constraints under the rule of law in any dealings with his companies and pose no threat to him, whereas if the lawless Trump were elected and the Post had endorsed Harris, Blue Origin and who knows what other of Bezos' holdings might be in serious trouble. This is precisely how dictators like Putin and Viktor Orban operate, shutting down dissent by making press lords offers they can't refuse. Under Bezos, the Post had adopted a slogan, \"Democracy dies in darkness.\" Thanks to his self-serving interference, that slogan is now dead, and what might have been a journalistic institution of accountability has been plunged into chaos, a week before the election. There are of course prominent figures even more sinister with regard to Trump than the world's third-richest man -- chief among them the richest man of all, Trump's supreme supporter, the maniacal Elon Musk -- along with Musk's fellow high-tech reactionary libertarian \"broligarchs,\" like Trump's early bankroller and J.D. Vance's sugar daddy, Peter Thiel. But they are men who regard Trump not as a Great Leader, but as a patsy, a useful instrument in their quest to overthrow the American government and replace it with rule by Ubermenschen like themselves. Awful as these figures are, it is people supposedly far more reasonable, including millions of ordinary Americans as well as their political leaders, who are playing an even more damaging role in making Trump's victory possible. They are the men and women who understand Trump's menace, who might denounce him now and then, even in strong terms, yet who support him anyway or who refuse to oppose him by supporting his Democratic opponent, or who willingly back down and serve him out of fear that his retribution will hurt their bottom line. Beyond suspending the Constitution, of which the real-life Philip Roth thought Trump fully capable, these are the kinds of responses and abdications that allow strongmen to come to power, killing democracy's greatness by playing on people's smallness, exploiting their desire to sustain what power they have, for what security they can obtain, gaining from them willing apologetics and obedience and collaboration. The Plot Against America' s clairvoyance brilliantly captures the human folly that abets the political crises from which fascist possibilities grow. In the novel, the nation is miraculously delivered from the fascists. FDR returns! Confronted now with our own all too real plot against America, we cannot rely on miracles and deus ex machinas. All we have is ourselves and the few days left to us to vote and prevent a hostile takeover of American democracy.\n"

      "Every time I hear \"voting is your civic duty,\" I cringe. As a climate activist and Get-Out-The-Vote organizer, I can't help but feel our election system is disconnected from the reality of actual Americans. The platitudes traditional politics offer feel so oblivious to the constant political buffoonery people are expected to endure. Just look at the experience of being a young person in this country right now. Across the United States, we see books being banned, as if this fascist-hallmark was a hobby. Children are told to hide in corners during shooting drills as they prepare for yet another massacre. Our youth are being mined for data that is owned by corporations who are interested in exploiting privacy for financial gain. New college grads are saddled with debt as they head straight into a housing crisis, and women who are able to vote for the first time have fewer rights over their body than when they were born. Meanwhile, it doesn't take a climate expert like myself to tell you that the climate crisis is only getting worse. Wildfires in Hawaii, floods across the Midwest, and intensifying storms across the East coast are becoming so common-place that we are no longer surprised by their devastation. Despite numerous international agreements, we still see the United States' emissions rising, and according to our own government, it is doubling down as the world's largest fossil gas producer. The response to this reality has, more often than not, been a series of thoughts-and-prayers style platitudes that ignore the core problems themselves. Attacks on our democracy have been consistent. Dozens of states have passed restrictive voting laws since 2020. Our current system is set up to abandon the young voters we need to get to the polls. And yet, every time someone tells me, \"This is the most important election of our lifetime,\" for the hundredth vote in a row, I dart back with an eyeroll so deep I can see my brain. This not the time to offer washed-up buzzwords that overlook reality. This is a pivotal time for the future of our democracy and we need to inspire voters on the issues they care most about. For me, that issue is climate justice. It's why I am launching the Climate Movement for Democracy. Over the past few years, I have seen climate change go from being perceived as a hoax to becoming a mainstay policy point. The relentless organizing of the climate movement and demand from the public made climate justice a central pillar to the Biden-Harris administration and to this election. I would have never thought that a voice like mine would be welcomed into the halls of the White House, let alone given their platform to speak. Over the past few years, the Biden administration created the White House Office of Environmental Justice and passed nearly $400 billion dollars for climate, the largest investment in climate, ever. These efforts have been revolutionary and valiant, but I would be lying if I didn't acknowledge that they are still insufficient. Things have been far from perfect, but right now, we have a stark choice to make. We have two very different presidential candidates -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump -- offering very different visions for what the future of this country could look like. I want to live in a country where it no longer feels like our government is falling apart. I see a vision of a climate-just future, where green jobs are the norm and our entire infrastructure runs on clean energy. Communities that were once disenfranchised are empowered and we can make decisions with our own autonomy. Being a citizen of this democracy should not mean social instability. And yet, the right-wing policy goals outlined in Project 2025 are engineered to demolish our government's core infrastructure. The conservative policy and personnel program, designed to help Trump quickly enact his agenda as president, aims to place the entire federal bureaucracy under control of a single person. It's a fossil fuel lobbyist fever dream that shuts down clean energy funding and destabilizes essential regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. This unitary executive \"project\" is the worst possible outcome for our planet and will kneecap our country's ability to face the climate crisis. This contrast gets lost in the platitudes. Instead of banal rallying cries, we have to meet people where they are and focus on the issues they care most about. Eight million young people are aging into the voting process this election. Whether they are passionate about reproductive freedom, gun violence, or immigration, the best step forward is at the ballot box. On this National Voter Registration Day, I'm launching the Climate Movement for Democracy, a campaign aimed at mobilizing voters to the polls to address the climate crisis. I know how all-consuming this conversation can be, and how disconnected our government can feel. But I take solace in the fact that if we show up to the polls and mobilize our friends, we can fundamentally decide what the future of this country looks like. That's not a platitude, that's a fact.\n",

      "George Washington could tell a lie, Taft didn't get stuck in the bath, and Mary Lincoln never used Todd, her maiden name, after marriage. As a presidential historian, I love eviscerating falsehoods with an arsenal of contradictory evidence. I start by naming the false witness, identifying his motivations, methodically trace the lie's evolution through secondary sources and, finally, arguing a moral imperative to intervene. I always win the battle, but I'll never win the war. I'm at least a century late for that. I'm not sold on \"history is written by the victors,\" but I'm certain that presidential history is determined by first-responders like first president's biographer Parson Weems, who invented the Cherry Tree Story in order to cast Washington -- and by extension, the infant nation -- as fundamentally good. Today, that likely includes the many journalists who are covering Biden 's presidency, like Axios' Alex Thompson , who left Hunter Biden's trial shocked by what he'd learned about Biden's decision to run for president given that several of his children were struggling with various addictions. These highly subjective contemporaries experience the president they chronicle and, whether they realize it or not, carry the attendant baggage of the era. I've seen this happen over and over again to the dead, my specialty, but it's breathtaking to watch it develop in real-time. \"I think the entire narrative on Joe Biden is gonna change,\" MSNBC's Chuck Todd said on his podcast last week. \"Everything's always been about his ambition and his ambition comes first.\" And less believable comparisons are becoming ossified as well; according to the Washington Times, First Lady Jill Biden is \"inviting comparisons to first lady Edith Wilson.\" Since the debate, the media has seemingly shifted its focused off Trump, who they tacitly disapprove of, and monomaniacally painted a portrait of Biden as a power hungry, angry old man who, despite the electorate's concern and dissent within the party, is shuffling towards November -- when his loss will unleash a fresh hell. He's going down, they tell us, and he's taking the American Experiment with him. This is a stark departure from what I assumed Biden's biography would be dominated by -- he emerged from retirement to defeat Donald J. Trump, jumpstarted the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, and gave FDR a run for most progressive -- but all may not be lost. Endings, the late scientist Daniel Kahneman told us , create an overwhelming cognitive illusion. If the last two days of a great vacation were terrible, we'll likely remember the whole trip as a bust. If the next six months in office are, as it seems, Biden's final act, his exit strategy should take inspiration from George Washington. He was called the greatest man who ever lived by contemporaries -- including King George III -- for voluntarily giving up power twice. And that's what, in a time of monarchs and despots, overwhelmed the reality on the ground: He rightly suspected most of the bold-faced founders like Thomas Jefferson wrote anonymous essays criticizing him, and he died estranged from them. I think Biden's exit can bring him immortal glory, too, but he'll have to go big -- and then immediately go home. At this point, Biden's increasingly likely announcement that he won't run for reelection less than a month before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago isn't enough to save his legacy. He'll still be blamed for hindering the new candidate's ability to compete with Trump, arguably the most famous man in America. And there's nothing magnanimous about the delayed announcement, either. He's acquiescing to pressure from the media, the electorate, and his party. But the key to overtaking that narrative is close at hand -- and a heartbeat away from the presidency. Sounds unfair? King George III, who is misremembered for losing America, would agree. The founders loved the king until he ignored their pleas, so in our collective memory, he's to blame. Still. No one seems to care that he was, by deferring to Parliament, following the British constitution. And no one will care, if Biden's replacement loses, that he stepped aside. He may be damned to the bottom half of the C-SPAN rankings for eternity, dismissed as the president who lost America. There's only one move left: Biden must resign. By doing so, his name would always appear alongside that of the woman president's ascension to the highest office. Gerald Ford predicted America's first woman President would ascend from the Vice Presidency, and though it's not ideal, given the present circumstances, it feels necessary. It's hard to imagine, with no rising star in the party, the Democrats bypassing Kamala Harris as their nominee. And strategically, it's the only way to guarantee the country becomes better acquainted with her through inevitable media focus on the historic nature of her candidacy. She can easily be cast as the comparatively youthful, optimistic foil to Trump, a doom-and-gloom senior citizen. But they can go even farther. Biden can save face by claiming it was the attempted assassination of Donald J. Trump that pushed him toward this decision. Just as Ronald Reagan was transformed by his own assassination attempt (he wrote an op-ed calling for greater gun control in the New York Times and pushed the Brady bill), he's been working toward bold legislation. Last fall, he created the first ever first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention -- and put Vice President Harris in charge. President Harris can reinforce this, and demonstrate her bipartisan approach to governing, by immediately calling for Congress to introduce the \"Donald J. Trump Gun Violence Prevention Act.\" She hopes, of course, that Republicans will support in light of the attempted assassination of the de facto leader of their party, but if not, that's fine. Her administration, like her predecessor's, puts country over party. And just like that, Biden's age becomes a chapter in the book of his life that ends on an unprecedented note: He not only stepped aside, but stepped down -- and that will always be the story of the first woman president. Of course, Biden has always been an unparalleled, selfless ally: He served as Vice President and loyal friend to Barack Obama, the first Black president. In 2026, when America celebrates its 250th anniversary, he'll be the only white male president of 45 who can make that claim. Alexis Coe is an American presidential historian, senior fellow at New America, and the author of, most recently, the New York Times best-selling You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington .\n"

      "Sandwiched in between an assassination attempt and a VP pick, District Judge Aileen Cannon issued one of the worst, most nakedly political judicial decisions in decades, dismissing the classified documents case against Donald Trump in a flat rejection of decades of precedent. Cannon's decision is a sneak preview of what's at stake in November: dozens of Trump-appointed federal judges who place nationalist politics above law, precedent, or even honor. The classified documents case should have been a slam dunk. We all saw the photos of boxes of top secret documents in Donald Trump's bathroom. Those documents, as everyone knows, are the property of the National Archives - and Trump surely knew it too, which is why he had them stashed away. There is no conceivable rationale for his making off with them, which is why Trump was charged with 31 counts under the Espionage Act. If this case had been before any honest judge in America, it would have been decided by now. But, by chance, the case was assigned to Cannon. (There are 18 district judges in the Southern District of Florida; the judge for any particular case is picked at random.) Twice, in fact. First, in August 2022, she was assigned to the civil case in which Trump sued the government for seizing the documents from Mar-a-Lago. The next month, she appointed a \"Special Master\" to vet the 11,000 records, shocking legal experts and interfering in the still-pending criminal investigation into Trump's actions. That act, which was rendered in a contorted and frankly bizarre opinion, was overturned in sharp terms by the (conservative-dominated) circuit court. Then, in June 2023, she was assigned to the criminal case she had previously interfered with. You can't make this stuff up. A protege of right-wing operator Leonard Leo , Trump appointed Cannon to the court in 2020; she was confirmed after Trump had already lost the election. Cannon was young, new, and inexperienced, and after she was chosen to oversee the classified documents case, some of her fellow judges suggested she step aside , given the enormity of the case and the impropriety of her previous involvement. But she stuck to it, and proceeded to delay it every step of the way. Though a trial was originally set for May, Cannon immediately began delaying the case using every procedural pretext in the book. Her clerks said she was at once overly anxious and overly demanding, leading one to turn down an offer and another to quit. And now, Cannon has dismissed the criminal case outright because of a legal theory that has been explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court as recently as five years ago: that the entire office of the special counsel - currently occupied by Jack Smith, who brought the case - is unconstitutional. This theory is a play-thing of the far right. Justice Clarence Thomas mentioned it, out of nowhere, in his concurring opinion in the Supreme Court's presidential immunity case . Federalist Society speakers talk about it often. And Judge Cannon requested a briefing on the question back in February. There's only one problem: It flies in the face of Supreme Court precedents from 1974 (Watergate), 1987 (Iran Contra), and 2019 (Russiagate). \"This is a very aggressive move on her part,\" Yale Law School professor Akhil R. Amar told The New York Times . Judge Cannon did attempt to distinguish away those precedents. For example, of the 1974 statement holding the independent counsel office constitutional, she said it was merely a \"dictum,\" i.e. a thing that a judge says in an opinion that is not an essential part of the precedent. Then again, the Supreme Court had already ruled on that point, holding in 2019 that \"the Supreme Court's quoted statement regarding the attorney general's power to appoint subordinate officers is, therefore, not dictum.\" In other words, the constitutionality of the independent counsel, and special counsel, is settled law. Which Judge Cannon threw out the window. If Trump loses the election, Cannon's decision will almost surely be overturned, and he may, one day, face trial for stealing boxes of classified documents after losing the 2020 election. But if Trump wins the election, his Department of Justice will surely drop the charges against him, and he'll get off scot free. More importantly, he'll get the chance to appoint dozens of judges just like Aileen Cannon: MAGA ideologues who believe they have to \"save America\" by doing whatever benefits the movement. Now, there is a word for systems like this, where the judiciary is merely an arm of the nationalist movement in power. It's a misunderstood word, and maybe an inflammatory word, especially coming on the heels of an attempted assassination of the nationalist candidate. Maybe we shouldn't use the word. But the word is \"fascism.\" As Thomas Zimmer has persuasively written in the context of Project 2025, fascism doesn't require concentration camps or jackbooted armed forces marching in unison. At its core, it's simply a political system where a nationalistic, anti-liberal party controls all the parts of government and society, including the courts, the press, the educational system, and the military - and uses them to cement its own power. The word comes from the fasces , a tied up bundle of sticks that signified the power of Ancient Rome: all the strands of society united in the service of the nation. Fascism is also a cult of personality, a style of romantic symbolism, a glorification of violence (and guns), an alchemy of rage and alienation into power and vengeance. All of these are present in the MAGA movement (Jeff Sharlet has written brilliantly on this), headed by a figure who many believe to be destined for leadership by God (and, most recently, saved from an assassin's bullet by divine intervention). I have no idea if Aileen Cannon believes any of this. But her rulings, consistently, have placed the \"stick\" of judicial power into Trump's nationalistic bundle. And they are impactful; Unlike the Stormy Daniels case, the documents case was squarely about Trump's acts in the wake of the 2020 election. And now it is gone. But I see this decision in the context of the future, not the past. People may support Trump for many reasons, but they should know that their vote will bring about a radical, nationalistic vision in which some people - a numerical minority of Americans - seize all the reins of power and use it to shape America in their image. If you like that image, and don't mind women, immigrants, DEI activists, and queer people having their rights taken away in order to achieve it, well, good for you. But if you don't, there's no denying that that is what this campaign has promised to do. Judge Aileen Cannon is a cog in that machine. If Trump wins, there will soon be thousands of her.\n",

      "President Joe Biden 's pardon for Hunter , his sole surviving son, was a symphony missing a crucial note: \"I changed my mind.\" The pardon was a moment of paternal grace that took me aback -- not because of the act itself but rather what was left unsaid. Presidential history boasts far more contentious pardons: George H. W. Bush pardoned former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and five others for secretly selling arms to Iran during an embargo. Bill Clinton pardoned disgraced financier Marc Rich. Donald Trump pardoned political allies who might be called to testify against him. The framers didn't envision the pardon as a familial bailout, but recent precedents exist: Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger, and Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father, after they had served time. The real surprise was Biden, nearing the twilight of his political career and facing a brutal reframing of his legacy, missing a clear opportunity to tackle the inevitable scrutiny head-on. \"He answered it very clearly, very forthright,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assured the media repeatedly, echoing Biden's promise not to pardon Hunter. As Biden reversed this position, headlines readily seized upon the contradictions: \"Six times Karine Jean-Pierre said President Biden wouldn't pardon his son Hunter,\" Fox News sneered, adding that the White House press secretary \"came away with egg on her face.\" Just one of the New York Post 's stories on it: \"All the times Joe Biden and the White House said he wouldn't pardon Hunter.\" And at Vanity Fair : \"Joe Biden's Pardon Is a Stunning Act of Hypocrisy.\" An explicit acknowledgment of his about-face might have altered the narrative, shifting focus from predictable critiques to a bold display of transparency. Instead, he echoed criticisms commonly leveled by Trump against the Justice Department during Biden's tenure -- and revealed what he really thought about a case he had remained relatively silent about. Presidents have historically revised stances, often conveyed with dignity, as Barack Obama exemplified when he transitioned from opposing to supporting same-sex marriage in 2012 -- a position maintained through campaigning. \"It's no secret the President has gone through some soul-searching on this issue,\" noted the White House, revealing introspective dialogues with people who swayed his thinking: the first lady; staff members; daughters Sasha and Malia, who have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. \"A few months ago, I told the Americans I did not trade arms for hostages,\" Ronald Reagan said in a speech from the Oval Office during the Iran-Contra scandal, taking full responsibility. \"My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tells me it's not.\" These declarations were examples Biden might have emulated. Biden could have avoided inadvertently endorsing Trump's critiques of the Justice Department by revealing what may have been the final straw: the eve prior, president-elect Trump announced plans for Kash Patel to lead the FBI amid rhetoric targeting both political and media circles. \"We will go out and find the conspirators,\" Patel proclaimed on Steve Bannon's podcast, intimating a sweeping agenda of retaliatory justice. \"Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out. But, yeah, we're putting you all on notice.\" Biden could have reminded Americans that in a normal partisan environment, matters involving first sons like Neil Bush , son of H. W. Bush, are often settled out of court. He could have noted a blanket pardon was necessary -- even Richard Nixon's amnesty offered a shorter period -- because in this charged environment, the so-called \"Biden crime family\" appeared especially exposed, adding layered complexity to Biden's consequential move the very next day. This context, apparently glaring to many on platforms like X and Bluesky, may not be so apparent to the broader public. As a presidential historian, this latest addition by Biden only adds to the cynicism I'm often subjected to. Hunter's pardon doesn't define Biden's presidency, but it reshapes the story of the integrity he aspired to restore. Its complexities aren't obvious amid today's scrutiny, and given his delivery, may never be. Alexis Coe is an American presidential historian, senior fellow at New America, and the author of, most recently, the New York Times bestselling You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington .\n"

      "On Thursday, in their ruling halting the Biden administration's plan to limit ozone pollution from drifting into other states, Supreme Court justices repeatedly, accidentally referenced \"nitrous oxide\" -- a.k.a. laughing gas -- rather than the chemical compounds actually at issue in the case. The opinion, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch , was published online for several hours before the errors were corrected . The next day, the Supreme Court overturned a bedrock administrative law principle, \"Chevron deference,\" that has long empowered federal agencies to interpret and implement statutes -- with the understanding that federal courts would defer to those agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous laws. Now, judges will get to fill in any policy gaps left by Congress: They are the real experts, the court has ruled. The decisions, taken together, offer a perfect representation of the current Supreme Court: Our country is being led by an all-powerful, undemocratic institution that is, in many ways, a complete joke -- in addition to being simply corrupt. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent on Friday, \"The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power\" -- and the justices are \"making a laughing-stock\" of long-standing judicial principles. Americans, broadly-speaking, appear to recognize the court isn't simply calling balls and strikes, as Chief Justice John Roberts once pledged to do. A survey published by the Associated Press on Thursday found that 70 percent of Americans believe that Supreme Court justices are more likely to try to shape the law to fit their own ideologies, while only 28 percent expect the court to be fair and impartial. Even a majority of Republicans, whose party controls the Supreme Court, believe justices' decisions are being guided by their ideology. Many of the court's decisions this term -- and in recent years -- have had a distinct joke-like quality to them. There were the five accidental references to laughing gas, nitrous oxide -- instead of nitrogen oxides -- in the Ohio v. Environmental Protection Agency decision, which will ultimately lead more people to breathe in polluted air. There was the court's opinion overruling its landmark Chevron decision -- a key goal of the conservative legal movement in recent years, but not always; conservative Justice Clarence Thomas previously authored an opinion defending it, before changing his mind. There was the decision allowing Americans to once again add \"bump stocks\" to their semi-automatic rifles to allow them to fire more quickly, with justices finding that the accessories aren't covered by the longstanding federal ban on fully automatic weapons -- a potentially deadly joke, coming to a city or town near you. In one of the court's most quietly egregious decisions, justices ruled that it didn't violate federal corruption rules for a garbage truck company to deliver a $13,000 payment to an Indiana mayor who helped steer a government contract to the company. \"Is a $100 Dunkin' Donuts gift card for a trash collector wrongful?\" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the court's opinion. \"What about a $200 Nike gift card for a county commissioner who voted to fund new school athletic facilities? Could students take their college professor out to Chipotle for an end-of-term celebration?\" Put simply, these things are not like the other -- they never would have been covered under the corruption statute. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted in her dissent, the corruption statute \"was not designed to apply to teachers accepting fruit baskets, soccer coaches getting gift cards, or newspaper delivery guys who get a tip at Christmas.\" Justices haven't issued their ruling yet on former President Donald Trump 's claims to an expansive, perpetual immunity shield from prosecution. The court's decision to accept the case delayed Trump's federal election subversion trial, ensuring it likely won't take place before the election; justices dragged out their decision in the case so long that they extended the court's term into July for the first time in some years. The Supreme Court's increasingly ridiculous antics and overtly ideological impulses are part of a broader pattern. In recent years, the court has used specious cases to impose its ideological blueprint on America. Last year, the court issued a decision allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ customers in a case that was ultimately hypothetical. No such customers had ever apparently sought to hire the web designer at the center of the case. The court also last year struck down President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, even though the student loan servicer at the center of the case faced no potential financial harm at all. In a 2022 case, justices allowed public school officials to bring prayer back into public schools, using the case of a high school football coach who did not appear to want his job back. The Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, has become a laughing-stock. Unfortunately, the joke is on us, and it's not at all funny.\n",

      "Do not let anyone fool you or tell you anything different: The elites won the 2024 United States presidential election. For the past two years that this reporter has covered Donald Trump 's now-successful campaign to reconquer power and stay out of prison , there has been one line of dialogue from a decade-and-a-half-old movie that has pounded in my brain, unstoppably, right up until the moment I stood in the center of a West Palm Beach convention center, listening to a decrepit, openly racist game-show host feeling himself on election night. One look at Trump and his jolly band of propagandists, moneymen , and aspiring ethnic cleansers , it's difficult not to recall a line from the 2009 film In The Loop , by master satirist and filmmaker Armando Iannucci , formerly of HBO's Veep . Near the movie's climax, U.K. spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker (who is working frantically to start a new war in the Middle East) says to a senior U.S. government official -- a character modeled partly on former Trump adviser John Bolton -- \"You know, I've come across a lot of psychos, but none as fucking boring as you.\" Standing in the center of Trump's election night 2024 watch party thrown near the president-elect's Florida home, it was gratuitously apparent just how much the American elites and our ruling class are disproportionately populated by Trump's most shockingly boring psychos. Wealthy donors in immaculate attire and with too much time on their hands were there. Nativists who ran the federal government into the ground, and are on track to run it yet again, were there, too. Hollywood actors like Jon Voight, who just acted in a Francis Ford Coppola movie, and a blue-blazer-donning Kevin Sorbo were enjoying the electoral nightlife. The elites and the establishment honchos of the wealthiest country the world has ever known aren't just the ethnic whites who ride and breed horses for fun, and who would rather be tortured to death than be photographed dining at a chain restaurant. They have for decades, if not centuries, been a debauched, easily bored, overeducated, vicious, and lawless constellation of old and new money. This is a matter of historical record . There is no person alive today, not a single guy, who embodies that culture more than Donald John Trump, a rich kid who inherited a family business empire -- just like he inherited recovered economies that were destroyed on Republicans ' (and his) watch -- and a bored dilettante who bullshitted and partied his way through life, just as he did during the Covid-19 disaster that flourished during his presidency and ultimately killed more than a million souls in the United States. When you think of our nation's elites, it is a mistake to see in your mind's eye an image of Oprah endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris , or even liberal mega-donor George Soros. An image I'll forever think of instead is from the makeshift dance floor at the Trump campaign's 2024 election night bash, when Rolling Stone observed a well-groomed, middle-aged couple, with drinks in hand, rushing to the center of the room, so they could gyrate and cheer to the sounds of the Village People disco-era hit, \"Y.M.C.A.,\" blasting on the loudspeakers, as the large video screens projecting a montage of Trump awkwardly jiggling to the song at his campaign's Beer-Hall-wannabe rallies. It is this reporter's previously stated position that if we are truly witnessing the gradual death of the great American empire, it should be noted the downfall was largely set to the tune of the \"Y.M.C.A.\" The man in the MAGA couple on Election Night seemed to agree on how oppressively lame that is, rolling his eyes visibly as his partner dragged him toward the crowd of bodies to dance. This is what the elites are. As Trump himself has admitted repeatedly in the past, he and his people are \"the super-elite,\" in part because \"we're richer, we're better-educated.\" And the true financial and moral constitution of the elites are typified nowadays by the incredibly boring, fantastically wealthy psychos of the Trump orbit -- ranging from Elon Musk , who spent at least $119 million on a pro-Trump Super PAC even though the president-elect thinks he's a \"boring\" weirdo ; the bosses of the crypto industry ; the billionaires who can't get enough of Trump; the Mitch McConnells of the universe; the literal Kennedy dynasty 's most visible heir ; and the overstimulated media titans who run the global Murdoch empire. \"They're not just boring, they're totally joyless. Not one of them radiates happiness with life,\" Iannucci messaged Rolling Stone in recent months, as he watched Trump's abrasively corny , morally vacant campaign and 2024 Republican National Convention unfold from afar. \"The more people are alerted to the tense balls of sadness and rage rattling behind their eyes, the better!\" Many millions of voters were alerted, and didn't care. Or they did care -- because they like Trump. But the political and industry elites of this nation were not -- as various interested parties or media personalities would have you believe -- punished or snubbed by Trump's latest election to the White House. The elites have been mightily rewarded for their class solidarity with the Trump family and his Republican Party. And on Election Day 2024, America's elites won a commanding victory to take back the country that has always been theirs. The fact that they did it when Trump managed to wrest control of the popular vote from Harris and the Democratic Party does not change the reality of what Trump's true support actually is, even today . But one reason that so many citizens, voters, and (of course) well-paid pundits refuse to define Trump or Musk as one with \"the elites\" is because so many of these people refuse to accept how barbaric and hideously empty-headed the elites of business, policymaking, and stardom have always been. There is a reason the more unhinged and personally destructive Kanye West got, the warmer his embrace by Trump and his media allies became. There is definitely a reason why the world's richest person has forged an enthusiastic and expensive alliance with Trump, loudly declaring that his happy life would implode if Harris won. And there is surely a reason why -- after Trump led a failed coup that left several people dead in early 2021 and horrified even some of his staunchest backers -- virtually the entirety of the GOP's upper crust, including the then-top Republican in the U.S. House, came crawling back to Trump within three tiny weeks of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and have stayed simpering at his side ever since. It's because Trump's fellow elites are just as depraved and craven as he is, and that bond could never truly rupture in the face of pro-Trump political violence, or any other fleeting disagreement between friends. And for the duration of his two-year campaign to get his old job back, Trump did what any famous elite is accustomed to chronically doing: He constantly obsessed over the dumbest shit imaginable and complained about other famous rich people, further underscoring that -- for all its pageantry, ideological literature, and superiority complexes -- fascism in all its forms has always been inescapably stupid. \" I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT ,\" the former and now future leader of the free world exclaimed on the internet in September, showing where his mind was at in the crucial final weeks of his presumably final presidential campaign. Trump's obsessions with marginalia and media and pop-cultural pettiness was often met with amusement, or at times disgust, by his Democratic opponent who was once, we suppose, on track to becoming the first female president of the United States. Throughout her truncated 2024 run, the vice president's staff would regularly have to brief her on the latest campaign news and developments -- and this would at times necessitate staffers scrupulously briefing her on Trump's latest bizarre outbursts or insult-riddled tangents about Harris. In August, right around the time of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the former president kept remarking on Harris' Time magazine cover, including while he was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania. During that rally speech, Trump declared to the world how much hotter he thinks he is than Harris. \" Time magazine doesn't have a picture of [Harris], they have this unbelievable artist drawing her and I said, 'Is that [Italian actress] Sophia Loren?' I couldn't tell,\" Trump told his audience. \"But I say that I am much better looking than\" the vice president, Trump added. \"I'm a better-looking person than Kamala.\" The multi-layered, ridiculous nature of Trump's sustained remarks was difficult to explain in a professional setting. In an in-person briefing right around the time Harris accepted the Democratic nomination in Chicago, she was made fully aware of Trump's fixation on her physical hotness or notness, according to a Harris adviser. But because of the peculiar, stream-of-consciousness word vomit of Trump's rally monologues, it was surprisingly hard for staff to explain to the vice president exactly what Trump meant, and the different layers of his live analysis of her, the Time magazine illustration, the now 90-year-old Italian actress, and Trump's own alleged sexiness. In this utterly surreal moment during the campaign, the Harris adviser says the vice president visibly shuddered, formed a weirded-out expression on her face, and tried in vain to make sense of what Trump was talking about. The adviser did not recall precisely what the vice president said, only that it was akin to \"ew\" and \"what the hell?\" But Trump's constant, petty obsessions are, whether we like to think of it this way or not, quintessentially emblematic of America's elites and the powerful few who rule over the rest of us. This is not a deviation. This is who they are.\n"

      "In one of the opening scenes of the award-winning movie There Will Be Blood , Daniel Day-Lewis' protagonist, Daniel Plainview, stands with his adopted son, little H.W., atop his shoulders, giving the movie's famous \"I'm an oil man\" speech. Plainview uses H.W. as a prop to soften his image, describing himself as a family man, running a family business, as he lobbies to win new contracts for lucrative oil leases out West at the dawn of the gusher age. The movie is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's Oil , a novel depicting the corruption and exploitation that characterized the American oil industry at that time. Sinclair drew his inspiration from the Teapot Dome scandal of the Warren G. Harding administration, a scandal some historians still deem the largest political corruption scandal in American history. Harding's Secretary of the Interior, Albert Bacon Fall, sold several Naval petroleum reserves, including those at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, to private oil companies without competitive bidding, in exchange for personal kickbacks, making Fall a very, very wealthy man. Data is the new oil. Swap in President Trump for Harding and Elon Musk and his young son X for Daniel and H.W., and this, my friends, is the Teapot Thunderdome. Anyone who still views Musk's project to be about improving government efficiency or modernizing government technology or eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse is not playing with a full deck. This is a land grab. Musk has seized nearly every major data repository in the federal government and may now access the Social Security numbers, employment records, banking information, and tax returns of the majority of Americans. If you are a veteran, use Medicare, or have applied for Social Security Disability Insurance, he may have a chunk of your medical history too. The value of this treasure trove of data is hard to calculate -- but given Musk's keen interest in amassing enough data to build an artificial intelligence empire with his AI platform, Grok, it is safe to assume he has a pretty good idea. It certainly exceeds the $300 million he spent to put Trump in office. It's not just your personal data he's after either. This is corporate espionage in broad daylight. Musk and his DOGE boys now have access to the business and technology ideas of America's best and brightest. They are thumbing through tens of millions of new business applications at the Small Business Administration in a terrifying game of Shark Tank in reverse. We can only assume the United States Patent and Trademark Office will be their next stop, if they are not there already. Musk has also ransacked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where he'll find detailed information on the future competitors of his new digital payment platform collaboration with Visa, X Money. Over at the Food and Drug Administration he'll find immensely valuable information from clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of medical devices, like those of the competitors to his new brain chip company, Neuralink. Meanwhile, Musk is after larger and more lucrative federal contracts for his companies, Starlink, Space X, and Tesla. The fruits of his labor are already bearing: The Federal Aviation Administration announced this week that they'll use Starlink to upgrade its IT systems. Further, he can axe the regulators tasked with keeping an eye on companies. To date, Musk has shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helped Trump fire labor law enforcers at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, both of which have investigated Musk's companies for illegal hostility and harassment of their workers. The Teapot Dome scandal was a wakeup call for policymakers, and they strengthened and passed a number of laws in its wake. Albert Fall became the first Cabinet secretary to go to prison. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the power to compel testimony and Congress strengthened the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, regulating campaign finance. Congress also gave the Ways and Means Committee the ability to obtain the tax records of any taxpayer, power they used to eventually secure the public release of Trump's tax returns. Toward the end of There Will Be Blood , Day-Lewis' Plainview lectures his rival, played by Paul Dano, on the cutthroat nature of the oil business. He explains that if they both have a milkshake, but Day-Lewis has a straw that reaches Dano's milkshake, \"I drink your milkshake,\" making a loud, exaggerated slurping sound. \"I drink it up,\" he concludes. Elon Musk is drinking America's milkshake. We must stop him before he drinks us dry.\n",

      "With just weeks to go in this election, we are on the brink of another transfer of power, with a near 50/50 chance that Donald Trump will again be preparing to govern. Ominous signs right now suggest Trump's plan for this transition is chaotic and risky, flouting rules established to keep the country safe and secure. What is most worrisome about the Trump planning, though, is the dangerous game of chicken he is playing with the outgoing Biden White House. We recently learned that the Trump transition team has not yet signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the General Services Administration or the White House, missing deadlines established to ensure careful planning and cooperation occurs before and after the election (the Harris-Walz transition team signed its MOU in mid-September). In theory, this means the Trump transition team -- should he win in November -- will not receive the assistance the government offers to major party candidates, including millions of dollars in federal assistance, free office space and information technology, and access to federal experts. Any transition team choosing to opt out of these services is at best foolish. At worst, it's risking the safety and security of the country, and depriving the president-elect of the information needed to effectively govern on day one. President Joe Biden , perhaps better than anyone, understands these risks. He's been through three presidential transitions: two as a part of the incoming administration and one as the outgoing. He was there in January 2009 when the Bush White House informed the incoming Obama administration of intelligence about a potential foreign terrorist attack on the inauguration. He also was there in the fall of 2016 to witness the incoming Trump administration ignore the offers of help from the Obama administration, and again four years later for his own transition. With days remaining before Biden was to be sworn into office, the team preparing for the inauguration faced a domestic crisis. Not only had the country just barely survived the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the outgoing Trump administration was still sowing disorder. An ad-hoc group made up of many of key figures about to go into the White House, including Lisa Monaco, Jake Sullivan, and soon-to-be Secretary of State Antony Blinken found out the sitting administration seemed to be ignoring what had just happened at the Capitol. Trump officials were still approving what one person on the transition team called \"crazy stuff,\" including permits to protest during the inauguration at the White House and around the Capitol grounds. The group immediately had extra fencing installed and arranged for the Washington Mall to be emptied out before Inauguration Day, precautions aimed to make sure a repeat of Jan. 6 didn't occur. Biden and his advisers surely remember these trying times and understand the value of careful planning and bipartisan cooperation, as well as the dangers for the country of going it alone. The Trump transition team knows this, and, I suspect, is betting on Biden overriding the transition rules and forgiving the missing MOU. While Biden's generosity might reassure those worried that an incoming Trump administration would be cut off from important intelligence about the threats to the country, such a situation would open a Pandora's Box of new threats. For one, allowing Trump's transition to operate without an MOU means it will not be bound by strict limits on fundraising. Donations to the Harris-Walz transition team, for example, are capped at $5,000 and the names of donors must be made public. No MOU means anyone seeking influence with an incoming Trump administration could give unlimited amounts to the transition team while at the same time lobbying the transition team on key appointments while making controversial policy demands. Even with the limits in place, the 2016 Trump transition raised $6.5 million from private donors, including the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge funders like Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, and Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus. WWE executive Linda McMahon gave the maximum amount in 2016 before being appointed administrator of the Small Business Administration. She's now overseeing the Trump transition team. Another Trump transition without those limits would likely break fundraising records, and the public wouldn't know a thing about who'd paid the bills. Equally worrisome is what this failure to sign the MOU says about the willingness of the Trump transition team to actually cooperate with the outgoing administration. Trump's disdain for the permanent officials running the government has only intensified since he left office, suggesting even if he was given an exemption from the transition rules, he still wouldn't turn to the Biden administration for help. This wouldn't be surprising for anyone involved in the last chaotic transition. For months after the 2020 election, there was just spotty cooperation between the incoming Biden transition and outgoing Trump administration. Some Trump officials met with the Biden-Harris team, sharing information about the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues faced by federal agencies. For others, they could barely be bothered to show up to a meeting, disregarding decades of bipartisan tradition that has ensured a seamless transfer of power. Much of the problem in each of the last three transitions that Trump has been a part of is the very Trumpian disregard for the institutions and people of government, especially around intelligence. And within Trump's inner circle, nobody is as distrusting as Kash Patel. It was Patel, installed as the acting chief of staff at the Department of Defense shortly after the 2020 election, who signaled that cooperation with the Biden-Harris transition team was forbidden. As I wrote about in my book on the 2020-21 transition (excerpted by Rolling Stone in June), many Trump defense and intelligence appointees listened to Patel's demand. One Trump intelligence official refused to share information at a face-to-face meeting with the Biden-Harris team, falsely claiming: \"You guys are not legitimate, so I'm not sharing this information.\" The consequence of this refusal is hard to quantify; no attacks on the country happened immediately after the Biden administration took over. Nevertheless, the person I interviewed explained that members of the transition team \"were unable to provide a complete picture of the current... intel threat environment,\" and then concluded, \"had there been something similar [to 9/11], we wouldn't have had the information.\" Just as Trump hasn't gone away, Patel is still around, too. The New York Times reported that he is under consideration for a spot on the National Security Council or possibly even the director of the CIA, should Trump win. All attention is rightly now on the campaign, but with Patel and other MAGA loyalists in the mix, the signs are becoming clear that some of the worst elements of past presidential transitions may occur again. A transition in 2024 marked by unchecked corporate influence, distrust of government officials, and little cooperation with the outgoing Biden administration puts the safety and security of the country at great risk. This game of chicken is one the country will badly lose.\n"

      "Polls are underestimating the importance of climate change to the average American. Every election cycle, pollsters hone in on core issues top of mind for the American public. These topics can make or break the American family as parents are getting kids ready for school in the morning and trying to figure out how to pay their bills at night. Traditionally, we call these \"kitchen table\" issues, and they encompass everything from the economy, to education, to housing, to health care. But this election season, our climate is driving decisions on where to live, how to consume, whether to rebuild, or even evacuate, for voters right now. What pollsters miss from their ranking of top issues is the fact that if we do not address climate change, every other major issue on the American mind will get worse. Economic and scientific models paint a challenging future. In the era of the climate crisis, costs skyrocket as harvests fail from droughts and extreme heat. Insurance premiums explode as flood and fire risks become guarantees. Real estate values plummet as beach-front properties become submerged by the very beaches they once adorned. As climate change worsens, we can expect human health to take a toll from increased spread of infectious diseases, worsening air quality, and declining mental health from climate anxiety. We see a particular environmental justice burden on women, youth, and people of color, too. The reality is that climate change is no longer a distant issue. We are living in the era of the climate crisis right now, and we are seeing alarming impacts across our nation. Fatal disasters like Hurricanes Helene and Milton have devastated the Southeast, with ocean warming exacerbating the severity of storms. Fire season continues to spread across the West, displacing thousands of Americans from their homes. At this point, none of this is novel, and Americans are constantly addressing these issues at home. These intersecting crises have taken a toll on national morale. Young voters are feeling particularly disillusioned as a spring Harvard Poll found that only 9 percent of young Americans felt the nation was generally headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, a July survey from Climate Power found that two-thirds of voters consider extreme weather a kitchen table issue in their household. As a leading progressive legislator and climate movement leader, we agree with that majority. Concepts of a plan are not enough when the American public is being berated with one climate disaster after the next. It is time to treat climate like the kitchen table issue it is, rather than confine it to the margins. In the pages of her most recent policy plans, Vice President Kamala Harris is doing just that. As Evergreen Action recently synthesized, Harris has begun to formalize the connections between housing, health care, economics, and climate policy that the American public and climate movement have been making for decades. For example, her new economic plan advocates for \"America Forward\" tax incentives that promote cleaner steel and cement, protecting jobs for American unions while simultaneously reorienting our industrial sector around decarbonization. Her housing policy would build 1.2 million units of affordable, energy-efficient homes, expanding American housing access while cutting back on energy consumption. Finally, her plan ties health care, child care, and education to our green future, affirming the fact that we can only raise safe, happy, healthy, children if we protect a planet that fosters those conditions. In each of these policies, Harris makes a bold step toward centering climate as a major issue this election cycle, as core to the American voter as the schools their children attend and the price of their grocery store haul. It might seem odd to see a congressman and an activist team up on an essay like this. In some ways, we're opposites. One of us is on the ground mobilizing a grassroots movement of voters around a systemic climate agenda. The other is a member of Congress representing Silicon Valley, working within the system to affect national change and drive clean tech innovation. But we are both fighting for bold action on inequality and climate. For both of us, the climate crisis is personal. Like Harris, we are both South Asian, and our communities are experiencing disproportionate environmental justice burdens as disasters unfold. We are unified in acknowledging that we can no longer hesitate on climate action. Together, we are pushing for top-down and bottom-up systemic change. And that starts with changing our national discourse so that it truly reflects the reality of everyday Americans. Climate justice frames every other issue on the ballot this fall. The tough decisions that climate change is forcing on American families are not an inevitability or an abstraction. They're real, they're ubiquitous, and they're actively unfolding. We need to start legislating -- and voting -- accordingly. In this election, one candidate has a history of fighting for climate justice. The other is deep in the pockets of the oil industry, selling out the American public for campaign contributions. Harris has made great strides on climate policy, and voters should keep pushing her to keep it front and center: right on the kitchen table, where it has already emerged.\n",

      "The world's richest man, Elon Musk , has an office in the White House and played a prominent role in Donald Trump 's inauguration. He has a formal position reshaping government in the new administration and has already derailed a bipartisan spending deal in Congress. Global leaders are taking Musk's meddling in European politics seriously, based on the perception or reality that he has influence over the new president. Musk's personal wealth ballooned by an estimated $170 billion in the month after Trump's election win, with investors betting that Musk's companies -- some of which are under federal investigation , and benefit from billions in federal contracts -- will receive favorable treatment from the new administration. It is hard to think of any modern parallel. And it is a direct result of the Supreme Court 's decision in Citizens United v. FEC , which turned 15 this week. Musk's astonishing influence over Trump and the Republican Party is not merely a function of his wealth, his celebrity, or his ownership of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). It is attributable to his pouring at least $277 million into Super PACs last year, which purchased enormous sway with the new administration. This hundreds of millions in political spending would have been impossible -- illegal -- before Citizens United opened the floodgates to unlimited money in politics . The 2010 decision struck down limits on supposedly \"independent\" political spending, opening the door to billionaire-funded Super PACs and leading to an explosion in untraceable dark money. Last year, roughly 44 percent of all money raised to support Trump came from just 10 donors, according to OpenSecrets , with most of that money going to the purportedly independent Super PACs made possible by Citizens United . Musk alone gave $239 million to his America PAC, which spent $153 million on the presidential race. The Supreme Court in Citizens United reasoned that such independent political spending cannot corrupt officeholders. That argument was highly dubious from the start, but the fiction of \"independence\" has almost completely vanished, thanks to a 2024 advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission allowing campaigns and Super PACs to coordinate on canvassing activities. That opinion allowed the Trump campaign to outsource key campaign operations to Musk's America PAC, amplifying the corruptive influence of Musk's spending, and further illustrating the folly of the Supreme Court's reasoning. Musk's ability to translate economic power into political power is a glaring example of how Citizens United changed politics. But it is hardly unique. The Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, embraced big donors from corporate America and allowed them to shape economic policy ; Harris never made money's influence on politics a central theme in her campaign. This was a contrast from the 2020 race, where candidates vying for the Democratic nomination promised to change the campaign finance system , and adopted a range of voluntary pledges to demonstrate their commitment to getting big money out of politics. In his farewell address, President Joe Biden warned of America moving toward an \"oligarchy\" of \"extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy.\" It was good to hear, but he did little during his term in office to limit money's influence on politics. In fact, it was the Biden-nominated Democratic FEC Commissioner who cast the deciding vote on the advisory opinion that paved the way for Trump to coordinate with Musk's America PAC, part of a broader deregulatory trend that occurred on Biden's watch. Musk's stunning political influence offers a stark example of how Citizens United enabled billionaires to wield disproportionate power over policy and governance. If this trajectory continues, the voices of everyday Americans will be further drowned out by the interests of a wealthy few. Without meaningful campaign finance reform -- and a Supreme Court that will uphold those reforms -- the erosion of our democracy will only accelerate. The American people must demand greater transparency, accountability, and a political system that serves the public interest, not just the interests of the ultra-wealthy.\n"

      "At this late hour, with so much at stake in this election, let's get one thing straight: Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the American economy, to women's reproductive freedom, and to democracy itself. But he is not a threat to the planet. Whatever happens on Nov. 5, Earth will be fine. During her 4.5 billion years spinning around the sun, our beautiful planet has been bombarded by meteors, cooked by volcanoes, and iced into a giant snowball. Earth doesn't care about Trump. To her, he is a flea that shits on a gold-gilt toilet. What's at stake in this election is something more fragile: the stable climate that is the basis for civilized life as we know it. Because your job, your freedom, and your future are all dependent on the kindness and generosity of the Earth's atmosphere. If we fuck that up, we're all in big trouble -- and so is every living thing around us. There is no democracy in a world ravaged by climate-driven war, disease, displacement, and economic mayhem. What happens on Nov. 5 will go a long way toward determining whether Phoenix will be a habitable city in the years to come, whether wildfires will consume the West, whether the ocean will become a dead pool of jellyfish and coastal cities like Miami and Charleston become underwater theme parks. Do you, my friend, want to spend the rest of your days spun around by climate chaos in all its forms? Water shortages, blackouts, crop failures, skyrocketing insurance rates, new pandemics, flooded cities and towns, heat deaths, Category Six hurricanes that turn million-dollar condos into wreckage in a few hours. That's the choice we have in this election. As Beyonce said at a recent rally for Kamala Harris in Houston, \"Our past, our present, our future merge to meet us here.\" FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, I've written about the climate crisis at R olling Stone and published seven books, including the New York Times bestseller The Heat Will Kill You First . I've seen glaciers collapsing in Greenland and Antarctica. I've seen the bodies of people who died from extreme heat. I've seen starving polar bears and talked with water-panicked farmers. I've looked through a microscope at a malaria-carrying mosquito. I've been a mile underground in a Pennsylvania coal mine and in the middle of the Atlantic in an ocean research vessel. I've dove down to coral reefs in Australia that are bleached out by hot, acidic ocean water, and I've hiked through forests in Colorado that are being eaten alive by pine bark beetles. I've talked to scientists, politicians, activists, emergency room doctors, urban planners, clean tech entrepreneurs, and climate doomers who think we are all cooked anyway, so who the hell cares. Here is what I've learned from all this: The climate crisis is real, it is happening fast, and we are not ready for what's coming. Not even close. We are driving our gas-guzzling SUVs into a shitstorm the likes of which no humans have ever witnessed before. I've also talked to people who see this whole thing very differently than I do. They show me junky graphs that argue the recent warming is just part of a natural cycle. Or they argue that China (or, sometimes, India, or just nameless Black/brown/yellow people in some distant land) are responsible for climate change . Or they believe the climate crisis is a scam cooked up by George Soros to steal your God-given right to burn fossil fuels. In their view, people like me, who talk bluntly about the risks of climate change, are all grifters who are trying to take away your hamburgers and your jacked-up Jeep and force you to eat bugs and ride an electric skateboard. They're wrong. But I've dealt with enough flat-Earthers to know that nothing I'm going to say here is going to change their minds. So right now, at this moment of decision, I just want to talk to people who are still tethered to reality and who are honestly trying to grapple with what's at stake in this election. Maybe you love Kamala. Maybe not. Maybe you're cynical about politics and think it doesn't really matter who is president. Maybe you don't want to vote for her because of the ongoing horrors in Gaza. Or maybe you wish that she didn't play footsie with frackers and was a fiercer advocate of the promise (and the inevitability) of the clean energy revolution. But we live in the world we have, not the world we wish for. And in this world, the job of making sure Donald Trump is not the next president of the United States could not be more urgent. There's no room here for a crash course on climate risk. But here's the news from just the past few weeks: NASA determined that 2024 was the hottest summer since modern recordkeeping began, and the hottest ten years have all been in the last decade. The UN called out \"a massive gap between rhetoric and reality\" in global action on the greenhouse gas pollution targets in the Paris climate agreement, and warned the world is now heading for as much as 3 C of warming, double the ambitious Paris goal. The 2024 Living Planet Report details \"a catastrophic 73 percent decline in the average wildlife populations over just 50 years.\" Science reported that global CO2 emissions from forest fires have increased by 60 percent since 2001. Forest fires have also shifted north and become more severe. An open letter from 44 climate scientists from 15 countries warned that the collapse of the main Atlantic Ocean circulation system, known as AMOC, has been \"greatly underestimated\" and would have devastating and irreversible impacts on the climate in the northern hemisphere. And the highly regarded 2024 State of the Planet report began with these ominous words: \"We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled.\" TRUMP THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE is a hoax. He makes jokes about sea-level rise creating more oceanfront real estate and how wind turbines kill birds and whales. He talks about solar and wind power like they are toys and warns us that if we get too dependent on them, we might not be able to watch TV if the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing -- which is, to Trump, a technological failure that steals life of meaning and purpose. Project 2025 , his 900-page policy wish list of actions he will take if he is elected, includes plans to dismantle NOAA, the federal agency that is responsible for climate science and weather data, as well as eliminate the National Flood Insurance Program, the only protection homeowners have against the increasingly devastating climate-driven flooding like Hurricane Helene delivered last month in North Carolina. And oh, there is so much more. Trump has repeatedly said he intends to be \"a dictator for one day,\" in part so he can \"drill, baby, drill.\" He invited oil and gas execs to Mar-a-Lago recently to pitch them a deal, which boiled down to something like this: Donate a billion dollars to my campaign, and when I'm elected, I'll give you whatever you want. But to call Trump a climate denier doesn't really capture what what's going on here. In fact, Trump is running a pro-climate chaos campaign. To him, a superheated planet is a feature, not a bug. Think about this way: The more chaotic our world becomes, the easier it is for him to stoke fear, build walls, deploy the military, and cosplay the Strong Man. He can play politics with disaster relief , giving federal money to his pals, or his constituencies. As for the people who die in heat waves or whose homes are washed away by bigger storms -- well, most of them aren't active voters, or if they are, they are likely to be Black or brown and so who the hell cares? For a vivid example of how this works, just look at Trump's pal, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed a bill prohibiting shade or water breaks for workers during the hottest summer ever recorded in Texas. The workers who die during heat waves in Texas are likely to be Mexican migrants (who -- let's be honest -- do most of the hard outdoor work in Texas). For Abbott, it was a way to look tough to his largely white supporters, with virtually no political downside. Trump loves fossil fuels not only because he's too stupid to grasp the promise of clean energy. He loves fossil fuels because the fossil fuel industry understands and embraces power in a way that is perfectly in sync with Trump's politics. The architecture of the fossil fuel industry is all about centralized control -- big power plants, big refineries, big pipelines. They are the pushers, we are the addicts. Renewables, on the other hand, are decentralized, democratic, and thrive on innovation, not political muscle. No wonder Trump hates them. SINCE SHE BEGAN her presidential campaign in July, Harris has not spoken forcefully about the risks of life on a super-heated planet. When pressed about it, she mentions that she cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which provided about $370 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below their 2005 levels by the end of this decade. But Harris has not said much about how she will build on the success of IRA if she wins. Nor does she talk much about the astounding fact that clean energy jobs grew at more than twice the rate of the overall economy in 2023. By the end of last year, there were over half a million jobs in wind, solar, and energy storage in the United States. That said, Harris's record on climate is strong. She has called climate change \"an existential threat.\" As California attorney general, she prosecuted oil companies for environmental violations. During her short-lived 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign, she released a $10 trillion climate plan that called for investing in renewable energy, holding polluters accountable, helping communities affected by climate change, and protecting natural resources. As vice president, she announced $1 billion in grants for states to address flooding and extreme heat exacerbated by climate change. \"The science is clear,\" she said . \"Extreme weather will only get worse, and the climate crisis will only accelerate.'' Why has she been so soft-spoken about it during the campaign? In a word, Pennsylvania. Clearly, Harris has made the calculation that talking too bluntly about climate risk or clean energy might imperil her standing with voters in that all-important swing state. But how how many voters are we talking about, really? Trump claims 500,000 workers in the state are employed by fracking, but that is (of course) bullshit. Sean O'Leary, a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, a think tank in Pennsylvania, calculates that only 18,636 jobs in the state can be directly attributed to fracking. If you count indirect jobs, the overall job figure would be about 55,000 -- about one-tenth of Trump's number. Clean energy, on the other hand, employs nearly 70,000 workers in the state and is growing 50 percent faster than the rest of Pennsylvania's economy. It's a tricky line for Harris to walk, to be sure. Especially considering the fact that Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by only 80,555 votes . But by speaking softly about the climate crisis and the promise of clean energy, Harris risks alienating young voters who understand very well the perils of life in a rapidly-warming world. \"One thing people always say is that youth voters don't turn out, but my answer is always it's not that they don't care, it's that they've never felt seen, or heard, or talked to,\" one young Democratic organizer in Florida told The Guardian . \"What's different now is because we are all youth talking to youth, we understand our generation, we know how to talk to them. You don't want an 80-year-old talking to a 20-year-old about climate change, or any issue. It just doesn't work. We're all 20-year-olds talking to 20-year-olds. We understand it, so it resonates.\" It sucks that we live in a country that's so polarized and so tweaked by disinformation that one of the biggest threats to civilized life on Earth has barely been discussed in this campaign. But in the end, that's on us, not Harris. The climate fight has always been a slow guerilla war in a malaria-infested swamp against an enemy with bigger guns and a lot more money. Americans have been silenced, lied to, and falsely comforted by people with a vested interest in denying the truth about what's happening in our world and to the future we imagine for ourselves and our kids. On Nov. 5, we have a chance to change that. A vote for Kamala Harris is not a vote to save the planet. But it is a vote to save ourselves.\n"

      "Donald Trump and Elon Musk 's so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) was created under the guise of eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse in federal spending. But, like many of Musk's grand pitches -- Hyperloops, Mars colonization, Tesla robots, robotaxis, self-driving cars -- DOGE is just another empty promise from one of the world's most practiced conmen. In its supposed \"savings\" report, DOGE claimed to have saved $55 billion -- a small portion of of which came from capping payments for research grants . The rest? There aren't any real savings. All DOGE did was cancel government contracts. That's like deciding to stop paying your bills and mortgage to cover your credit card debt, only to realize your so-called \"savings\" won't even cover a single interest payment. A common theme in the DOGE data is the cancellation of subscription-based services that federal congressional and public affairs offices rely on, such as newspapers with paywalls, Beltway tipsheets, and telephone and email directory systems. This move will only make the government less efficient and force those in these roles to spend more time tracking down news and contact information essential to their work. These contracts were all approved by the agencies with money allocated by Congress, who seems to have conceded more of their authority to Musk every day. Worse, many of the canceled contracts were awarded to disabled and veteran-owned small businesses. Musk and Trump seem to have a particular knack for shortchanging veterans -- even those who don't rely on care from the Department of Veterans Affairs or work for the federal government. One contract, valued at $3.8 million , provided training for federal agencies. It was awarded to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Minority-Owned Business Enterprise specializing in organizational and management consulting. The contract, according to federal records, was for \"DEIA program and project management support services\" -- a sin in Washington amid Trump's all-out war on diversity programs. The company, founded in 2008 by Marine Corps veteran Chris Gonzalez, now faces uncertainty due to these cuts. Another contract, valued at $5.7 million, was arbitrarily canceled by DOGE and belonged to MIRACORP, INC., an all-woman, disabled veteran-owned business based in Mesa, Arizona. The company provides project management assistance for federal agencies -- in this case, for the Green Proving Ground program, which reportedly helped the government save $28 million on energy costs each year. By ending this contract on a program that helped cut costs, you are supposed to believe the fiction that the government is actually saving money. These so-called DOGE \"savings\" do add up -- at the expense of veterans. The largest group affected by DOGE's cuts at the VA has naturally been veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. It should come as no that, amid DOGE's mass purge at the Federal Aviation Authority , Musk has offered the services of his SpaceX company to the FAA to \"help make air travel safer.\" With DOGE currently preparing to raid the Pentagon , we can expect even more veteran- and disabled veteran-owned businesses, along with government contractors that compete with Musk's companies, to be cut. The Department of Defense is also one of the largest employers of veterans in the nation. DOGE firings are expected to start Wednesday. If DOGE does \"audits,\" like they did at USDA or the National Nuclear Security Agency , we can expect more chaos. As part of its \"savings,\" DOGE also canceled federal real estate contracts , including a $27,000 annual lease in a property in Las Cruces, New Mexico, that houses the Las Cruces Vet Center. Vet Centers are vital components of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, established after the Vietnam War to provide veterans with a space outside traditional government facilities, helping them avoid the stigma associated with federal institutions at the time. These centers provide life-saving counseling services for veterans and their families -- I have personally witnessed their staff intervene to prevent veteran suicide attempts. The DOGE site claims this Vet Center will be relocated to a federal building, with the nearest major facility being over three hours away in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Vet Center will still pay rent -- the funds will now go to the U.S. General Services Administration instead of a private landlord, redirecting money away from the local economy of Las Cruces. The result? A grand total of $0 in taxpayer savings. With little understanding of how the federal government operates, DOGE's actions are only setting the stage for further harm, as they arbitrarily close additional facilities -- and especially as they gain access to the largest federal funding source, the Pentagon. In claiming it's produced billions in savings, DOGE has taken credit for canceling contracts that were already mostly paid -- exaggerating savings by counting unobligated funds as if they were guaranteed future expenses. In some cases, it has inflated savings numbers by orders of magnitude, pretending an $8 million contract was actually $8 billion, and failing to fix its error when social media users flagged the discrepancy. This isn't fiscal responsibility; it's an accounting gimmick designed to make the numbers sound good while veterans pay the price.. DOGE has uncovered no real waste or abuse -- only contracts it could cancel to create the illusion of savings. The real cost falls on the veterans who rely on these services, the contracts that support them, and the businesses that employ them.\n",

      "In the wake of the election, some have said that Democrats need to talk less about transgender people. That's exactly wrong: they, and we, need to talk more -- more about real trans lives, real science, and real values, and less about disinformation and lies. Thanks to nearly $250 billion in campaign spending , Republicans have owned the discourse about trans people and have, in Steve Bannon's memorable phrase, \"flooded the zone with shit.\" They have spread lies about trans identity, trans sports, and trans kids. They have Swift-Boated the Democrats, who were afraid to fight back and lost votes and credibility as a result. And while that disinformation blitz didn't determine the outcome of the election -- the economy did -- it raised the intensity of anti-trans sentiment, to the point where the basic science and lives of trans people is now being denied. I got a small taste of that myself, when, on CNN last week, I objected to a fellow journalist describing trans girls as \"boys playing girls' sports.\" In response, I've received thousands of hateful text messages, emails, and social media messages, which comes with the territory, but I've also been excoriated on Fox News, in the Atlantic, and elsewhere, which often repeated the same medically-inaccurate, historically-inaccurate right-wing talking points. We need to take a breath and press the reset button. Let's start with the definitions of sex and gender. For almost everyone, biological sex correlates with either anatomy or genetic type. (Not everyone -- there are intersex people, and people with various genetic variations, and the genetic basis of gender is actually quite complex -- but almost.) It's mostly a binary, and mostly familiar: boys and girls, men and women. \"Gender\" means something else, which is why it's a different word. Gender refers to how society understands masculine and feminine, how we dress and speak and act in ways that are associated with gender, and thus, how we see ourselves in the context of these social roles. Hairstyles, fashion choices, and social roles have nothing to do with anatomy; they have to do with society, and the specific markers of gender vary from place to place. To oversimplify it, the saying goes that sex is about what's between your legs, and gender is about what's between your ears. For the vast majority of people, gender and sex align. But for a small minority -- recent estimates say between 0.6 and 1 percent of the U.S. population -- they don't. This isn't just a preference, like wishing you had blonde hair instead of brown (more on that in a minute). It is, for many people, a painful mismatch between how they feel about this intimate, fundamental part of themselves and how they are seen in the world, or even in the mirror. This condition is known as gender dysphoria, which simply means a non-alignment of sex and gender. How do we know this? Well, if you know trans people, especially teenagers, it's obvious. Trans people just exist. They're not mentally ill, and if they're allowed to be who they are, they are as happy and unhappy as the rest of us. It's really quite simple, but since only 40 percent of Americans say they know someone trans, trans allies need to talk about it more. Alternatively, you can read up on four decades of scientific studies. While there's a fair amount of pseudoscience and polemical literature floating around today, the mainstream medical consensus remains clear: all 21 major medical organizations recognize gender dysphoria and the range of treatments for it. None deny it. These are facts . Science is not guided by public opinion . If it were, it would have concluded in the 1950s that different races have different levels of intelligence, or in the 1960s that homosexuality is a mental disorder. It is guided by data and the scientific method. The gender spectrum is also part of history. Many societies have more than two genders. In my Jewish tradition, the Talmud lists five . In India, the hijra are a third gender that is neither male nor female. The muxe people are a third gender in Mexico. These categories don't quite match up to today's scientific ones, but they point to the spectrum of gender that has always been part of human experience. It's even in religion. The Bible features many people whose gender expression or actions don't match their biological sex, like Jacob , described in predominantly feminine terms, and Deborah, described in masculine ones, not to mention eunuchs in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. If you're religious, you might even see gender diversity as part of God's design. Obviously, medical interventions to treat gender dysphoria are new, and it's reasonable to have questions about them. But so are Ozempic and Botox, not to mention chemotherapy and heart surgery. We intervene with 'nature' all the time when the health of our bodies and minds are at stake. Or even for preference; we color our hair and replace it when it falls out, we wear makeup, we undergo plastic surgery. We alter our bodies all the time. Let's remember what's at stake. This is a small and very vulnerable population: Over half of trans kids aged 12-18 have seriously considered committing suicide, according to surveys by the Trevor Project . Only 35 percent of trans teens say their families are supportive of them. The amount of airtime this small and vulnerable population receives from conservative politicians -- 614 anti-trans bills were proposed in 2024 alone -- is wildly out of proportion to reality. Now, I know that a lot of this is new, and a lot of it can be, well, difficult to grasp. I get that people are irritated by pronouns, and don't like being shamed for being politically incorrect. (Since I've simplified some things in this article, I'll probably catch some of that myself.) I also get that parents of girls (I am the parent of one) have legitimate concerns about safety and opportunity. So, sure, we can have conversations about sports, pronouns, and bathrooms. We can talk about when hormones or puberty blockers are appropriate, and what safeguards should be in place. We can call people into conversation, rather than call them out for their offenses. But that's not what's happening right now. What's happening is that vulnerable people are being exploited for political purposes, and people are saying things that are just not true. According to every medical organization in America, trans girls are not simply \"boys.\" Only a tiny sliver of trans teenagers undergo surgery, and then only after extensive counseling, screening, and other interventions. It is flat-out wrong to deny these facts -- and it is dangerous. Looking someone in the eye and saying \"I know your soul better than you do\" is a first step toward dehumanizing and oppressing them. My first question, whenever this happens, is always: Do you know someone trans? If you do, you know that gender identity isn't some delusion, or game, or preference, or tactic. Those are myths -- not unlike myths people used to tell about gay people, that we were child molesters, or mentally ill. We need more trans voices in the media to tell the truth, and we need more allies to speak up so they don't always have to. My second question is: Do you know the parent of a trans kid? They want what all parents want: what's best for their kids. Check out this Missouri dad who spoke to the state legislature there about his daughter. Why is the government getting in between parents, kids, and doctors when it comes to best-practices medical care? Why is this anyone's business but the families'? If you don't know trans kids or trans parents, your task is to listen to trans people directly, rather than listen to people talk about them. Listen to them talk about their lives, the pain of dysphoria and repression, the liberation of an authentic life. Watch Will and Harper , about Will Ferrell and his longtime friend who transitioned, or Ma Vie En Rose , or Disclosure , or Hearstopper . Read the anthologies Authentic Selves and Trans-Kin about trans people and their families, or Elliot Page's new memoir, or classics by Kate Bornstein , Leslie Feinberg, C.N. Lester , or Susan Stryker. There's an entire reading list of books by and about trans people produced by the organization PFLAG . As the right loves to say, \"do your research.\" Follow trans people online, like Imara Jones, Natalie Wynn, Abigail Thorn, Chase Strangio, Ivan Coyote, Charlotte Clymer, and Dylan Mulvaney , who was targeted in a vicious anti-trans campaign. If you're in a religious tradition, check out books by Justin Tanis, Joy Ladin, Cheryl Evans, and many others. The list goes on and on and on. Reasonable, thoughtful people are going to disagree about policies, on this as well as every other issue. That's how civil society functions. But wherever we come down on the issues, the only ethical way to talk about them is on the basis of science and reality, not myths and misunderstanding. We need to do better. At stake are hundreds of thousands of lives.\n"

      "Sunshine Man galloped for 35 minutes before the gunshot. The iconic palomino stallion died on the same open lands he had roamed for years, but they looked unfamiliar to him in his last desperate moments. The dust from the helicopter kicking up behind him, the roar of the blades ceaselessly bearing down -- it was enough to make him flee as fast as he could despite the leg he had snapped in half while trying to regain his freedom. His pursuers eventually tired of the chase, and a wrangler felled him with a rifle shot. Sunshine Man was one of 21 wild horses killed at the behest of the Bureau of Land Management during a 2023 roundup in Nevada. And 2024 is looking to be even bloodier as the agency seeks to capture 20,000 horses by September. At least 11 horses died in a single northern Nevada roundup as of June 29. Few people know that wild horses are being driven to near extinction by inhumane roundups perpetrated by the federal government and funded by taxpayers. Unless we do something to end this antiquated, barbaric practice, wild horses will disappear forever. A few years ago, my film crew and I set out on what would become a five-year journey across the American West to capture footage of wild horses for a film I was directing -- an adaptation of Anna Sewell's classic, Black Beauty . I have been a horse person since my youth; but it was on this trip, in the heart of the wild, that I first encountered the enduring magic and astounding beauty of these sacred symbols of American freedom. I also experienced the chilling conspiracy that was threatening to permanently eradicate them in the cruelest way imaginable. Under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 -- which established federal protections for wild horses -- the Bureau of Land Management is authorized to remove \"excess\" animals to protect the health of the range. For decades, the BLM has captured thousands of wild horses and burros, claiming that an overpopulation of wild horses is causing land degradation or that the horses are in danger of starvation. But a landmark 2013 study conducted by the independent National Academy of Sciences found that the Bureau's own justifications for removing wild horses and burros are not supported by science . The sinister truth is that wild horses are being used as a scapegoat for the multibillion-dollar livestock industry. Numerous independent studies and experts agree that livestock grazing, not wild horses, is the major cause of degrading public lands. A 2022 analysis of the Bureau's own data found that livestock outnumber wild horses and burros on public lands by more than 125:1. Livestock grazing is identified as a \"significant cause\" of land degradation in 72 percent of the areas that fail to meet rangeland health standards. Yet thousands of wild horses are still subject to violent roundups. In 2023, more than 5,000 wild horses and burros were removed from public lands, costing taxpayers about $160 million . I witnessed these horrific roundups firsthand while filming my documentary, Wild Beauty: Mustang Spirit of the West. The BLM uses helicopters to chase wild horses -- including pregnant mares, elderly horses, and foals no more than a day old -- for miles, sometimes in extreme heat, on grueling and dangerous terrain to the point of injury, exhaustion, and death. More horrific injuries occur as the terrified horses are forced into \"trap sites\" -- narrowly fenced-in areas on the range where the horses collide in the melee, sometimes breaking their legs or necks as they try to escape. The BLM repeatedly refused my film crew and journalists from the Associated Press access to the trap sites where deaths and injuries often occur. When we were eventually allowed access, we documented the horrendous conditions. We saw pain and terror in the horses' eyes as blood streamed down their faces. I'll never forget the sound of their cries as they were separated from their families. The BLM insists helicopter roundups are humane -- but there is nothing humane about using a helicopter to chase a highly intelligent, federally protected animal to its death. This is abuse. What is more infuriating is that the government spends millions of taxpayer dollars to hire roundup contractors, awarding one contractor, Cattoor Livestock Roundup Company, nearly $29 million alone. Even if a horse survives capture, there is no telling what awaits them. A lucky few are adopted into sanctuaries. Some 60,000 are incarcerated in holding facilities, often under appalling conditions, costing taxpayers $78 million annually . And many others are auctioned off to kill buyers, who ship them to Canada or Mexico for slaughter because the practice is illegal in the United States. The Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act of 2023 would help end this brutality by banning the use of helicopters and other aircraft in roundups to prevent needless cruelty, injury, and death. But to preserve our nation's natural wonder and beauty for future generations, and ensure no more horses endure what Sunshine Man did, rounding up wild horses and scapegoating them for the profit of billion-dollar livestock companies must end for good. This battle truly can feel like David versus Goliath, at times -- and the livestock industry has billions of dollars to spend on lobbying. However, wild horses are not voiceless. Quite the opposite. I've been in awe of the thousands of children who have joined the \"I Stand With Wild Horses\" campaign, contacting their lawmakers in an effort to save America's last wild horses. These young voices give me hope. To quote Anna Sewell's Black Beauty , \"if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves sharers in the guilt.\" Congress can no longer be sharers in the guilt. It's time to stand with wild horses.

      "The wealth of the world's very richest people -- a list dominated by U.S. billionaires , many of whom backed President-elect Donald Trump -- has soared to record levels since the election. Billionaires' investments to elect one of their own in Trump is paying off as Wall Street cash floods into the companies they control. Already, data shows that the ultra-wealthiest segments in the U.S. control a greater share of wealth than during the Gilded Age . Since 1989, the top 0.1 percent got over $14 trillion dollars richer than the entire bottom 50 percent of America, whose share of wealth has actually fallen. I closely track inequality in the U.S. and around the world. Americans should brace for an explosion in inequality under the next Trump administration. The Republican Party is preparing gigantic tax cuts for billionaires and corporations ; in 2017, then-President Trump gave the top 0.1 percent a tax cut 277 times larger than the middle-class. Tariffs would burden the poorest . In the firing line are workers' rights . Our trend data had expected the first trillionaire to arrive within a decade; expect him -- and it will be him -- to get here sooner. The United States and the world would be wise to also brace for a greater threat to freedom from extreme wealth. An oligarchy now has democracy in its grip. Their weaponization of racism and sexism has served them well, dividing the working-classes and pitting neighbors against one another -- as they plunder more wealth. Consider the horrors of the mass deportation that Trump has planned, and the chaos that would ensue. I use the word oligarchy, usually associated with rogue states, intentionally. Oligarchs are \" those empowered politically by massive wealth .\" Today's very richest Americans have not only amassed such startling levels of wealth but also power -- concentrating their monopoly control across industries, the media, and politics -- that to call them billionaires feels insufficient. It turns out they've bought a couch, if not a seat, in the Oval Office. Trump has already given a big job to Elon Musk , a man who bankrolled his victory, to oversee \"drastic change\" in a government that funds (and investigates) his companies. Who's in charge? The Republican Party deserves the spotlight for fueling astronomical wealth -- yet it would be a mistake to assign blame only to one party's doing. This moment is the long triumph of a bipartisan embrace of oligarchy over our politics . This path was chosen. For 40 years, Republicans and too many Democrats let the wealth of corporations and the ultra-rich rip: slashing taxes , deregulating labor markets , stagnating wages , subjugating public goods , and offering subservience to the power of monopoly and of capital . The future of our politics must reckon with uncomfortable truths. It is customary to lament the role that Ronald Reagan and other right-wing figures played in fueling inequality. But it's also important to analyze, objectively, how Bill Clinton shredded the country's social safety net , and how billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk saw their corporate power grow under Barack Obama. Or how the Obama presidency was able to bail out the banks but not some 10 million Americans who lost their homes . This path was also paved by compelling, if fictional, stories. We're still being told wealth trickles down ( it does not ), and that only big corporations innovate ( the public often has a critical role). Such fictions undermine efforts to tackle poverty, and flow wealth upwards. When Sen. Joe Manchin gutted an expanded child tax credit -- that cut child poverty in half -- he assured the nation, \" We all have to do our part. The federal government can't run everything .\" So that's how you justify pushing millions of children back into poverty . Often, fables are told by the liberal economics establishment -- as when it first denied, then reluctantly came to recognize , the role of big corporations' price gouging in driving inflation that made life for ordinary families even less affordable. It's worth imagining where we would be had we enacted windfall taxes on extreme profits and targeted price controls . Above all, the path of oligarchy has been about power, acting as the ultimate special interest group. Corporate monopolies are spending more than ever on federal lobbying . But big money countered not just policy but people-powered efforts -- be it labor unions , grassroots economic movements, or organizers for public housing and health care who fought against inequality. As Sen. Chris Murphy describes, so often they were \" shunned as dangerous populists .\" Still, advocates and activists carved out an interregnum from neoliberal economics as the anger against inequality became unavoidable. The Biden administration attempted new economic approaches, for a time. Workers chalked up victories . Anti-monopolists began to recast public policy against corporate concentration in favor of workers and small businesses, taking on non-compete clauses for example. Policymakers prepared proposals to, finally, tax billionaires . But even these limited attempts for a new economics have been fought tooth and nail by monied elites. A telling example of the bipartisan approach in action was seen during the election campaign when Democratic billionaire surrogate Mark Cuban and Republican billionaire surrogate Elon Musk both wanted the anti-monopolist chair of the Federal Trade Commission fired, and when both opposed proposals to make the tax system fairer. Heads they win, tails you lose. The capture of our political economy by a few is relevant to every question in our society. It includes the platforms we get our news from, many of which have been decimated by tech companies and deprived of independent voices . It includes war: The working-class know too well an establishment that is too broke to tackle rising hunger at home but rich enough to fund U.S. bombs that kill many thousands of children in Gaza . Who can blame working folks angry at elites for making a world that put them on the scrapheap? A generational contest for an economic vision that's different to the past 40 years is on. President-elect Trump and indeed Vice President-elect J.D. Vance (known for \" opposing Milton Friedman-backed policies \") seem to grasp the anger that the working class feel -- even as all signs point to an actual policy agenda right out of a billionaire's playbook. Their rush to deliver more tax cuts for their ultra-wealthy friends shows whose side they are on. The time is for choosing. An anti-oligarchy economics is due: one that serves multi-racial working-class interests and can address everyday financial issues. An economics that listens to people from the ground up -- backing the workers, innovators, and small businesses that make our economy tick -- as it breaks with big capital from above. Oligarchs look strong, but their self-centeredness is exposed when faced by popular and sensible politics that benefit ordinary folks, like strong unions; public goods like universal health care that make life affordable; bold climate action; taxing extreme wealth. Resistance is inevitable. But Franklin D. Roosevelt's words, taking on big money, instill fortitude: \"They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.\" Nabil Ahmed is an anti-inequality advocate and Director of Economic and Racial Justice at Oxfam America.\n"

      "This article is published in partnership with The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever's free newsletter . In 2008, I published a book with a straightforward premise: the upcoming era of American politics would be defined by a competition between the left and right to harness the working class's intensifying rage in a society being pillaged by corporate interests. It was the twilight of the Bush era, and the country was beginning its nose-dive into recession and turmoil, but hope and change seemed just over the horizon. I predicted that with elements of both political parties in a warrior stance, simmering conflicts over deindustrialization, financialization, and neoliberalism would soon explode and realign politics, birthing some American version of either social democracy or authoritarianism. The 16 years since The Uprising was released have delivered much of the tumult I imagined. It has been a period of unrest, chaos, and flip-flopping control of government -- and yet, amid all that volatility, the decline persisted. Whether medical bankruptcies, foreclosures, lower life spans, spikes in prices, mountains of paperwork, or endless junk fees attached to everything -- life in America just kept getting more difficult, annoying, inhumane, painful, and seemingly impossible. In the political arena, there was a sensation of change, but in real life, there was more of the same. Donald Trump 's 2016 win was a reaction to the dissonance -- a pressure cooker that finally exploded -- but still possibly just a weird anomaly. For shellshocked liberals, the end of his first term felt like the conclusion of a roller-coaster ride, a reversion to a mean, and proof that the competition to harness the discontent had finally been won on the center left. But as Trump surges and Democrats teeter in this blazing summer of discontent, it's the 2020 election that seems more like the anomaly -- a last rest stop on a wild Natural Born Killers -style jaunt. 2024 feels like the final destination in a journey bookended by two iconic roadside billboards: the \"HOPE\" poster featuring Barack Obama's cool gaze , and now the photograph of a bloodied Donald Trump defiantly calling his armies to battle. With polls suggesting a Republican landslide is possible in November, it seems that Democrats' staid, technocratic 'we-got-this' confidence of 2008 and its grandfatherly successor now in the White House may be no match for the bravado of the orange hair, the red hat, and the fist pump. After two of the biggest weeks of political news in a generation, the most intriguing mystery isn't whether Trump's policy program is more economically populist than Democrats' agenda ( it isn't ), whether his movement is serious ( it is ), or whether MAGA threatens what's left of democracy ( it does ). The big questions are about intangible vibes, brands, and emotions -- the forces that now determine elections. And those questions are haunting: How did the two political parties flip their zeitgeists? How did conservatism realign to become the revolution, while liberals transformed hope and change into more of the same? The GOP rebrand was long overdue. The party's Achilles heel was always its tenuous coalition described in Thomas Frank's seminal tome What's The Matter With Kansas? -- the paradoxical alliance between Bible thumpers' cultural conservatism, middle class strivers' anxiety, and country clubbers' greed. When the latter faction's political weakness was exposed by the final catastrophic years of the Bush era and then Mitt Romney's campaign, Trump found his opportunity to blow it all up in a social-media age that rewards the carnival barker. He barked his way through the Bush dynasty in the 2016 primary and then barked his way through the Clinton dynasty in the general. He pulled it off by rejecting the longstanding conventional wisdom of the 1990s and 2000s that assumed the most important batch of swing voters was in the affluent suburbs, where voters often prefer normalcy and revile disorder. MAGA belligerence instead courted the larger set of swing voters -- the disaffected working class . It was a wildly successful gambit. Trump comprehends what Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton before him knew: that politics is the permanent campaign . Everything -- no matter how urgent or bipartisan or mundane -- is an opportunity for conflict, controversy, chaos, and contrast with the opposition. Over so many years of scandal and celebrity, Trump's fighting posture became so intrinsic that he instinctively turned an assassination attempt into a photo op, screaming \"fight\" as if he was once again headlining a pro-wrestling match. Fight who? Fight what? That doesn't matter in elections decided by vibes and a society riven by the culture war. What matters is only the call to arms -- which both Trump and his party's younger stars innately understand. Behold Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) excoriating Boeing's CEO or Joe Biden 's judicial nominee from Wall Street, or watch Trump's running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) depicting himself as a pro-union anti-corporate crusader echoing Bernie Sanders, and you can envision a realigned American Right that solved its What's The Matter With Kansas? problem through permanent grievance. The result is the newfangled GOP's reactionary cultural agenda mixed with the argot of economic populism. \"The C-suite long ago sold out the United States, shuttering factories in the homeland and gutting American jobs, while using the profits to push diversity, equity, and inclusion and the religion of the trans flag,\" as Hawley put it this week in a sentence capturing both the righteous economic outrage and cartoonish cultural demagoguery on offer from the new GOP. Is that cultural extremism the sugar that makes the populist economic medicine go down the throat of the American Right? Or is it the other way around -- is the active ingredient the social agenda, and the economic rhetoric just the inert sweetener to trick disenchanted left-leaners into swallowing the real agenda, the cultural poison? There are arguments on both sides of that Rorschach test, but for now, it's still probably the latter. Either way, the ambiguity is shrewd politics in pursuit of the working-class electorate. And it's effective: Polls show Trump and his party are winning back larger shares of those constituencies, including in communities of color that Democrats long considered among their strongest base of support. Pining to go back to brunch , many liberals scoff at all this as neither smart politics or new. To them, it's just deplorables and rubes being hoodwinked by the same cynical right-wing politics. But if you aren't yet lobotomized by TikTok or cable TV news and you live here in the real economy of crushing costs, red tape, and that pervasive feeling that you're one medical diagnosis or arbitrary firing away from destitution, then you can at least understand why a thinking person might be able to see some of their own rage in the GOP's demagogues. Even if you don't agree with these Republicans; even if you know they are charlatans controlled by their own set of elites and their own form of (male and white) identity politics; even if you know a real estate tycoon and his venture-capitalist running mate are a ticket of oligarchs not populists -- even if you stipulate all of this, an honest observer can still understand how a non-rube struggling to survive the American economy can be drawn to conservatives' newly invigorated pugilism. Crazed and Howard Beale-ish as they may be, Republicans' primal screams at least seem like proof of life in a dying world. Democrats, by contrast, don't seem alive at all, and not just because they have been led by an octogenarian who drifts in and out of consciousness. Their problem is bigger than Biden. This is a party whose policy agenda of higher taxes on the rich and tougher regulation is a clear contrast with Trump's agenda -- much of which remains transactional Chamber of Commerce fare , despite the aesthetic rebrand. But the brand is the whole problem: Where Republicans wrap a corporate agenda in the costume of populist revolution, Democrats hide their populist agenda in the veneer of compromise, comity, and conflict aversion. This is a Democratic Party whose president has been most comfortable speaking in bromides about unity, rather than in clarion calls for justice. This is a party whose leaders have been most comfortable asking Supreme Court extremists to be nicer, rather than engaging in a direct confrontation with the justices who are repealing the 20th century. This is a party whose lawmakers have been most comfortable politely requesting Republicans to work with them, rather than trying to circumvent or bulldoze the GOP's obstructionism. In this, many Americans see a party committed to respecting institutions they dislike, and pledging to defend norms they despise. It is still the party of the \"HOPE\" poster, even though it is a moment when billionaires, corporations, and the accelerated pace of technological change are pulping the last drops of hope out of the working class. The Democrats' current brand contrast could not be more tone deaf to the times. Where Trump fist pumps after getting shot and his minions instantly blame their opponents for the violence, Democrats reflexively stand down and apologize . Where Trump does battle with recalcitrant Republican legislators, Biden has coddled his party's obstructionists as they undermine his presidency. Where Trump executes the final step of a master plan to permanently tilt the entire judiciary, Biden has spent most of his term opposing efforts to undo that scheme. Where Trump's movement outlines the radical reshaping of society in a detailed Wall Street-funded treatise, Democrats who still control parts of the government have cited the filibuster, the next election, Joe Manchin , the Senate's unelected parliamentarian , Kyrsten Sinema , and any number of other laughable reasons why they can't fight for anything more than civility. And most recently, where Trump energetically lied his way to a dominating debate performance, Biden ambled onstage looking like he doesn't even know where he is, totally unable to promote his agenda, much less sell it as a challenge to power. To be sure, it's not that Democrats have done nothing. Their political problem is that they have been uninterested in, averse to, and -- with the elderly Biden -- incapable of casting their party as any kind of vanguard. They have shied away from waging protracted, messy battles in pursuit of ideals. After all, that might be uncivil and \"politically unrealistic,\" in the vernacular of Washington. Time and again, they've made clear their foremost objective is being seen as pragmatic and polite, as competent managers of societal decline -- regardless of what principles are being sacrificed in the transaction. This brand of Democratic politics emerged when I was finishing The Uprising in the late aughts, when New Deal-ish aspirations were still a flicker in the liberal mind. Back then, Obama was swept into office with huge congressional majorities, and promised to channel the fighting spirit in epic battles for expansive health care reform and serious financial regulation. But in retrospect, his health care and financial initiatives don't look like fights at all -- they look like surrenders designed to ward off pressure for more expansive changes , all in defense of manners. Though the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank bill included some important reforms, those signature initiatives were lucrative giveaways to health insurers and Wall Street behemoths as millions of Americans continued to be foreclosed on , medically bankrupted , and permanently disillusioned about the prospect for change. Obama all but admitted his primary goal was good decorum and conflict aversion. He wrote that prosecuting bank executives in the wake of the financial crisis \"would have required a violence to the social order, a wrenching of political and economic norms, that almost certainly would have made things worse.\" That social order soon after rewarded him with a palatial Chicago library and a Martha's Vineyard mansion to shelter within amid Democrats' historic loss of power and Trump's subsequent rampage. When Covid finally delivered Democrats their narrow 2020 victory, Biden seemed to learn a lesson from his predecessor's failures, using the mandate of his first few months as president to make a historic investment in the country's working class. But when it got hard -- when he and his party would've had to muster a fighting spirit and wage a public battle to continue that investment -- scrappy Scranton Joe reverted to Glass Joe . He and Democratic congressional leaders folded in order to preserve comity and avoid too much friction, just like they did when they whittled down their Build Back Better bill into the far less ambitious Inflation Reduction Act, and just like they have in response to the Supreme Court's assault. More recently, while the White House staff has been focused on covering up the president's cognitive decline, a few feisty appointees at a handful of alphabet agencies have waged an increasingly successful guerrilla war against monopolies, predatory lenders, and crypto scammers. But those battles are rarely a central part of the Democratic story. The party's media machine is almost exclusively focused on agitprop about \"saving democracy,\" protecting \"the soul of America,\" and other paeans that are torn from Aaron Sorkin's West Wing scripts and that mean nothing to voters who are one family emergency away from bankruptcy. Recognizing Republicans recasting themselves as revolutionary warriors is not to venerate Trump's elitist record of corporate fealty -- nor is it to suggest he's changed his ways and become anything other than a plutocrat on policy. On the contrary, Trump and his movement are doubling down on their old corporate agenda in an increasingly successful quest for financial support from the same oligarchy that his anti-establishment brand purports to stand against. Trump's running mate is also following that bait-and-switch formula -- after helping lobbyists water down his own rail safety bill , Vance followed up his vice presidential nomination by letting other lobbyists know he'll now be abandoning his own credit card fee legislation that was supposed to prove his Hillbilly Elegy credo. The same goes for the Democrats: Recognizing their rebrand as defenders of stasis is not to ignore their accomplishments. The macroeconomy is decent, and many of Biden's economic policies are better than any administration's of the last 50 years (which says more about how low the bar is). But there's policy, and then there's politics -- and the political landscape is tough for Democrats right now because the adage about a difference between campaigning and governing is wrong. At the presidential level, governing is campaigning, but Biden and his White House seem incapable of doing that part -- the part where the president looks like he's fighting for something... anything. The result is a vast chasm on a Gallup poll metric that can decide elections: Americans see Biden as a far weaker leader than Trump. Of course, Democratic leaders don't lack the capacity to fight. The brutal 2008 primary and general election that kicked off this era proved that Democrats absolutely can scratch, claw, cheap-shot, and groin-kick as adroitly as Trump when they want to. But lately, they've mostly chosen to aim their political assaults downward at their most promising upstarts and now at their most stalwart foot soldiers. There was the show of force against Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 campaigns, the latter of which effectively ended when the Vermont senator publicly apologized for his surrogate daring to tell the truth about Biden. There is the shock and awe of incumbent protection in primaries, where challengers are routinely spent into the ground. There is the blacklisting and banishment of those who step out of line. And now there is the omerta protecting the withering president as he teeters on the precipice of a landslide loss. Despite having no shortage of strong , experienced, and geographically ideal replacement candidates, Democrats spent the last month ignoring their own voters' growing concerns about Biden and manufacturing a cone of silence in the president's defense. Its enforcers have been a bizarre coalition of former presidents , party apparatchiks , and power brokers . Even the erstwhile upstarts who once stood as the glimmers of dissent and possibility joined in -- shamed and disciplined for their past apostasy, they assembled to be the Dear Leader's loyalty police . It's a reminder that if Democrats could muster even half the fighting spirit in combat with MAGA that they routinely muster for fighting their own left flank, they might be in a stronger electoral position -- and the country might be on a better track. When I wrote The Uprising sixteen years ago, that better track is what I dreamed of. I had worked for Sanders and the old New Dealer Dave Obey in the House in those gloomy days of terrorist attacks and tax cuts at the beginning of the Bush presidency. I had then helped elect Brian Schweitzer governor of Montana as he pioneered a new form of prairie populism, and I had done a stint working for Ned Lamont, whose Connecticut Senate primary seemed to open up the possibility of a feistier, angstier, more democratic politics on the center-left. As dark as those last few years of the Bush tenure were, a sense of hope and possibility percolated toward the end of the 2000s because the Democrats seemed positioned as the fighters and the Republicans the stasis. At the time, I sounded a lonely alarm about Obama's fealty to establishment boundaries. I did so not out of spite, but out of that same sense of, yes, hope. After the Iraq War and the financial crisis and the recession, I hoped the uprisings on both sides of the ideological spectrum might encourage some kind of Rooseveltian mix of substance, aspiration, and constructive \"welcome their hatred\" populism. I didn't yet grasp that Democrats were discarding their fighting spirit -- and Republicans were embracing theirs. Unless that asymmetry changes in the next few weeks, this moment could end up as pivotal and as ominous as it seems -- a transition to a darker, harsher, more menacing normal that almost certainly will not make America great again.\n"

      "The recent identification of 400 Iraq War veterans potentially exposed to chemical weapons has brought renewed attention to the critical role of the Veterans Exposure Team-Health Outcomes Military Exposures (VET-HOME) program. This initiative, launched under the PACT Act of 2022, offers specialized care for veterans suffering from military environmental exposures, providing essential telehealth evaluations and personalized care plans. That progress is now under threat. If the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) were privatized under policies proposed by former President Donald Trump , programs like VET-HOME could be dismantled, leaving veterans without the specialized care they need. During Trump's presidency, his administration's push to expand private health care through the VA Mission Act sparked significant controversy. Trump framed the legislation as increasing \"choice\" for veterans, but many major veterans' organizations saw it as a step toward privatization. They feared that expanding private care options would divert resources from VA facilities, undermining the quality of care that veterans rely on. This tension between the desire for more choices and the need to protect the integrity of the VA's specialized services has only intensified over time. The situation has been further complicated by the recent Supreme Court decision to dismantle \" Chevron deference,\" which allowed federal agencies like the VA to interpret ambiguous laws within their jurisdiction. The Chevron doctrine, established by the high court in 1984, empowered the VA to implement complex laws passed by Congress, ensuring that veterans received the support they needed. With its removal, every interpretation the VA makes is now open to judicial review , creating a legal quagmire that could delay or deny essential services to veterans. This shift in the legal landscape poses a severe risk to the VA's ability to function effectively. The VA must be able to adapt to new challenges and make quick decisions about how best to serve veterans. Without Chevron , the VA is vulnerable to an onslaught of legal challenges that could disrupt its operations and erode the quality of care it provides. This instability plays directly into the hands of private health care interests, which have long sought to privatize the VA and gain access to its substantial budget. The potential privatization of the VA would have devastating consequences for veterans. The VA is specifically designed to address the unique health care needs of those who have served, including treatment for combat-related injuries, mental health support, and care for conditions like PTSD and toxic exposures. A privatized system would likely struggle to provide the same level of specialized care, leaving many veterans without access to the services they need. Any privatization of the VA would fundamentally undermine the promise America has made to its veterans. The VA is more than just a health care provider; it is a community and a support system for those who have sacrificed for our nation. Privatizing the VA would not only dismantle this community but also place profits over the well-being of veterans. This is not just a policy issue -- it is a moral one. We owe it to our veterans to ensure that they receive the best care possible, not just the care that is most profitable. The PACT Act, which has expanded health care and benefits to millions of veterans, is a testament to what a well-funded and well-managed VA can achieve. Since the law's passage, the VA has launched the largest outreach campaign in its history, resulting in over 740,000 veterans enrolling in VA health care -- a 33 percent increase compared to previous periods. The VA has also received more than 4.4 million claims for disability compensation benefits over the past two fiscal years, driven by expanded eligibility for presumptive conditions under the PACT Act. The VA's groundbreaking efforts to reach out to veterans through digital tools, a national advertising campaign, and thousands of community events have paid off. Trust in the VA has reached an all-time high of 80.2 percent , a significant increase from the 55 percent recorded in 2016. The VA's commitment to bringing care to veterans, rather than making them come to the VA, has been a game-changer, improving access and reducing wait times. However, all of this progress is now at risk. With the dismantling of Chevron deference, the VA's ability to interpret and implement laws is under threat. If the VA loses its authority to make new rules, it could become entangled in endless legal battles, leaving veterans caught in the crossfire of privatization efforts and regulatory paralysis. This legal uncertainty threatens to undo the progress made under the PACT Act and could lead to a VA that is no longer able to meet the needs of the veterans it was created to serve. The future of the VA hangs in the balance. A second Trump administration, combined with the loss of Chevron deference, could cripple the VA's ability to serve those who have sacrificed for our nation. We must protect the VA from privatization and ensure that it remains the cornerstone of care for those who have served. The stakes are too high to do otherwise. Our veterans deserve nothing less.

      "Give Eric Adams some credit: He put his back into this one. Once the mayor of New York was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges, the man and his legal team worked overtime to get President Donald Trump to somehow overturn the case. Adams was indicted in late September for allegedly doing favors for the Turkish government as payback for illegal campaign donations and travel perks. Almost instantly, he started floating Trump-friendly conspiracy theories that the prosecution was a Joe Biden revenge plot. He stood up for then-candidate Trump when his opponent dared to call him a fascist. Adams has now reportedly directed his subordinates to only say nice things in public about the president -- anything, really, for the Don. On Monday night, Trump returned the favor, when his Justice Department ordered prosecutors in Manhattan to drop their charges against the mayor, two months before he was set to go to trial. This get-out-of-jail card isn't free, though. It practically demands that Adams implement Trump's deportation agenda, and it leaves open the possibility that Adams could be charged again if he doesn't go along with the program. Legal observers tell me they've never seen a deal quite like it before. And while Adams may have been the most obvious and immediate beneficiary, he's not the only one. If you're a foreign government or a corrupt company trying to turn a public official into your toady, Monday's move sends a powerful signal -- one of many -- that America is open for business. Everything and everyone is up for sale. Just name your price, and start the negotiation. That might sound a little over-the-top, especially when the case against Adams felt a little small, if cut-and-dried. Adams is alleged to have fixed some fire permits in exchange for some first-class flights and a bunch of straw donations. Icky, but happens all the time, right? Well, no. And also, the directive to drop Adams' case can't be viewed in isolation. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded the corporate enforcement unit of DOJ's National Security Division -- the prosecutors who went after the people stealing company secrets on behalf of China, or illicitly financing Russia's war in Ukraine. She also broke up the task force that seized the yachts of Russian oligarchs, or busted them for violating global sanctions. At the same time, she killed a 50-person task force, established during the first Trump administration, to investigate covert foreign influence -- attempts to steer U.S. policy through clandestine means. (Think of the $10 million that a Kremlin-backed media operation steered to MAGA influencers in last year's election.) \" It's now a free for all for foreign intel services ,\" former head of FBI counterintelligence Frank Figliuzzi told NBC News. And if Bondi has her way, criminal investigations like the one that exposed that $10 million influencer network will be a thing of the past. Last week, Bondi ordered prosecutors to dramatically scale back their investigations of violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. That's the law, passed after World War II, when the Nazis got a bunch of Congressmen to secretly push their agenda. The idea was to stop that kind of covert propaganda. The law lay dormant for decades, until 2016's election interference. Since then, FARA prosecutions had gone through the roof. This new Bondi directive stops all that. Remember the case against Pras, the Fugees' rapper, for acting as an agent of China ? Some of those charges likely wouldn't have happened under Bondi's new rules. Or the one against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who got all those gold bars in exchange for doing favors for the Egyptian government? Or the one involving Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who allegedly took $600,000 to covertly do the business of Azerbaijan? Same. Gone. Criminal FARA probes from now on, Bondi wrote, \"shall be limited to instances of alleged conduct similar to more traditional espionage by foreign government actors.\" But we already have laws and lawyers to stop secret-stealing and the like. FARA is for something different. Perhaps this is the moment when I should mention the attorney general herself was, until recently, a registered foreign lobbyist for the government of Qatar -- earning a rather nice salary of $115,000-per-month . And that Trump's pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, was also working for the Qatari government, but without bothering to register . And that on Monday, Trump sacked the head of the Office of Government Ethics . The last time he was president, Trump took in $8 million or so in direct payments from 20 foreign governments. During his last campaign, he asked oil and gas executives for $1 billion in exchange for rolling back Joe Biden's environmental policies; he also told donors he would immediately approve new pipelines and speed up oil company mergers. For his second inaugural, he celebrated by launching a meme coin that seems to outside experts to be tailor-made for foreign payoffs . And let's not forget the $2 billion Trump's son-in-law and top adviser got from the Saudi government for his investment fund. Corruption has never been antithetical to the Trump brand, and it surely isn't now. Now his Justice Department is making moves so that everyone can get in on the fun -- if they stay loyal. On Monday, Trump pardoned disgraced Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who was sent to prison for trying to sell Barack Obama's old Senate seat. Trump also signed an executive order directing his new attorney general, Bondi, to \"pause\" enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act -- the law that forbids Americans from bribing foreign officials. \" It's going to mean a lot more business for America ,\" the president said. Then there's the Adams situation. The indictment was supposed to be just the appetizer in a full-course meal, one of five federal investigations into Adams and his inner circle. The bigger federal case, many observers felt, was the one out of Brooklyn, where a Chinese billionaire had already pleaded guilty to giving straw donations to Adams. The one where there was strong evidence of a wider scheme of straw donations, orchestrated by a top fundraiser with ties to Beijing . A memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove effectively stops all of these probes (even though it's addressed only to the prosecutors in Manhattan). In it, Bove \"block[s] further targeting of Mayor Adams or additional investigative steps.\" Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro, in a statement, crowed that \"the Department of Justice has reevaluated this case and determined it should not go forward.\" But there's more to Bove's memo. It \"defers to the U.S. Attorney's Office at this time\" about \"the strength of the evidence\" in the case. In other words, Bove is admitting, at least provisionally, that the initial prosecution was solid. He's also holding open the possibility that the cases could get revived, maybe if Adams gets crosswise with Team Trump. \"In theory, there's nothing preventing the U.S. Attorney's office from filing new charges in November,\" says Arlo Devlin-Brown, a former chief of the public corruption unit at the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. There are things Trump and his team clearly want in return for holding those prosecutors at bay. In his memo, Bove ordered Adams' case to be dropped so the mayor could \"devote [his] full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies of the prior administration.\" Last week, City Hall issued a draft memo directing public school and migrant shelters to let ICE agents onto their properties without a warrant \"if, at any time, you reasonably feel threatened or fear for your safety .\" That appeared to be at odds with current local laws, which all but forbid cooperation with ICE on the enforcement of purely civil matters, like immigration status. Adams' administration released updated guidance on Monday that hew more closely to the previous legal standards. But the day's events left critics like mayoral candidate Zellnor Myrie wondering, \"What was this mayor willing to give up? Which New Yorkers was he willing to sell ?\" Public corruption is often viewed as a victimless crime. Not if the price for Adams' exoneration winds up being paid by immigrant kids. Trump and his team have previously mocked the \" thirsty \" mayor for going to any and all lengths to avoid a conviction. Earlier on Monday, according to local news site The City, Adams took things to another level. He ordered local officials not to publicly criticize Trump in any way -- and not to interfere with immigration enforcement. That's the thing about corrupt bargains. There are always more strings attached to the deal.\n"

      "You can't please all the people all of the time -- even if you're as popular as Taylor Swift . Having attained a somehow higher level of mega-celebrity with her record-breaking Eras Tour and a closely followed romance with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs (who are headed back to the Super Bowl as the defending NFL champs), the singer now faces the perplexing wrath of MAGA conspiracy theorists who have decided the league and the relationship are rigged to help Joe Biden 's chances in the 2024 presidential election . The premise is as disconnected from reality as it sounds, but it's all the stranger given that this courtship between a pop icon and football star -- both white, Christian, good-looking, wholesome public figures -- should fit the all-American conservative ideal. And Swift herself long retained her mass appeal with a mostly apolitical presence on the world stage, only voicing liberal positions and endorsing a select few Democrats from 2018 onward. But it was, in part, this late entry into civic discourse that allowed right-wingers to sell themselves a narrative of Swift as a propaganda puppet, after years in which some ardently worshiped her as a blonde, blue-eyed avatar for white supremacy. Here's the complete timeline of how the far right fell in, and out of, love with Taylor Swift. Pre-2016: Country Roots Swift came up in the Nashville scene, from the age of 14, as a country singer-songwriter inspired by the likes of Dolly Parton and Shania Twain. Her debut single, \"Tim McGraw,\" alluded to her love of another country legend -- and her early hits climbed the genre's charts along with heartland tunes full of cowboy twang and pickup trucks. Whatever the identities of individual performers, this music has always been conservative-coded, and its biggest names have rarely shied away from an aggressive style of red-meat patriotism . Swift, of course, was a teenager singing about innocent young love: She only happened to suit the fantasy of a small-town girl next door that informs so much Americana. (And she certainly didn't have Parental Advisory stickers on her CDs.) It was when she started to drift from these roots on Red (2012), and fully embraced electronic pop with 1989 (2014), that fans could begin to think of her as totally distinct from the traditionalist milieu of her early career. The latter's \"Welcome to New York\" signaled a new, cosmopolitan life far from the backroads of country radio. In fact, a civilian Donald Trump was blasting the album's second single, \"Blank Space,\" while driving around with wife Melania and son Barron, as seen in a 2014 video Melania shared on her Facebook page. 2015-2016: Alt-Right Appropriation Trump's rise as a political powerhouse in the 2016 Republican presidential primary coincided with the arrival of what was soon labeled the \"alt-right\": a younger, more online, and increasingly extreme faction of the conservative movement that rejected the usual Republicans in favor of explicit white nationalism. Trump was their man. Swift, meanwhile, was between albums -- and much discussion of her focused on a feud with Kanye West over the lyric \"I made that bitch famous\" in his song \"Famous,\" referring to when he interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, a moment that had become an indelible meme. The ascendant alt-right, shitposters by nature, saw a chance to disingenuously claim Swift for their own, as both a secret Trump supporter and neo-Nazi. (It didn't seem to matter that she had previously expressed her happiness at Barack Obama taking the White House in 2008, her first election.) The attempt to rebrand her had older, murky origins, including 4chan in-jokes and a Pinterest user who in 2013 went viral for images falsely attributing Hitler quotes to Swift , but picked up steam as Trump did. Andrew Anglin, founder of the white supremacist website the Daily Stormer, declared her an \"aryan goddess,\" while Milo Yiannopoulis, in a column for Breitbart, explained why she was an \"alt-right pop icon,\" noting her whiteness, blondeness, unrevealing clothes, lack of piercings, and occasional mini-scandals over music videos accused of racist undertones . It probably didn't help that Swift endorsed neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump, leaving room for misinformation about how she secretly voted for the GOP candidate. Following Trump's victory, some Democrats vented their frustration at Swift's silence during the campaign, believing she could have moved the needle for Clinton. And to this day, it's alarmingly easy to find crude images of Swift in Nazi regalia or juxtaposed with fascist slogans. It appears that no matter what she says, a subset of trolls are devoted to the vision. 2017-2018: Taking a Stand With 2017's Reputation , Swift further developed her feminist themes and cred, and she faced additional pressure to use her voice to political ends. After the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, some called for her to disavow her neo-Nazi fans once and for all. First, however, Swift appeared in court to testify against a former DJ who was fired from his Denver radio station after groping her at a 2013 event and later sued her for defamation, claiming he'd done no such thing. Swift had countersued for assault and battery, seeking a symbolic $1 in damages. When a jury trial commenced in August 2017, Swift's lawyer proclaimed that she was \"taking a stand for all women.\" She won the case. In the following months, the #MeToo movement shed light on how often sexual misconduct is dismissed or covered up to the perpetrator's benefit, and Swift became one of the founding signatories of Time's Up, an advocacy group for survivors, and donated to its legal defense fund. None of this was likely to endear Swift to conservatives who had already begun to argue that #MeToo had \"gone too far,\" yet she continued to press the issue, gracing the cover of Time 's Person of the Year issue along with fellow \" silence breakers .\" And the next year, she finally waded into electoral politics, sharing on Instagram that she would be backing Democratic congressional candidates in Tennessee for the 2018 midterms. \"In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now,\" she wrote before excoriating Republican senate hopeful Marsha Blackburn as an enemy of gender equality and LGBTQ rights based on her legislative record (and encouraging her followers to register to vote). Blackburn would clinch the seat anyway, but Swift's influence was not lost on her -- now up for reelection, the senator sounds more than a little worried about what Swift could say this time around. 2019-2020: The Activist By 2019, Swift's politics were no mystery. She was openly in favor of gun-control reform , took a pro-choice stance against government attempts to crack down on abortion, gave a surprise performance at New York's Stonewall Inn for that year's Pride celebration, and urged the senate to pass anti-discrimination laws . Any far-right fan clinging to the notion that she harbored extremist views would've been in clinical denial. For the most part, conservative commentators got in the habit of attacking her as they would any other liberal entertainer with a massive platform. Ben Shapiro, for one, complained of her \"abrupt and obviously pandering shift into a political wokescold.\" At last, Swift also formally denounced any admiration from the racist far right in a cover story interview with Rolling Stone . \"There's literally nothing worse than white supremacy,\" she said. \"It's repulsive. There should be no place for it.\" She explained that she feared a 2016 endorsement of Hillary Clinton could have backfired, since Clinton's celebrity support was \"used against her in a lot of ways.\" As for conservatives who had once assumed she was on their side, she quipped, \"I don't think they do anymore.\" In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, Swift came out strongly in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. \"Racial injustice has been ingrained deeply into local and state governments, and changes MUST be made there,\" she tweeted that June, and donated to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, encouraging her fans to do likewise. She also strongly criticized Trump's threats of violent crackdowns on BLM protests in a tweet that promised: \"We will vote you out in November.\" Around the same time, she called for the removal of Confederate monuments that \"celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things.\" During the presidential election, she criticized Trump and officially endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket, saying the Democratic nominees would begin a \"healing process.\" Fair to say that whatever remaining allure she had for reactionaries and Trump voters had completely dried up. 2021-2024: Taylor Derangement Syndrome The \"aryan goddess\" interpretation of Swift had been more or less put to bed by the time Biden assumed office. But the reorganizing MAGA right had little reason to single her out among the legions of professional entertainers who express their distaste for Trump here and there. She didn't endorse candidates in the 2022 midterms, either, though she did communicate her dismay at the overturning of Roe v. Wade . Conservatives who bothered to take a swipe at her tended toward lazy outrage bait: calling her boring, overrated, or a lonely cat lady (mind you, she was in a long-term relationship with actor Joe Alwyn that was heavily covered by the tabloids). In 2021, Swift embarked on the formidable project of rerecording her first six studio albums after the rights to that catalog were sold to a company run by controversial music mogul Scooter Braun , and released the hit record Midnights in 2022. It was in 2023 that American conservatism launched into an enduring freakout about Swift, her cultural dominance, and her potential influence on voters. Anyone dimly aware of the Eras Tour -- an unprecedented run of sold-out stadium shows -- could see she had reached another pinnacle of success, and amassed a near-cultish audience of millions who hung on her every utterance. We got plenty of think pieces on whether this was a good or bad phenomenon, with varied musings on how Swift had created her own monoculture. The sheer saturation of Taylor content was enough to irk those less disposed to her vibe -- and there were gripes about that, too. In the fall, confirmation of a budding romance between Swift, who had broken up with Alwyn earlier in the year, with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce sent right-wingers over the edge . Was it not enough that Swift should have a chokehold on the music industry, these detractors asked. Did she have to conquer their sacred sport of football as well, shown every few minutes in cutaway reaction shots as she cheered Kelce on from his private stadium suite, with NFL announcers shoehorning the titles of her songs into play calls? Her cheerleader energy was distinctly unwelcome in the game; berserk haters told her she was \" ruining football \" and tried to manifest a Taylor \" curse \" for the Chiefs, who nonetheless won the AFC championship and will return to the Super Bowl after winning it last year. Along the way, crusty conservative publications disgorged a slew of anti-Swiftie polemics. The National Review hardly paused their parade of takes, railing against both \" The Incoherence of Taylor Swift \" and \" The Averageness of Taylor Swift \" when they weren't warning that \" Taylor Swift Is Coming for Your Daughters .\" The Federalist swung for the fences with a column headlined \" Taylor Swift's Popularity Is a Sign of Societal Decline .\" The tantrum grew louder still when Swift was announced as Time 's Person of the Year for 2023, triggering feverish accusations of conspiracy . \"What's happening with Taylor Swift is not organic,\" seethed notorious former Trump adviser Stephen Miller . The far-right X (formerly known as Twitter) account \"End Wokeness\" warned that \"the regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024.\" One-time Pizzagate promoter Jack Posobiec tweeted that the \"Taylor Swift girlboss psyop has been fully activated.\" This roiling paranoia about Swift's omnipresence, combined with the Chiefs' playoff run and Kelce's turn as a spokesman for Pfizer 's Covid-19 vaccine, culminated in unhinged speculation about the NFL being \"rigged\" to carry the Swift/Kelce relationship storyline into the most-watched broadcast event of the year. This, said many extremely online conservatives -- including failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy -- would set the stage for Swift to endorse Biden for 2024, and perhaps worse calamities. Right-wing influencer Rogan O'Handley, for example, begged the San Francisco 49ers to defeat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. \"If you don't, Mr. Pfizer and his girlfriend are going to tour the country as 'world champions' helping elect Joe Biden,\" he tweeted, adding that World War III \"will likely follow\" in a second Biden term, \"and millions will die.\" These kinds of comments were so outlandish, so utterly divorced from a material understanding of what could possibly hang in the balance of a football game, that some organs of conservative media tried to quell the mania. \"Demonizing Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce paints the right as deranged,\" wrote sports columnist Jason Whitlock for the Blaze, while the National Review , evidently unaware of their role in promoting the Swift panic, sounded a note of desperation with a piece titled \" For the Love of God, Taylor Swift Is Not a Joe Biden 'Psyop.' \" Those pleas appear to have had little effect; 11 days out from the Super Bowl, far-right YouTuber Benny Johnson shared an AI -generated deepfake on X that appeared to show one local news anchor after another saying \" Taylor Swift is not a psyop ,\" presenting the bogus clip as evidence of a nefarious plot behind the pop star's almost universal recognition. The post was viewed more than 1 million times in nine hours. The release of The Tortured Poets Department in April inevitably (and unfortunately) brought a new round of grousing. Sean Feucht, the far-right \"MAGA Pastor,\" raised the alarm on social media , saying \"half the songs\" on the album \"contain explicit lyrics (E), make fun of Christians, and straight up blaspheme God.\" And lest you think he's \"just being religious & overreacting,\" Feucht shared several apparently offending lyrics that certainly dabble in classic religious imagery, but in the most basic, writerly way imaginable. Among the most harrowing lines, to Feucht: \"I would've died for your sins, instead I just died inside\" (from \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\"); \"What If I roll the stone away/They're gonna crucify me anyway\" (\"Guilty as Sin\"); and \"God save the most judgmental creeps/Who say they want what's best for me/Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see,\" from \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" which definitely seems more critical of Swift's own fans than an entire religion. And, of course, Shapiro got back in on the action as well with a YouTube video dubbed, \"Taylor Swift's New Album Is GARBAGE\" and nuanced opinions like, \"Can we stop pretending she's high art?\" and, \"She's so tortured that she's worth billions of dollars for singing songs that are most appropriately sung by 16 and 17 year old girls.\" Meanwhile, the conservative media's old guard, while not going so far as to embrace the \"scripted\" NFL theory, took the prospect of Swift endorsing a second Biden term quite seriously: Fox News host Sean Hannity cautioned Swift to \" think twice \" about throwing in with Biden's reelection campaign. Key players in MAGA world are preparing for a \"holy war\" against Swift should she come out in favor of Biden, as Rolling Stone has reported . Trump himself, associates said, privately grumbled that he is \" more popular \" than her, apparently unwavering in his belief that no celebrity, however huge, could help his incumbent rival. Yet when the former president holds you in this special contempt, well, there's no denying that you've made it as an arch-nemesis of the American far right. Late 2024: AI Fakes and Kamala Harris Endorsement Once Biden decided to quit his reelection bid in July following a disastrous debate performance against Trump, Democrats were quick to coalesce around Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's presidential nominee. She selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and headlined a celebratory DNC as her campaign gathered momentum and enthusiasm. Over these weeks, Swift faced increasing pressure to wield her influence by endorsing Harris. (Some also wondered how it might affect her newish friendship with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whose politics came under scrutiny when she liked a post from Trump on Instagram that laid out the 2024 GOP platform.) A \" Swifties for Kamala \" coalition emerged, made up of Swift fans mobilizing to elect progressive Democrats up and down the ballot, Harris included. In August, evidently hoping to swoop in and create the impression that he had Swift's endorsement locked up, Trump shared AI-generated images suggesting as much. One featured a bogus crowd scene of women marching in \"Swifties for Trump\" shirts, while the other depicted Swift as Uncle Sam. That one was captioned \"Taylor Wants You to Vote for Donald Trump.\" In his Truth Social post disseminating the images, Trump wrote, \"I accept!\" Later, questioned about the bogus pictures, he pleaded ignorance of their origins, saying only that someone else made them. Clearly, elements of the far right believed they could still co-opt Swift for their own purposes, despite her record of criticizing Trump and backing Democrats. But any possibility of this evaporated once Harris and Trump met for their own debate in September, after which Swift posted her endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket on Instagram (much to the delight of Swifties for Kamala). She cited the AI images Trump had circulated, and explained that the simplest way to combat misinformation was with the truth. Harris, she wrote, would be a strong leader, adding that she believed \"we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\" She also praised Harris' choice of Walz for VP and said she would share resources to help her followers register to vote. Trumpworld, already reeling from a debate in which their candidate spewed outrageous lies and failed to stay on message, responded with weird threats and innuendos. \"I was not a Taylor Swift fan,\" Trump said the next morning when he called into Fox News . He commented that he liked Brittany Mahomes better, evidently looking to drive a wedge between the women. \"But she's a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat,\" he said of Swift, \"and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.\" Trump's running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, also on Fox News, tried to play down Swift's importance in the election. \"I don't think most Americans [...] are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans,\" he said, inadvertently offering what some would call an accurate description of Trump. Late on the night of the debate, another out-of-touch billionaire Elon Musk -- who made his support for Trump public after the July assassination attempt that saw the GOP nominee grazed by a bullet -- made a creepy overture to Swift. Because she had signed her Instagram post \"Childless Cat Lady\" in a rebuke to Vance's negative comments about unwed women without children, Musk wrote on X, \"Fine Taylor ... you win ... I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\" The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has 12 known children by various mothers and has frequently warned about \"population collapse.\" Many deemed the post a form of sexual harassment, while some fantasized about Kelce beating him up for it. Right-wing political commentator Dave Rubin went a step further with his remarks the day following the debate, first praising Musk's tweet for \"exposing the ridiculousness.\" He went on to imply that Swift would be sexually assaulted by migrants under a Harris administration: \"Taylor Swift, you are a young pretty girl, do you know what the gang members from Venezuela do to young pretty girls?\" he said. \"It ain't pretty.\" Other far-right pundits kept their takes bluntly contemptuous. Ben Shapiro tweeted , \"Note: if you vote for a particular candidate because your favorite singer is doing so, please don't vote. You are too stupid to vote.\" None of it stopped Swift's endorsement from racking up almost 10 million likes in less than a day, nor hundreds of thousands of followers from clicking on a voter registration link she shared in her Instagram stories. Overall web searches for registration resources jumped as well . It's been a long, dramatic evolution for Swift's political identity -- not unlike the trajectory of her music career. Here, in a mature phase, she seems more poised, comfortable, and confident than ever, perfectly willing to use her platform as she likes. It may not tip the scales in a Trump-Harris showdown, but for the many people who feel a close connection to Swift, her words will resonate regardless. Early 2025: Super Bowl LIX There was a lot of build-up to both Trump and Swift's attendance at Super Bowl LIX where the Kansas City Chiefs faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles. When Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce was asked his opinion on Trump attending, his response ran right down the center, to the dismay of Swift's fans who have been critical of Trump's comments on the star. The actual game led to a surprising moment: when Swift and Ice Spice were shown on the jumbotron, the crowd booed. Of course, Trump jumped on the opportunity to troll the pop star. He posted side-by-side videos of them attending, highlighting the negative reaction to Swift's presence. He even reposted Libs of TikTok, who shared the videos and said \"The world is healing!\" This story was updated 4/22/24 @ 12:17 p.m. ET with some reactions to The Tortured Poets Department . This story was updated 9/11/24 @ 7:05 p.m. ET with details of Swift's political activity during the 2024 election and the far right's reactions. This story was updated 2/12/25 @ 4:11 p.m. ET with details from both Trump and Swift's appearances at Super Bowl LIX.\n"

      "A recent executive order has sparked widespread concern about the availability of medications treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition that affects more than 22 million Americans . Titled \" Establishing the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission ,\" the executive order has Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s fingerprints all over it, focusing on several of the pillars of his MAHA campaign, from increasing Americans' life expectancy to fighting chronic illness. But the recent wave of anxiety about ADHD medications largely stems from a line in the executive order calling on the soon-to-be-formed MAHA Commission to produce a report on children's health \"assess[ing] the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\" Stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin are commonly used to treat ADHD in adults and children, along with behavioral treatment . This attack on ADHD medication comes more than two years into a nationwide Adderall shortage , which has already made accessing the medication especially difficult. The language used in the executive order was an immediate red flag for Max Wiznitzer, MD, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland and co-chair of the Professional Advisory Board at CHADD (Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder). \"When they use the word 'threat,' it automatically implies there's something wrong with this treatment, and ignores the mounds of scientific evidence about the utility of the use of medication in conjunction with a multi-modal approach towards target management of ADHD,\" he tells Rolling Stone . Positioning ADHD medications as a \"threat\" is in line with some of Kennedy's previous remarks about the treatment in the context of his plan for \" wellness farms ,\" where \"addicts\" taking illegal and legal drugs -- including Adderall -- could grow and eat organic food, learn a trade, and \"learn to get re-parented.\" So, do parents of children with ADHD and adults with the condition need to worry? Does Kennedy actually have the power to take away or restrict access to people's medications? Rolling Stone spoke with medical and legal experts to find out what Kennedy does -- and doesn't -- have the authority to do, and why this messaging on ADHD medications from the federal government is both stigmatizing and dangerous. The MAHA Commission executive order focuses on the use of stimulants to treat children with ADHD. It begins by claiming that the \"health burdens\" of chronic conditions in children -- including allergies, asthma, and fatty liver disease -- \"have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication.\" The example provided is ADHD -- specifically, that 3.4 million children are currently on medication for the condition. That figure comes from a 2024 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study , which also indicates that the 3.4 million children ages three to 17 who are taking medication for ADHD represent 53.6 percent of the kids with the diagnosis. Later, the executive order stipulates that the MAHA Commission -- with Kennedy at the helm -- has 100 days to submit a report assessing \"the prevalence of and threat\" posed by stimulants used to treat ADHD, as well as other mental health medications, including mood stabilizers and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). \"For now, the White House is only calling for an assessment of how these drugs are being administered and their impact on patients,\" says Ana Santos Rutschman , a professor of law at Villanova University specializing in FDA law and policy, noting that the commission's findings won't be legally binding. In other words, the executive order \"does not and cannot make a change in law, nor a change in the FDA's approval of any medications,\" says Elizabeth Y. McCuskey , professor of health law policy and management at Boston University. \"Congress has set the procedures for that.\" The dangerous part of this executive order, Wiznitzer says, is that there's a good chance that this report will be based on opinion, inaccurate facts, and preconceived notions rather than science. \"When using the term 'threat' [in relation to ADHD medications], there's a concern that they're not going to be looking at this in an objective manner, but they've got a preset agenda that is to be addressed -- and that's not the scientific method,\" he says. \"The scientific method is asking a question in an unbiased manner and then investigating that question in order to come up with an answer.\" This is problematic because the commission's report(s) \"will almost certainly be the policy basis for a couple of agencies to then take steps to make changes,\" Rutschman tells Rolling Stone . Plus, even if experts with appropriate training and expertise are appointed to the MAHA Commision, Kennedy's still the one in charge. \"Putting a secretary with zero epidemiological, medical, or scientific training or professional expertise in charge of studying and interpreting mountains of data is a cause for concern in itself,\" McCuskey says. And if Kennedy were to say that ADHD medications aren't medically necessary, that could create a conflict between the federal government and medical professionals and \"make it a more chaotic environment for patients,\" says Richard Pan, MD , a pediatrician who prescribes ADHD medications and former Democratic state lawmaker . Banning or restricting access to any medication currently used in the treatment of ADHD would have to involve the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which falls under and follows the policies of the Kennedy-led Department of Health and Human Services, Rutschman says. \"These ADHD drugs have been approved by the FDA -- which by law has to make a determination that a drug is safe and effective before a company can sell it,\" she says. \"Also by law, the FDA can withdraw approval or restrict distribution if new evidence suggests that an approved drug is not safe or effective.\" So, banning or restricting access to these drugs would require some sort of FDA-initiated decision based on data raising concerns about a specific ADHD drug. According to Rutschman, the MAHA Commission report itself wouldn't be a sufficient source of this data; rather, it would need to come from several studies reflecting the current \"scientific consensus\" demonstrating that a specific ADHD drug was causing issues, or was not effective. \"If the FDA makes a decision that does not reflect that consensus, then the decision could be challenged in court,\" she says. Plus, as McCuskey points out, the FDA has to go through review processes and consider evidence before revoking the approval of a drug or imposing stricter prescribing or dispensing requirements. Separately, the FDA can impose extra hoops to jump through or conditions for dispensing approved drugs, McCuskey says. One example of this is when the FDA established -- and later removed -- a restriction on the abortion medication mifepristone , requiring patients to take the pill inside the doctor's office. But Kennedy can't simply order the FDA to implement restrictions on ADHD medications: The FDA still has to go through the processes and produce the required justifications for these restrictions that Congress has defined. \"The secretary absolutely can and certainly does influence FDA's conduct and what it investigates, but he cannot dictate it,\" McCuskey says. \"There is cause for concern, but the administrative processes put in place by Congress and challengeable in court are designed to pump the brakes a bit on what any one political appointee can do to an approved drug.\" Even if nothing comes from the executive order, the fact that it's based on unfounded opinion rather than scientific fact is damaging in itself. \"When executive orders are vague and not grounded in science, there's a real disservice, because it's undermining things that have been established to be true: like that ADHD exists, has profound impact on individuals, communities, countries, and their performance, [and] that it's very treatable,\" says Craig Surman, MD , director of the clinical and research program in adult ADHD at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Along the same lines, Surman's concern is that people have access to reliable sources of scientific medical information so they can make informed decisions about their health and their children's health. \"I think it's particularly concerning to be sowing any kind of distrust or confusion when there's already quite a hurdle to clear for people to get good information,\" he tells Rolling Stone . \"There's lots of misinformation about ADHD on TikTok, for example, and I would hope that the government can support entities that are conveying scientific information, because otherwise it's all just guesswork and storytelling, and people don't have access to treatments they need.\" Suggesting ADHD medication is a \"threat\" also casts a negative light on a treatment that for many has been life-changing. \"For someone to stigmatize the medication after we've had all this positive feedback and these years and years and years of research showing us the benefits of what these medications can do for people, I think, is really to ignore the science,\" Wiznitzer says. Casting doubt on the effectiveness of ADHD medication also does a disservice to people living with developmental disabilities, who may not be able to learn how to successfully manage the condition without medication, he adds. Should access to stimulants be restricted, Surman is concerned that adults prescribed ADHD medications could begin self-medicating with alcohol, other substances, or \"street\" Adderall, which may be fake and contain fentanyl . \"Having an FDA-sanctioned way for people to continue to function is pretty important,\" he says. So, what does this all mean for people living with ADHD? \"Right now, I'd say don't panic,\" Pan says. \"And hoarding medication probably is not going to be very productive. It's unlikely that suddenly the medication is not approved, or that your health plan will say, 'Oh, by the way, we're not covering your ADHD medicine.'\" Even so, Wiznitzer says that it's important to consider the impact that stigmatizing ADHD medication could have on the 22 million Americans living with the condition, as well as their families and society as a whole. \"We know what happens when you don't manage ADHD appropriately,\" he says. \"Productivity is down, there's a greater risk for a negative impact on one's health, a shortened life expectancy, increased suicide rate, and an increased chance of risk-taking behaviors, including substance use. Those are things that are not acknowledged by that executive order.\"\n"

      "President-elect Donald Trump has always used his public press conferences and social media posts to seize attention and dictate the terms of national discourse. But his recent trolling about taking over Canada , acquiring Greenland , and reclaiming the Panama Canal reveals something more complex than rhetoric. These statements, far from harmless social media clickbait, show Trump's vision for America: a return to the outdated ambitions of domination from the Bush era. For a man who once styled himself as the \" pro-peace \" candidate, these nation expansion fantasies mark a disturbing pivot toward policies that could destabilize the global order. Now that Trump is president-elect, he has quickly shifted away from the isolationist \" America First \" narrative he promoted during his 2016, 2020, and 2024 campaigns. He painted himself as the voice of the forgotten America who would prioritize domestic concerns over costly foreign entanglements. Trump promised to bring jobs back to the abandoned steel mills of Pennsylvania and Ohio, which had been left to rot by elites from both political parties. This betrayal is particularly glaring when viewed through the lens of his base's priorities. Many of Trump's supporters backed him because they believed he would end endless wars and lower costs. Instead, he's flirting with empire-building, spending billions of tax dollars outside of the United States, and reigniting the neo-conservative ambitions that characterized the George W. Bush era. For years, Trump criticized the Iraq War and described the foreign policy strategy of the Bush administration as disastrous mistakes. However, he now seems to be adopting a vision of America that resembles that of Bush and Dick Cheney: a view of the United States as a dominant force in the hemisphere, free from the constraints of international diplomacy. Trump's rhetoric echoes some of the darkest chapters in American history. The notion of seizing Canada and Greenland conjures memories of 19th-century Manifest Destiny , a doctrine that justified territorial conquest under the guise of spreading democracy and civilization. Similarly, reclaiming the Panama Canal harkens back to the early 20th century, when the United States asserted its dominance in Central America through military interventions and economic coercion. These historical episodes were not just morally fraught; they left a legacy of resentment and instability that continues to shape perceptions of American power across the globe today. By invoking these imperial ambitions, Trump is tapping into a dangerous nostalgia for a bygone era of unchallenged American dominance. But in a world increasingly defined by multipolarity, such fantasies are delusional and counterproductive. Attempting to reclaim a past rooted in conquest and exploitation would not only alienate key allies but also embolden rival powers like China and Russia, who are eager to portray the United States as a destabilizing force. They would weaponize this rhetoric to undermine America's credibility, using it as proof that the U.S. is stuck in an outdated mindset of domination and imperialism. This would make it easier for them to sway other nations into their orbit, framing themselves as the better partners for trade and security. By pursuing these fantasies, America would risk weakening alliances and giving its rivals a chance to expand their influence at our expense, all while creating more instability in regions we can't afford to ignore. Some defenders of Trump's willingness to take Greenland argue that its acquisition would bolster national security and provide economic benefits, given the territory's strategic Arctic location and untapped natural resources . They point to Greenland's position along emerging Arctic shipping routes, which are becoming more navigable due to climate change, and its potential for mineral wealth, including rare earth elements critical for modern technology. Proponents also argue that controlling Greenland would enhance America's ability to counter Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic, framing it as a preemptive move to maintain dominance in the region. But this argument ignores the realities of geopolitics and history. America's ability to project power in the Arctic does not hinge on owning Greenland, and efforts to militarize the region could provoke precisely the kind of tensions with Russia and China that proponents claim to be countering. Simply put, these fantasies of acquiring Greenland would likely cost far more -- in resources, reputation, and stability -- than they could ever deliver. Moreover, Denmark, which oversees Greenland, has explicitly stated that the territory is not for sale. When such a deal is rejected -- as it surely would be -- what comes next? Trump is known for not backing down from a deal and likes to win at all costs. History offers a grim answer: the path from failed negotiations to military intervention is well-trodden. Empire-building rarely unfolds without conflict. Perhaps most concerning is the way Trump's Bush-era rhetoric undermines America's reputation as a champion of diplomacy and international cooperation. If the United States is seen as a rogue state bent on territorial expansion, it risks losing the trust of its allies and the moral high ground it claims to hold. Canada, one of America's closest partners, would undoubtedly view such rhetoric as a betrayal of the mutual respect that underpins their relationship. Similarly, European allies, already wary of Trump's disdain for NATO, would see this as further evidence of his unfitness to lead on the world stage. The implications of Trump's rhetoric extend far beyond damaged relationships with allies. By reigniting the specter of American imperialism, he risks fueling tensions in already volatile regions. Greenland, a territory of Denmark, has strategic importance in the Arctic, a region where competition between the U.S., Russia, and China is intensifying. Any attempt to assert control over Greenland would almost certainly provoke a backlash from these rival powers, increasing the likelihood of conflict. Similarly, talk of reclaiming the Panama Canal could destabilize relations with Latin America, a region where U.S. interventionism has already sown deep distrust. The canal is not just a strategic asset; it's a symbol of Panamanian sovereignty. Any move to retake it would not only violate international norms but also galvanize anti-American sentiment across the hemisphere. As Trump's imperial ambitions come into sharper focus, it's imperative that Americans reject this dystopian vision of the future. The United States does not need to expand its borders or reclaim past glories to remain a global leader. What it needs is a renewed commitment to investing here at home, cooperation, and the principles of self-determination that have long underpinned its foreign policy. Rejecting Trump's rhetoric is not just a matter of opposing one man's dangerous ideas; it's about preserving the values that define America's role in the world. Territorial expansion and imperial dominance are relics of a bygone George Bush era. The voters already rejected this in 2008.\n",

      "Gender expression can come in many forms, but for a kid I'll call Sarah, it first came in the form of a pair of owl pajamas. They were soft cotton, with wide-eyed owls cavorting on a pink background, and at 18 months old, Sarah would wriggle her way out of her \"boy\" clothes and into the pajamas as soon as she got home from preschool, toddling back into the living room pleased as punch with herself. \"She was so, so determined,\" says Sarah's parent Ingrid (who has asked in this article to go by her middle name). \"Like, 'No, this is actually what I want.'\" At age two, Sarah came across a rack of dresses hanging outside a store and tried to put one on right there on the sidewalk (\"You look beautiful,\" an older woman said in passing, to Ingrid's relief). At three, according to Ingrid, Sarah began to \"socially transition herself,\" asking to grow her hair out, gravitating in the aisles of Target toward sparkly dresses in hues of Pepto-Bismol pink and to anything having to do with unicorns. In kindergarten, Sarah said she wanted to change her pronouns. In first grade, she said she wanted to change her name. Somewhere along the way, her parents went to see some specialists to ask for advice on how to handle what was clearly not just a phase: \"We were like, 'Well, this thing seems to be a thing . What do we do to not mess her up?' And they were like, 'Just give her space, make sure she's safe, and let her lead.' And so that's what we've [done].\" They also began to join listservs for the families of transgender children, tapping into a network of fellow New York City parents who had experience navigating some of the parenting concerns specific to raising a trans child. There were meetups and playdates and support groups. There was also information about medical providers and timelines. It was understood that not every trans child would want or require medical care -- especially when it comes to a generation of children that, more than previous generations, understand gender to be both a spectrum and a construct. But it was also understood that trans kids were significantly more likely than their cisgender peers to die by suicide. A national 2022 study conducted by the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention, found that more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth seriously considered suicide in that year alone. Another study , published this past September in the journal Nature Human Behavior , linked those rates not to something inherent in trans identity but instead to trans acceptance in the broader culture: In states that passed anti-trans legislation, including bans on gender-affirming care, suicide attempts by transgender teenagers could increase by as much as 72 percent in the years after the ban went into effect. It stood to reason that for children who experience gender dysphoria, or distress over the disconnect between their biological sex and their gender identity, even offering them possibility of not having to grow into an unwelcome body could buttress their mental health. Sarah's parents had noticed that each step she took in transitioning seemed to calm her, to make her more \"settled,\" as Ingrid puts it. As Sarah approached the age of puberty, they began to carefully broach the subject of what she could expect. \"I mean, who wants to talk about puberty with their parents?\" asks Ingrid. \"We were just like, 'You're going to enter this thing called puberty pretty soon. Right now, your puberty will have you end up in a boy body, but there's these different options. If you want to, we can pause it until you figure out if you want a girl body or a boy body.'\" Sarah was adamant that she already knew: She was not a boy; she did not want to end up in a boy body. Her parents booked an informational appointment with the Transgender Youth Health Program at NYU Langone's children's hospital, one of the world's most well-regarded gender-affirming-care practices at one of the world's premier medical institutions. That was about a year ago. This past November, after Sarah turned nine, bloodwork came back confirming what her parents already suspected: Her body was \"establishing puberty,\" which meant that it was the ideal time to begin puberty-blocker treatment -- before irreversible physiological changes had become too apparent but not so early that it would be impossible to determine how the influx of puberty hormones might affect Sarah's gender dysphoria. In her case, the beginning of puberty did nothing to lessen her gender dysphoria; it only threatened to make it worse, which was to be expected. While it is not entirely impossible that gender dysphoria could dissipate at the onset of puberty, the idea that children frequently \"detransition\" -- or grow out of their gender dysphoria -- is a popular anti-trans talking point that the data does not bear out. A 2022 study in Pediatrics found that 94 percent of children who had socially transitioned still identified as transgender five years afterward; a further 3.5 percent identified as nonbinary. After the bloodwork came back, Sarah's doctors ordered a bone scan to confirm the health of her bones (research suggests that puberty blockers can cause a reduction in bone density, especially if taken for a long time, so their use may not be suggested for children with brittle bones). They ordered a scan of her left hand, to check her growth plates. Ingrid says that a psychiatrist who specializes in gender issues, and who Sarah had been seeing for years, prepared a so-called readiness letter, confirming that Sarah met the qualifications for gender dysphoria: She had distress relating to a gender identity that differed from the sex she had been assigned at birth and that distress had lasted six months or longer -- in Sarah's case, it had lasted for years. \"And then they have a seven-page consent that you go over with your kid,\" explains Ingrid. \"We went through it line by line with Sarah, made sure she understood it. Kids can only hear so much at a time, so when we had a spare moment -- like walking to the bus or whatever -- we'd be like, 'Oh, let's look at what questions you have.'\" Puberty-blocker medications can be administered via an implant, which lasts one year, or a series of shots. Because of her fear of needles, Sarah opted for the implant, which insurance companies classify as a \"surgical\" procedure, though it is not invasive and can be done in-office with local anesthesia. On Jan. 12, Sarah had an appointment in which her doctor walked her through what she could expect: A tiny incision would be made in her upper arm; an implant the size of the tip of a pencil's lead would be inserted, releasing the puberty blocker Supprelin LA; the incision would be closed by a single stitch. The next available appointment was on Friday, Jan. 31. Sarah took it. On Tuesday, Jan. 28 -- after the Trump administration issued an executive order referring to gender-affirming care as \"the chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" ordering the removal of federal funding from institutions that continue to provide gender-affirming care, and directing the Department of Justice to explore whether a federal law against female genital mutilation for minors could be applied to those who provide the care -- Ingrid says she reached out to NYU to confirm that Sarah's procedure was still scheduled and would still be covered by insurance. She was assured that, on both counts, it was. Then, at 4:06 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 29, she received another call from NYU. \"It was a nurse from pediatric surgery. I thought it was going to be like, 'Oh, don't drink water after midnight,' right?\" says Ingrid. \"Instead, it was someone from operations calling to say that because of the executive order, they're quote-unquote pausing all treatment at this time. So, they canceled the appointment.\" WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMOUNT of political attention a subject is given and the number of people those attentions target, it's hard to imagine an issue as profoundly lopsided as gender-affirming care. While it is estimated that roughly one percent of the population is transgender, a 2025 peer-reviewed research analysis conducted by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health -- which was published in JAMA Pediatrics and which analyzed a database of private insurance claims from 2018 to 2022 that included more than 5 million American adolescents -- found that less than 0.1 percent of minors with private insurance receive puberty blockers or hormone treatment for gender dysphoria. Despite what right-wing dog whistles would have one believe, irreversible procedures like top surgery are performed on individuals under the age of 18 in only the rarest of cases. The Harvard study, for instance, found the rate to be 2.1 procedures per 100,000 teens between the ages of 15 and 17 (no surgeries were performed on children younger than 15), meaning that less than 300 of such surgeries are performed each year for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. (For reference, 23,527 individuals age 19 or younger had surgical cosmetic procedures like nose jobs and breast implants in 2022 alone.) Puberty blockers -- which have been used since the early 1980s to treat kids with early-onset puberty and since the 1990s to treat kids with gender dysphoria -- have minor medical risks, like many other medications given to children without fanfare or undo concern. They are essentially a pause button: They will not reverse physical changes that have already taken place, but they can buy a child extra time to explore their gender identity, which, studies have shown , continues to develop even while a child is on them. They are considered reversible because once a child stops receiving them, fertility development is restored and natal puberty resumes as usual (unless the child begins taking gender-affirming hormones, which cannot be prescribed without parental permission); yet there can be permanent, if slight, effects when it comes to bone development, which relies on the release of the hormones. Because of that, children are not supposed to stay on them for more than a few years, and, as in Sarah's case, their bone health is monitored. Some recent studies of puberty blockers have failed to replicate the improvement in mental health that other studies have demonstrated, leading to calls for further longitudinal research. Yet the strength of the data in their favor is such that they continue to be the standard of care supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Psychological Association, among many other nonpartisan organizations of repute. \"The only statistic that anyone knows for sure -- and that matters -- is that a scarily high percentage of trans kids who aren't supported fucking kill themselves,\" one mom of a trans child tells me pointedly, of weighing the potential pros and cons of gender-affirming care. Which is why Ingrid went into panic mode the afternoon she received the news that Sarah's appointment had been canceled at NYU: \"First, I was totally shocked, and then I was frustrated, and then I was scared, and then I was furious.\" The following morning, she reached out to Mount Sinai, having heard through the parent network that that hospital was still accepting new patients. \"We were like, 'We'll take any appointment you will give us,'\" Ingrid explains. They were able to schedule an appointment for that coming Monday. \"Then Friday at 5:30, someone calls me, and I'm like, 'You're calling to cancel the appointment, aren't you?'\" Ingrid says. \"And she was like, 'Well, I'm not canceling it, but what I'm telling you is that we are not taking on any new patients to give them any sort of medical or pharmaceutical interventions.'\" According to Ingrid, the Mount Sinai representative offered instead to refer Sarah to a psychologist. Ingrid was floored. \"I was like, '[Sarah] doesn't need to see a psychologist. She has a psychologist. She needs actual medical care for a diagnosis.'\" Possibly the worst part of all for Ingrid was figuring out how to break the news to Sarah that the procedure she had been anticipating would not, in fact, be happening for the foreseeable future. \"I mean, it was really hard as a parent to figure out what to say, because she's very smart and precocious, but she's also only nine and a half. You don't want to saddle her with all of the hate,\" Ingrid says. Unsure what Sarah might hear at school the next day, Ingrid sat on the edge of Sarah's bed and broached the subject cautiously, explaining what was going on in the broadest of strokes and reassuring her that they would do whatever they could to get her the care she needed. Sarah seemed to take the information in stride. But for Ingrid, it was proof that, despite her best efforts, the careful bubble of acceptance she'd created for her child was in the process of being burst. \"She's in a school that's very affirming. We've been able to build a community that's very affirming,\" Ingrid says. \"It's like, how do you tell your kid that they can't get needed medical care because people don't think that they should exist -- when they're the proof in front of you that this is what they need to thrive and grow?\" ACROSS AMERICA, 674 anti-trans bills were proposed at all levels of government in 2024, the fifth consecutive year that saw a rise in the amount of proposed legislation targeting trans people. Close to 200 of those bills sought to prohibit or outlaw gender-affirming care, and 11 such bills passed, including New Hampshire's HB619 (which not only banned gender-affirming care for minors but also prohibited medical professionals from referring patients who sought such care out of state) and Wyoming's SF0099 (which would revoke the medical license of anyone found to be providing such care). To date, anti-trans health care bills have passed in 26 states. But 2024 also saw the continuation of a trend: the increasing push to pass anti-trans legislation federally. A record-breaking 87 anti-trans laws were considered at the national level last year, many of which took their cues (and language) from state-level laws that took their cues (and language) from boilerplate provided by right-wing, anti-trans groups like the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, which, despite its legit-sounding name, is not a recognized medical organization and which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group and referred to as a \"hub of pseudoscience.\" In fact, one piece of evidence that the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine is not in fact \"evidence-based\" is its promotion of the idea of \"rapid-onset gender dysphoria,\" a debunked theory that trans-ness is a \"social contagion\" and can come on unexpectedly in late adolescence (the theory has been debunked, in part, because it was originally derived from a survey of parents recruited from anti-trans websites ). That \"rapid-onset gender dysphoria\" is name-checked in Trump's executive order is the proof no one really needed that the pseudoscience and lack of scientific rigor that has undergirded state legislation is now to be promoted from the top down. \"Rapid-onset gender dysphoria is not real. That does not exist,\" says Sydney Duncan, who is senior counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Advocates for Trans Equality and who represented amicus clients in United States v. Skrmetti , a case challenging Tennessee's bans on gender-affirming care for minors that is currently before the Supreme Court. \"It is junk science, the absolute definition of junk science, the Pizzagate of science, and it's right there in black and white in this executive order being offered as something that's a basis for bringing this kind of action against the trans community.\" The lack of scientific rigor has nevertheless not stopped the order from having a chilling effect on some hospital administrations in states that have long been safe havens for gender-affirming care. \"Many of these institutions rely on federal funding simply to keep their doors open,\" says Alex Sheldon, the executive director of GLMA, an organization of health professionals who advocate for LGBTQ+ equality in the health care field. \"We're talking about, in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars to individual institutions. We're talking about funding that allows for them to care for all children, not just trans and nonbinary children. It is a scary prospect to close down a gigantic hospital system simply because you provided care to one population -- and that is a fear that we can, frankly, understand and empathize with.\" Yet if the executive order has put hospital systems in a terrible bind, the restrictions some of those systems have put in place have forced their physicians into an impossible situation as well, one in which they are forced to choose between obeying the new regulations and abiding by the Hippocratic Oath. \"The providers I've spoken to are experiencing immense moral injury,\" continues Sheldon. \"I know providers who have had to cancel appointments, and in doing so, have received messages from those patients and families saying that they will be to blame for the patient's suicide. Just like how we are asking elementary school teachers to be armed guards, we're now asking providers to be legal professionals in a changing legal environment. They do not know how to keep up, and they shouldn't have to.\" There's also the fear -- among families and providers alike -- that a window that had been getting smaller might be closing entirely. Though Trump's executive order is neither enforceable nor legal -- in fact, New York Attorney General Letitia James almost immediately responded with an order for hospitals in the state to resume care or be in violation of anti-discrimination laws -- the clear proof that care could be affected or paused even in blue states like New York points to the prospect of a national ban. \"I thought this was a safe space, and I feel stupid for thinking that,\" one parent of a New York trans kid tearfully told me, explaining how her child had recently asked if he could get his puberty-blocker implant early, in anticipation of a time when he wouldn't be able to get it at all. On Feb. 4, when lawyers from LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal and the ACLU announced that they were pursuing a legal challenge to the executive order, they shared that one of their plaintiffs was a 17-year-old whose family had moved from Tennessee to Virginia to access gender-affirming care, only to have her appointment in Virginia canceled the day after the order came out. At a certain point, a child simply runs out of time. \"There really isn't room for error,\" says Del Sasso, a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating trans children. \"The analogy I've been making is if you said to a family, 'You know, your child's chemotherapy that's keeping their cancer at bay? They'll be able to get it again. We just have to pause and get our ducks in a row.' No one would accept that. That's not a risk that's acceptable.\" It's especially not acceptable for Sasso, who has seen firsthand the devastation that can come from denying or delaying care. \"Just having an appointment scheduled for gender-affirming care can be lifesaving for some of these kids,\" they tell me. \"Many of them are barely hanging on, and the thing that's keeping them going is knowing that they're gonna get this care.\" In fact, Sasso points out, studies have shown that policies that promote the mental health of trans kids, like having access to gender-affirming care and having gay-straight alliances in schools, can promote the mental health of all kids. \"Having your peers commit suicide is not good for anyone's mental health,\" Sasso says plainly. \"Knowing that your peers are frightened, that they may have to talk to Child Protective Services, that they're afraid of being in school and having their teacher forced to misgender [them] -- and then the teacher is uncomfortable, the kids are uncomfortable, the child who's experiencing gender dysphoria is uncomfortable -- these are awful situations that impact communities. It's really shortsighted to think that it's only affecting that child or their family.\" Until Congress passes a national ban, Duncan has faith that the executive order will not prevail in court (although, she adds, \"One of the problems with these executive orders is that they're so incompetent that it's hard to understand what's [legally] actionable and what's not actionable\"). Two federal judges have already blocked the order, and there is some evidence that hospitals that paused care have since resumed some procedures (NYU Langone and Mount Sinai both declined to comment). Yet all concerned parties agree that the very fact of the executive order's existence is damaging enough to the well-being of trans kids and those who love them, that it continues to scapegoat a vulnerable population -- and that its existence should concern anyone who fears the erosion of civil liberties under this new administration. \"Fifty percent of Americans out there are dialing into these media organizations and these executive orders and these state policies, and they're seeing over and over and over again vilification of trans existence,\" Duncan says. \"That has a cultural consequence.\" That cultural consequence is certainly a concern for Ingrid, who spent much of the week following the executive order calling hospitals up and down the East Coast before she found one that would agree to treat Sarah. (It is a testament to the precarity of the times that she does not want to divulge who the doctor is or where they practice for fear that they will face retribution, though she did share that \"the doctor said she'll stop caring for these kids over her jailed body, which is the energy I need.\") \"These executive orders are using the force of our government to discriminate against a tiny minority of kids,\" she tells me. \"My kid is left bewildered and wondering what she did to deserve all this hate. I'm left wondering how to protect her.\"\n"

      "Something -- someone -- was in the air on Nov. 6. It was unseasonably hot, 78 degrees in Manhattan and the air was heavy, the life of the city and its people drained. If you didn't know about the election, you might've guessed that someone had died. You wouldn't be too far off. At my all-girls high school, the atmosphere was apocalyptic. Everyone, students and teachers alike, was at a collective loss for words. An 11th grade homeroom teacher stood in front of a room of nearly sixty 16- and 17-year-old girls and confessed he didn't know what to say. A brown-haired girl near the front cried silent tears. What was most disturbing was the dejection of it all. Gone was the anger, the fury of injustice, that had been the hallmark of the last two years. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, the halls had been filled with outrage. Now, there was nothing but grief for what could have been and bone-deep despair about what was to come. In the days since the election, I have read articles upon articles dissecting and examining from every which way what went wrong with the Democrats. They didn't have a primary. They put forth a Black woman. They didn't connect with the working class. Their signature mantra of Donald Trump 's threat to democracy seemed far-fetched and flimsy in comparison to the higher cost-of-living voters faced. The party was stuck -- unable to address the deep-seated malaise plaguing the nation while simultaneously consolidating a viable coalition against Trumpism. While the Democrats were hemmed in, the Trump campaign thrived, doubling down on a radical and populist message that promised, if nothing else, change. Only one party on the ticket attacked the status quo, and it was not the Democrats. In the end, Kamala Harris ran on hope, and the majority of voters didn't want it. The electorate was angry and wanted retribution, which, luckily for them, is exactly what Donald Trump is all about. In the days since the election, it has all soured in retrospect. The Democrats' historic campaign of joy has started to feel like one big folly. But we must not forget what those who supported it fought for, and what we will continue to fight for: morality, justice, liberty, human rights for all -- for girls like the ones at my school, for those seeking better lives, and even for those who rebuked us, those who voted against us. The election was a loss, but we must remember that it is not the end. Next year, those who misguidedly chose Trump's touted tax cuts and tariffs over integrity and civil liberties are going to realize what the Democrats were warning of, and they are not going to like it. Trump's return to office is going to be a reckoning for the American people, and there are treacherous times ahead. In his victory speech, Trump reminded us that throughout this election cycle, and over the past eight years, he has made it very clear what he is going to do in office. \"Promises made, promises kept,\" he vowed. \"We're going to keep our promises.\" Well, Democrats -- let's keep ours. Young people like myself are counting on it. And to any young person reading this: With a climate change-denier as our president-elect, as the soon-to-be leader of the free world, our futures are less guaranteed than ever. We cannot afford the luxury of waiting until we are adults to act. The time is now. Stay informed and engaged. Get involved. Make noise at rallies. Scream when Trump does everything in his power to keep you silent. Prepare to run for office. I'm a junior in high school. I was unable to vote this year. But I phone-banked and volunteered with Democrat John Avlon, who ran for New York 's first congressional district. We thought we were going to win -- but we lost badly. Yet now is not the time to lay down our arms. We must work even harder during the off years. And when national politics seems like a lost cause, we must turn to the local arena. Work from the bottom up. The ground is shifting under us. But when we can no longer trust the ground beneath us, we must turn to each other. This country has seen some of the darkest times, and yet in all of America's 248 years, she has always had one thing: people who fight for what is right. As Harris said in her concession speech, \"Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.\" We are the stars. We must keep fighting.\n",

      "\"Cute winter boots.\" \"Where to find cute winter boots.\" \"Have you seen my cute winter boots?\" In the weeks following Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office, the phrase has dominated many For You pages on TikTok . But the expression isn't about creators shopping for lace-up or nonslip footwear options online. It's a new algorithm-based code word that TikTokers are using to avoid alleged censorship and shadowbanning on the app -- and it's proving the limits of what online awareness-as- activism can really accomplish. Trump's return to office has come with numerous executive orders attacking immigration, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in the U.S., a tactic that has kept social media platforms absolutely flooded with misinformation on all sides. But combined with the ongoing attempt to keep TikTok active in the U.S. -- and Trump's public statements that he'll save the app as long as a U.S.-based company buys at least 50 percent -- there's been a wave of concern online that TikTok's acceptance of Trump's help means the app is actively suppressing anti-Trump videos. (TikTok did not respond to Rolling Stone 's request for comment.) That's how the cute winter boots trend was born. Early iterations referred to heightened concern regarding increased ICE raids in the U.S. (because winter boots keep you from slipping on ice). At first, the phrase meant watch out for immigration officers at a specific location, then it meant take a stand against Trump-era immigration policies, and then it meant keep an eye out for fascism. Now it's a dog whistle meant to attract like-minded liberal posters on TikTok. As Vox's Rebecca Jennings recently wrote , there's been an \"erosion of trust\" between social media users and platform owners like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg -- one that makes people suspicious of platforms even when their owners say they're not suppressing content. But as the cute winter boots trend continues to evolve, and get away from its original context to something far more nebulous, internet experts and researchers tell Rolling Stone they're doubtful any algorithmically supported trend that is purposefully vague can make any meaningful difference at a time when information is more than just helpful -- it's necessary. Sara August, a 23-year-old Amazon driver from Florida, considers the cute winter boot trend a necessary way to get information to TikTok users. She's posted at least two \"cute winter boots\" videos, both of which use handwritten messages to warn her 500,000 followers to look up proposed bills targeting the U.S.'s immigrant population. She tells Rolling Stone she started using the video format because her Tik Toks criticizing Trump would only get views in the four-digits, when she usually hit at least 10,000 on her lowest performing posts. \"The main thing for me is to get people informed and pressure them to do their own research,\" she says. \"There is always going to be a faction of people that say it's performative. I'm not trying to profit off of [my video.] So many people are denying things, and if I can get the information out this way, at least people know enough to look it up.\" But August's videos aren't the norm. In fact, they're some of the only ones out there with a real call to action behind them. Since the phrase was first posted around Jan. 23, the hashtag has been used on 37,000 videos on TikTok, not including the thousands of videos using the expression either on screen or in various contexts. People first used it to post warnings on TikTok of ICE raids conducted in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. On Sunday, Jan. 26, officials confirmed at least 956 people had been arrested in the crackdowns, with less than half having criminal records. Over the next few days, cute winter boots represented a warning about the Trump administration's plans to conduct new raids in more cities over the coming weeks. Then it devolved into a concern over ICE in general, or Trump's executive orders. That morphed into concern about Musk and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew's relationship with Trump leading to outright suppression. Now, video can range from combining all of the above concerns to none at all. People went on long diatribes about shopping for boots while holding up hand written signs telling people their for-you-pages were being heavily censored or monitored. Others capitalized certain letters of their comments, spelling out \"Deny. Defend. Depose,\" a rallying cry popularized following the arrest of Luigi Mangione , who is suspected of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson . And hundreds posted videos about cute winter boots with no actual message in them -- only soundtracks from revolutionary pop-culture staples, like The Hunger Games , Cabaret , and Les Miserables . The result has been confusing or downright unparseable videos taking over the small amount of \"cute winter boots\" posts with actually parseable or helpful information. The lack of meaning across the board is one of the things that's concerned Lee Tepper, a 32-year-old therapist from Ohio who regularly posts on TikTok. Tepper, who uses they/them pronouns, says they're worried that people who are posting the cute winter boots trend as activism aren't really tuned into real ways to help offline. \"When we have trends like this, it tends to imply that systems and organizations that have been doing this work for a long time don't [exist],\" Tepper says. \"This cute winter boots phrase isn't directing people necessarily to already existing avenues of community support. The trend is a trend for a reason. People want to participate in advocacy and social change. But at the same time, we can invest in infrastructure that's already there.\" This isn't the first time online communities have attempted to use phrases or code words to organize. It's been more than 10 years since the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri jump-started the #BlackLivesMatter movement, and what began as an underground and decentralized social movement turned into dozens of muted or poorly-thought out demonstrations. In 2020, the #BlackoutTuesday day of silence on Instagram, where supporters were encouraged to post a single black box, clogged relevant hashtags and made it nearly impossible for organizers to share relevant information on protests. \"What we're seeing now is kind of an extension of a general format of activism that has been happening on social media for at least the past decade,\" says Zari Taylor, an assistant professor at New York University who teaches on social media and digital platforms. \"It's similar to the black box situation. Posting about cute winter boots doesn't do anything to help with emergent situations in your area. So the visibility that people are striving for is typical to the culture that we're seeing on social media, but that might not be compatible with long term, impactful, grassroots organizing that I believe can only really happen in person and not online.\" Much of the concern around the cute winter boots trend isn't that it could become dangerous, but rather that TikTok users participating in the trend might think that posting is enough. Hundreds of users have complained that the trend doesn't serve a real purpose, or has gone so far from its intended goal that it's just a way for people to virtue signal -- show their beliefs in a public way online. Christine Tran, a digital culture expert and assistant professor at the University of Toronto posits that the problem isn't the trend itself, it's the incompatibility of today's creator economy with real-life action. \"That's an inherent contradiction of trying to communicate via social media platforms. The horizons of how these platforms are structured encourage [people] to aggregate attention, aggregate time, to jump on to particular trends,\" Tran says. \"I'm taking seriously the earnestness of creators in this moment, who are very much aware of how ownership of these platforms is implicated in a lot of broader problematic political movements. But I don't think developing these specific vernaculars is providing an alternative way out, because all these examples still presuppose that everybody has to be on the platform.\" The cute winter boots trend is the clear end result of platforms that have lost the trust of many of their user base. But it's also highlighting the problems with social media users who equate the very nature of signaling political beliefs as activism. Using the cute winter boots format might be netting people more views on their political content but it's because it's a trending term, not because the phrase itself has flown past the alleged TikTok censorship machine. Posting alone is not an act of resistance. Also, the underlying belief of the trend is that anti-Trump information is simply not being posted or consumed unless it is hidden or shrouded. But that's incredibly difficult to prove. In fact, every American news organization that has a presence on TikTok has remained able to post, comment, and share information across the political spectrum. People should remain wary of platforms that seem like they're soft launching political bias or forms of censorship. But if the goal of censorship is the control and regulation of important information or ideas, then an anti-censorship trend that purposefully obfuscates its own message isn't clever. It's missing the point at a time when real helpful information and action could mean the biggest difference for people outside of For You pages. \"We're dealing with platforms and commercially, their material interests are rather at odds with some of the loftier goals of leftist organizing. You're performing for imagined audiences and algorithms, but people under attack by I.C.E right now don't have to contend with imagined [detractors]. They're contending with police,\" Tran says. \"And I don't know if we can meme our way out of this.\"\n"

      "Faress Arafat, 22, worked as a volunteer nurse in Gaza -- first in the emergency department at al-Shifa Hospital and then in displacement camps in Rafah. It has now been one year since Israel 's war on Gaza began. More than 41,000 people have been killed, and 100,000 have been injured. More than 16,000 children are among the dead. We are haunted by painful memories that are impossible to forget. How could I forget that we left our home and city, seeking refuge in a tent that offered no protection from the heat or cold? How can I forget the scenes of dismembered bodies we saw daily in our work as medical teams, being the first to respond to the injuries? How can I forget the cries of the injured children, their screams echoing inside my mind? How can I forget the sound of women weeping as they said goodbye to their loved ones? There is no way to forget or move on. After leaving Gaza, I realized that everything I experienced while working as a volunteer emergency nurse at al-Shifa Hospital was only the beginning of a painful journey. After my colleagues and I were evacuated from the al-Shifa complex, around 45 days into the war, we moved south to the displacement camps, specifically in Rafah. We were in shock, not caring about anything other than how to manage our daily lives -- fetching drinking water, standing in lines for aid, or volunteering at medical points. Our thoughts were occupied with everything but ourselves. I thought this was a good thing and would help me get over what I had witnessed at al-Shifa, but gradually, after more than 200 days of war, I began to notice clear changes in myself. I became more irritable and withdrawn, avoiding people and social gatherings. I considered leaving Gaza, thinking that perhaps the problem was the constant fear of death and lack of safety. I did leave, taking my family with me to Egypt in search of safety and psychological stability. But, to my misfortune, reality was worse than I imagined. I began to experience daily nightmares -- seeing burnt bodies and dismembered limbs in my sleep. I started seeing water as blood. The sound of civilian airplanes or even cars terrified me, as if a missile was coming to chase and kill me. Even the sound of dogs made me think they were coming to eat me, just as I had seen them eat the corpses in Gaza. These fears followed me everywhere I went. I lost a lot of weight and isolated myself from others. I thought this was the only way to save myself from death. But I was in a safe place -- what could I possibly die from? Fortunately, I realized that I needed psychological treatment to face the world and continue my journey as a nurse. My role was not over yet. Indeed, I started therapy sessions, which began to restore my faith in myself. I later realized that my situation was much better than those of my colleagues who remained in Gaza. One day, I made a video call to my friend Amer, who works as a paramedic in northern Gaza. Amer had never stopped working in the ambulance service, never stopped saving lives, despite facing death several times. Every time I met him, I would tell him that he was strong and that I drew my strength from him. But this time was different. Amer was completely exhausted and broken. When I saw his face, he was very thin and appeared to be suffering from severe anemia due to the famine in northern Gaza. I asked Amer how he was doing and how work was going. He sighed and told me that the Israeli army was now close to the ambulance station where he was stationed and had issued evacuation orders. The situation was terrifying, but he was laughing. I was puzzled -- why was he laughing when he might be on the brink of death? He told me that he had lost all feelings toward life. Every day he saw dozens of decaying and torn bodies being eaten by dogs. Every day he tried to save dozens of injured people and children, but in many cases, he failed. Suddenly, his laughter turned into intense crying. He told me that one day, while trying to save some injured people, he found among the victims his brother, who had suffered severe injuries to his legs and arms. I tried to console him and asked how he managed to sleep and cope with everything that had happened after 300 days of war. He told me that everything had changed. He now suffers from constant fear and trauma -- fear for his family, fear for himself. He can only sleep with the help of sleeping pills, which have become scarce. He has become more tense and depressed all the time, haunted by thoughts of the future, wondering when the war will end and thinking about the injured who are dying slowly due to a lack of resources. He described to me how he feels as if his head is empty, without a brain, being carried away by ghosts. Then he told me he was afraid of dying and becoming food for dogs and cats. At that moment, I felt my tongue grow heavy, and I couldn't say anything except to tell him that he was strong and could endure. I apologized for having to end the call because I was completely unable to console him. After several weeks, I called Amer again to check on him. Unfortunately, this time he was crying bitterly. He told me that his family's house was bombed, his father and only sister were killed, and his mother was seriously injured. She is now in an intensive care unit and may lose all her limbs. Amer is not alone in this state; there are thousands of medical workers who have not stopped working since the beginning of the war. Some have died, lost their entire families, homes, and loved ones. How can this group be brought out of the shock after the war? It won't be easy. Each of us has a sad story, each one different from the other.\n",

      "Donald Trump 's new executive order , titled \"Implementing the President's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) Workforce Optimization Initiative,\" outlines exactly how Trump and Elon Musk plan to dismantle the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and strip transitioning military veterans and their families overseas of the generous federal hiring incentives they rely on. This executive order seeks to impose severe hiring restrictions and would disproportionately harm veterans, who make up one-third of the federal workforce. Requiring agencies to hire only one new employee for every four who leave will drastically reduce VA staffing levels. At a time when the veteran population is aging and the VA's mission has expanded under Joe Biden , this policy will lead to massive delays and outright denials in health care, benefits processing, and disability claims -- the essential services veterans depend on to survive. The order also forces agencies to implement immediate reductions in force, prioritizing cuts to positions not explicitly mandated by law. In practice, this means slashing administrative staff, veteran outreach programs, and transition assistance. Many of these programs help veterans adjust to civilian life, with federal employment serving as a stable career path for thousands. Active-duty military members stationed overseas also rely on these programs for critical support, from child care to helping their spouses secure employment in foreign countries where they may lack language skills or legal work status. What's worse, this executive order makes hiring at VA more bureaucratic and politicized. Each new hire must be approved by a DOGE \"team lead,\" creating unnecessary hurdles in filling critical positions. As we have learned over the past few weeks, these \"team leads\" can be 19-year-old kids who go by names like \"bigballs,\" or 25-year-old men who have recently gone on racist tirades about how we should \"Normalize Indian Hate. \" The VA is already grappling with severe workforce shortages, particularly in medical and benefits processing roles. This new hiring bottleneck guarantees growing backlogs, delayed care, and increased suffering for veterans. But that may be the goal. If Musk and DOGE aim to dismantle the government, they achieve two objectives at once -- denying care to veterans while making the VA so dysfunctional that veterans either forgo medical treatment or are forced into the private sector. For years, politicians have promised to fix the VA and take care of veterans. But this Trump executive order does the opposite -- it throws veterans under the bus and a few other fast moving objects. First, by cutting veteran federal workers who make up a huge part of the workforce; second, by slashing the very services those same veterans need; third, by denying our military service members and their families adequate support overseas and here at home; and finally, doing anything but making sure veterans have a stable place and support system to build a life post-service. Trump couldn't care less about veterans -- he never served and doesn't understand or respect those who do . It's not clear whether Musk has taken an oath to the U.S. Constitution. Neither man can begin to grasp the sacrifices military members and their families make every day to keep Americans safe. Their reward? A callous system run by billionaires who claim to want to slash government spending -- except when it comes to the White House budget or the tens of billions Musk's companies receive from U.S. taxpayers. Right now, Trump and Musk are scrambling to find revenue to fund their mass deportation schemes and extend the trillions in tax cuts Trump passed in 2017, which are set to expire. Those cuts primarily benefited corporations and the wealthiest Americans . Musk and Trump have claimed that he's saving the U.S. government lots of money; no one can give a real number. What we do know is that number is getting smaller as the State Department is poised to spend $400 million to buy \"armored\" Teslas. Like naming a government agency after a crypto meme coin (DOGE), or launching a new crypto meme coin , Musk and Trump are just getting started with their giant grift. As for our veterans and military service members, their message is clear: Good luck, you're on your own. Michael Embrich is a veteran, former member of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans, and former congressional staffer.\n"

      "Six years ago a gunman entered my high school in Parkland, Florida, and shot and killed 17 people and wounded 17 more. At the time, Donald Trump was in the middle of his presidency. Days after he expressed potential support for gun safety laws, the NRA called him up and he reversed himself. No one offered us more than thoughts and prayers. It was up to us, young people, to March For Our Lives . Since then, we've done more than march and accomplished what most thought was impossible. We passed the first federal gun safety law in three decades, created the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and just this summer, the U.S. Surgeon General finally declared gun violence a public health crisis. This is real progress that has translated into real results and lives saved. While gun-related deaths increased by 34 percent under Trump and he bragged about doing \"nothing\", we're now seeing a historic decline in gun violence, with gun deaths down by nearly 20 percent since 2021. Violent crime is also down and the murder rate is on track for its largest annual decline ever. This is not accidental. It was made possible by the tremendous efforts of survivors, activists, and young people, who elected gun violence prevention candidates, held them accountable, and made their voices heard. While I wish I could say our work is finished, guns still remain the number one cause of death for kids and young people. And on November 5th, all of our progress is on the line. Our lives are once again on the line. The country that young people like me will soon inherit stands at the precipice -- on one side, authoritarianism that threatens our freedoms, future, and our right to live freely without gun violence; on the other, a world with opportunity, where we can keep fighting to build the future that we deserve. The stakes couldn't be higher and the contrast couldn't be more clear. This unprecedented moment calls for unprecedented action, which is why March For Our Lives endorsed our first-ever candidate for public office, Vice President Kamala Harris for president of the United States. We have always been ready and willing to work with whoever was ready to fight for our lives. But it's clear that not everyone cares to keep kids alive. Only one candidate has told survivors to \" just get over it \" after a school shooting, and only one candidate is dedicated to treating gun violence like a real emergency. At a time when America faces growing authoritarianism, far-right leaders in the halls of power, and a gun violence epidemic that is ravaging our communities, we need champions up and down the ballot who will fight for our lives. The task ahead is a tall one. It's no secret that young people have been pessimistic this past year. But the script is now flipped. Polling shows a surge in youth voter enthusiasm since Harris took over the ticket, with young people showing up in ways we haven't seen since the first March For Our Lives in 2018. I'm seeing with my own eyes, amongst my own peers, the excitement and renewed hope that young people have for our future. You can see the energy on social media, at campaign events, and even in youth voter registration numbers . And if I know anything, it's that when young people are energized, we don't lose. Since March For Our Lives was founded, we've helped drive youth voter turnout to record highs -- and polling increasingly shows that the 2024 election will be no exception. This is real hope for real change, and it can power a real difference in this election. As President Biden has often said, this election is a battle for the soul of our nation and the future we want to create. Young people have the power to shape this future, and once again, the power to make a difference this election cycle . And we're more motivated than ever to get out and beat back fascism. That's why I'm calling on all young people to join us in this fight. The journey we've embarked on since Parkland has shown us the power of collective action. We've witnessed firsthand how our voices, when united, can bring about meaningful change. It's time to come together one again to make our voices heard and to show that we are a force to be reckoned with. As we look towards November 5th, let's remember the power we hold. Let's remember that our vote can be the difference between going back and moving forward, between fear and hope, between a future dictated by a few and a future shaped by all of us, and a country where none of us are at risk of being shot and where our futures are prioritized. Let's march for our lives once again, this time to the ballot box. David Hogg is a co-founder and board member of March for Our Lives, a youth-led organization dedicated to ending the gun violence epidemic in America.\n",

      "President-elect Donald Trump made a lot of promises on the campaign trail when it comes to tax policy, from ending the federal income tax in favor of tariffs to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, tips, and overtime pay . But if the past is prologue, there's only one he's certain to fulfill: massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. Let's review the game tape. When Trump was elected in 2016, economists, policy wonks, and Washington elites frequently criticized his policy agenda as unworkable, unrealistic, and unserious . But he was deadly serious about cutting taxes , and his signature legislative achievement, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, gave corporations a 40 percent discount on their taxes. It also delivered one of the single largest tax cuts for the wealthy in U.S. history, with the richest 0.1 percent of Americans getting a tax cut that was 277 times larger than that of middle-class households. While the bill didn't live up to its promises of higher pay for workers and increased economic growth, it did line the pockets of shareholders and CEOs , and added $1.9 trillion to the deficit . Next year, many of the president's signature tax cuts are slated to expire, teeing up a golden opportunity for him to work with a Republican Congress to go even further. Donald Trump's rise to power was underwritten by his \" billionaire boy's club ,\" and he's made it clear he intends to return the favor with even bigger handouts to the ultra-wealthy . This includes extending individual tax cuts to the richest Americans, further slashing the corporate tax rate to as low as 15 percent, reducing taxes on capital gains, and more. According to Sen. Mike Crapo, the incoming Senate Finance chair, \" everything is in play. \" These aren't policies Trump is trying to secretly pass, either. He's been loud and proud about wanting to cut taxes for his wealthy friends. He bragged about cutting taxes for the nation's \"highest\" earners. He even told his big oil donors , companies who pay some of the lowest effective tax rates in the country, that he would take care of them in exchange for $1 billion in campaign donations. And he won't be working alone. Major business lobbying groups in Washington like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have already promised tens of millions of dollars to the cause. Even former Vice President Mike Pence's dark money group has thrown $10 million into preserving the 2017 tax law . Just to reiterate: Conservatives are so obsessed with cutting taxes for the rich that the former vice president poured millions of dollars into protecting the legacy of a man who wanted him hanged . While Democrats will undoubtedly have a lot to fight against during a second Trump term that promises to be even more radical than the first, they must not lose sight of the stakes of next year's tax battle. Extending the failed Trump tax law would drastically exacerbate income inequality , balloon the deficit , and, perhaps most dangerously, place outsized political power in the hands of the corporations and the ultra-wealthy. For instance, the president-elect has promised to award close ally and mega-funder Elon Musk with a role as \" Secretary of Cost Cutting. \" For decades the Republican playbook has been a familiar two-step; tax cuts are just part one. Part two comes when they tout their self-inflicted lack of revenue as a reason to cut life-saving programs that families rely on. Musk even admitted that these cuts will \" involve some temporary hardship \" for Americans -- which is rich considering he himself has paid very little or nothing at all in income taxes in recent years. But Democrats learned an important lesson in 2017 too. Their unified opposition to Trump's tax cuts drove Trump to his lowest approval rating on record when he signed the bill into law that December and fueled a Blue Wave in the midterms the following year. Democratic leadership must unite the party to stand their ground -- and make sure the president-elect and his extreme allies in Congress feel political pain for handing out even more unpopular tax breaks to their ultra-wealthy friends and giant corporations, at the expense of working families. The results of last week's election, in which working class voters of all stripes swung toward Trump, suggest that they view Democrats as the party of their bosses, not them. We must use next year's tax fight as a chance to change that perception and start sowing the seeds of buyer's remorse. Families are still reeling from high costs. Let's remind them that Trump's first order of business will be to cut a check to companies who are overcharging them. Lindsay Owens is the executive director of Groundwork Action.\n"

      "President Joe Biden should commute the sentence of Charles Littlejohn, the former IRS contractor who was sentenced in January 2024 to five years in prison. By disclosing the federal tax records of Donald Trump , Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and other billionaires to news organizations, Littlejohn enabled vital reporting about how the wealthiest people in the United States end up paying less in taxes than public school teachers and firefighters. We're urging people to urge the president to act while he still has the power to do so. Our website, freecharleslittlejohn.com , facilitates the process of sending an email or a letter to the president asking him to commute Littlejohn's sentence. Despite performing a valuable public service, Littlejohn received the harshest possible punishment. While sentencing guidelines recommended four to 10 months in prison, District Judge Ana Reyes gave Littlejohn the statutory maximum sentence of five years. Remarkably, this punishment is far more severe than what wealthy Americans convicted of tax evasion typically face. Many cases that involve tax evasion do not even lead to a criminal indictment. Other cases have not resulted in jail time. Even when there is a prison sentence for tax evasion, it's often substantially shorter than Littlejohn's. Just this year, for example, an Oklahoma man instructed a payroll company working to falsely characterize over $2.6 million as reimbursements rather than income. His sentence for that massive fraud: 30 months, just one-half Littlejohn's 60-month sentence. Lighter sentences also have been imposed in cases involving massive leaks of private information. In one case, three Department of Homeland Security employees stole personally identifying information of 200,000 federal government employees from government databases, along with proprietary software, and passed it on to software developers in India. Despite having sought to personally benefit from the leak, they were sentenced far more leniently -- four and 18 month prison terms for two of them and two years' probation for the third -- than Littlejohn, who gained nothing personally from his actions. Judge Reyes condemned Littlejohn to five years behind bars after 25 congressional Republicans -- undoubtedly at the behest of their super-rich patrons -- wrote to her and requested the toughest possible sentence. That Reyes gave such a disproportionate punishment to someone who shed light on the scope of tax injustice in the U.S. reflects the extent to which our society is dominated by the interests of the ultra-wealthy. Reyes opined that Littlejohn's actions constituted \"an attack on our constitutional democracy\" -- one even worse than the deadly assault carried out by Jan. 6 insurrectionists, who sought to block certification of Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. Frankly, this contention is absurd. Littlejohn's effort to expose the extent of tax injustice in the U.S. was aimed at preserving the promise of democracy , which is imperiled by extreme inequality. Actually, Judge Reyes' harsh sentencing poses a far greater threat to democracy than anything Littlejohn did. Had Littlejohn leaked the tax records of several hundred bartenders and hair stylists who had failed to report tip income, he almost certainly would not have been sentenced to six times the recommended sentence. Which means that the sentence he received was based not on the nature of his act but on the power of those aggrieved by it . The Orwellian logic Reyes invoked in her sentencing opinion should frighten all of us. Exposing the tax information of people whose information is in the public interest -- a sitting president refusing to divulge information pertinent to his re-election campaign and billionaires whose avoidance activities are undermining the integrity of the tax system -- is, according to her logic, a far more serious offense than exposing tax information that should be of interest to nobody other than the IRS. The message is clear: Those with wealth or power are to be afforded greater legal protection than the rest of us. President-elect Trump has pledged to pardon individuals who were convicted for participating in his Jan. 6 coup attempt. Notably, many of the rioters received sentences shorter than Littlejohn's and shorter than prosecutors sought. It would be a perversion of justice if they are pardoned while Littlejohn is required to serve his full sentence. Littlejohn, who began his sentence on May 1, has already spent ample time locked up. The longer Littlejohn languishes in jail, the more he is at risk of retribution from Trump. The president-elect has vowed to persecute his political enemies, including an ominous threat to \"root out\" those he describes as \"radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.\" Given the outsized role Littlejohn had in exposing Trump's extreme tax avoidance, including possible IRS audit exposure, he very well could be on Trump's enemies list. As White House staff reportedly consider mass pardons for current and former public officials potentially at risk of a revenge-seeking Trump, Biden should extend protection to Littlejohn -- a selfless defender of tax fairness and democracy who may well be one of Trump's targets.

      "As former President Donald Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025 , it's becoming more clear how devastating it will be for our veterans . The conservative personnel and policy program, intended to guide the next Republican administration, is gaining attention as the presidential campaign heats up. Despite Trump's attempts to distance himself from its policy blueprint, he knows precisely what the project entails -- and who helped put it together. Many of Trump's former allies and appointees are deeply embedded in Project 2025. Six of his ex-Cabinet secretaries, four former ambassadors, and numerous enforcers of his immigration policies contributed to the project's 887-page \"Mandate for Leadership,\" which outlines far-right policy priorities for Trump to pursue in his second term. Former senior Trump administration officials Russ Vought and John McEntee have both been involved with Project 2025, and are expected to serve in top roles if Trump wins again. Notable figures like former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and advisor Stephen Miller both lead organizations that have been part of Project 2025. Additionally, lawyers involved in Trump's impeachment and election disputes, such as Jay Sekulow, Cleta Mitchell, and John Eastman, are key players. In total there are nearly 240 individuals with ties to both Project 2025 and Trump. Key contributors include former U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman, who was pivotal in Trump's criminal justice reform law, and other influential figures like Ben Carson, Christopher Miller, and John Ratcliffe. Project 2025's goals include disbanding federal agencies, privatizing others, and expanding presidential control over the executive branch. These proposals align closely with Trump's official campaign plan, Agenda47, which was recently adopted as the Republican Party's national platform. One of the most troubling aspects of Project 2025 is its clear hostility towards LGBTQ and transgender individuals, including veterans. Trump's administration has consistently targeted these communities, raising serious questions about his genuine support for all veterans. The project proposes eliminating federal protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, and enforcing a \"biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family.\" On education, it seeks to bar public education employees from using a name or pronoun different from what is listed on a student's birth certificate without parental permission, directly impacting transgender youth and their families. Additionally, Project 2025 calls for a 50 percent reduction in federal employees within a year and 75 percent within four years. It includes measures such as cutting federal jobs, disbanding agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, and privatizing the Transportation Security Administration. These proposals aim to radically reshape the federal government, aligning with Trump's agenda of reducing government size and influence. Veterans make up roughly 30 percent of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government. These individuals, having served their country in the military, have chosen to continue their service in a civilian capacity. They bring unparalleled dedication, discipline, and unique skill sets often not found in the private sector. Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department. Many federal agencies are veteran-heavy workplaces, offering opportunities for those who have served to continue contributing to public service, national security, and justice. These agencies are integral to a healthy and functioning government. Their employees include many veterans who have transitioned from military service to civilian roles. Drastically cutting jobs in federal agencies would disproportionately affect veterans, many of whom rely on these positions not only for employment but also for a sense of purpose and community. The ramifications of reducing the federal workforce extend beyond job losses; it would jeopardize the livelihoods of veterans and undermine the effectiveness of the government. Federal employees are crucial to the operation of various essential services, and the proposed reductions would severely limit the government's ability to function. During Trump's first term, the dismantling of federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Education left many veterans in those agencies unemployed or with reduced roles. This proposal by Project 2025 to go even further is alarming, not just for its potential effects on the efficiency and efficacy of government operations, but for the impact it would have on one of the nation's most revered groups: our veterans. Cutting federal jobs amid economic recovery is not a decision to be taken lightly. There is a responsibility to consider the broader societal implications, beyond immediate political gains. Veterans, who have already sacrificed so much, should not bear the burden of hasty political decisions. Trump and Republicans are pledging to \"take care of our veterans\" by ending 'luxury housing' and taxpayer benefits for undocumented immigrants, redirecting those savings to shelter and treat homeless veterans. However, states like New York are left to find their own ways to fund migrant support, raising doubts about whether any real savings would actually be available for veterans programs. The Trump administration's reforms to \"expand\" veterans' health care choices are widely recognized within the veteran community as a push to privatize the Department of Veterans Affairs -- an approach fiercely opposed by all major Veterans Service Organizations in the U.S. Trump also promises to 'hold low performers at the VA accountable,' but during his first term, more than 2,600 employees were fired , with only five being top officials. Most of those terminated were housekeepers, food service workers, and nursing assistants. This did little to reform the VA and instead caused staffing shortages, further denying veterans the care they need. Four years later, the VA is still struggling to catch up with staffing needs. Specific recommendations in Project 2025 include eliminating concurrent eligibility for disability and retirement benefits, restricting disability coverage, closing low-priority VA medical care enrollment, and privatizing the Department of Defense's TRICARE system. These measures aim to save billions but would substantially impact veterans' benefits and services. If these policies are enacted, veterans previously eligible for service-connected disabilities may see those benefits revised or taken away. The Project 2025 manual additionally criticizes the 1991 Agent Orange Act and the 2022 PACT Act, which aid veterans exposed to toxic substances, for overwhelming the VA's ability to process claims and increasing spending. As someone who worked on the 2022 PACT Act and met with sick and dying veterans, I couldn't disagree more with Project 2025's assessment. The removal or reduction of these expanded benefits would be detrimental to veterans who rely on these provisions for health and financial support, undermining the commitments made to those who have served their country. Real solutions should prioritize retraining and better allocation of resources, rather than drastic cuts that disproportionately impact veterans. For a nation that prides itself on honoring its veterans, eliminating their jobs should never be considered a viable policy. The push for such extreme measures under Project 2025, and their alignment with Trump's policies, reflects a broader agenda that prioritizes political strategy over the welfare of those who have served our country. It is vital to scrutinize these proposals and consider their real-world impact on veterans and the functionality of our government. Thoughtful and measured approaches are essential to maintaining a robust and effective federal workforce while honoring commitments to veterans. By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 threatens not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the nation's administrative capabilities and betraying our veterans. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the desires of a few who seek to dismantle the government.

      "Donald Trump 's politics of chaos and division are sucking America into a dark vortex, just seven weeks before an Election Day that could propel him back to the profound, and perilous, powers of the presidency. Trump is at his most dangerous when he's in a bind. Months after president Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, the MAGA authoritarian has still not found a political answer to the candidacy of Kamala Harris. And polls show him taking on water in the wake of a calamitous second debate performance. The moderation Trump that affected for his nominating convention in Milwaukee has been revealed as just an act, as he has reverted to more familiar, ugly political instincts. With Harris energizing and re-uniting her party's base, and in particular voters of color, Trump no longer sees political profit in trying to peel off disaffected Democrats. He is, instead, seeking to energize politically disengaged bigots, a shift that finds Trump fishing for support in the foulest waters of the far-right. That includes by making common cause with literal neo-Nazis, who are reveling in his demonization of recent Haitian arrivals in Ohio . We're now a week into Trump, and his soulless sidekick J.D. Vance, hyping a racist lie about Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield , Ohio, stealing and consuming their neighbors' pets as food. Vance, an Ohio senator, injected the rancid falsehood into the national conversation on Sept. 9 with a post on X , citing alleged \"chaos\" caused by the Caribbean arrivals and baselessly asserting that \"people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.\" In typical fashion, Trump turbocharged the bigotry a day later at the debate proclaiming, falsely: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats.\" With his myth of canine consumption, Trump is no longer dog whistling. His hate is a fog horn. \"You're talking about Haitian immigrants. You're talking about Black immigrants. If this is not bigotry and racism, I don't know what is,\" Delia Ramirez, a Democratic Congress member from Illinois who is also married to an undocumented immigrant, tells Rolling Stone . She calls Trump's rhetoric \"disgusting\" and \"mind boggling.\" Trump and Vance's lies have launched an armada of racist memes -- encouraged directly by Vance, who called the hateful keyboard warriors \"patriots.\" This imagery has been spread with glee by Trump's old stand-back-and-stand-by comrades, the Proud Boys , as well as by notorious far-right propagandists . The former president's son Don Jr. piled on with comments about Haitian immigrants so extreme that even The New York Times forthrightly described them as \" racist .\" The toxic rhetoric has led to real-life trouble in the town of Springfield. As detailed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday, the community has been beset by dozens of bomb threats . These have forced the evacuation of public schools and caused local colleges to suspend classes or move to online learning. The situation is so extreme that DeWine has called in state troopers to keep students safe. And a cultural festival celebrating the diversity of Springfield was also shut down -- giving new meaning to the term \"cancel culture.\" DeWine has called Trump and Vance's claims \"garbage.\" The Republican mayor of Springfield has also spoken out against Trump, insisting that his community is \"hurting\" and needs \"help, not hate.\" President Joe Biden has also stood up for decency, denouncing his predecessor's lies as \"simply wrong,\" adding, \"This has to stop, what he's doing. It has to stop.\" From Vance, the behavior has been particularly shocking. The Ohio senator admitted from the beginning that he was trafficking in hearsay: \"It's possible, of course,\" he wrote on X, \"that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.\" But that didn't stop members of the far-right media ecosystem from trying to prove the lie. The conservative activist Christopher Rufo offered up a $5,000 bounty on X for \"anyone who can provide my team with hard, verifiable evidence that Haitian migrants are eating cats\" in Springfield. He later surfaced what he alleged was a video from the nearby city of Dayton of \"African migrants\" barbecuing cats -- a claim that was re- promoted by Vance. The police in chief in Dayton quickly denounced the \"outlandish\" claim as baseless, insisting \"there is no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets.\" Trump has declined to denounce the bomb threats in Springfield, while doubling down on his claim that the town has been \"taken over by illegal migrants.\" (In truth, most of the Haitian arrivals have temporary legal status, due to the political upheaval in the Caribbean nation.) And Vance gave away the game during a weekend interview, revealing that he knows he's lying -- and doesn't care. \"The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,\" he said. \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.\" As Trump raised the national temperature to the boiling point, the anti-government Libertarian Party of New Hampshire wrote a post on X early Sunday morning reading: \"Anyone who murders Kamala Harris would be an American hero.\" (The post was soon deleted.) That same day, Trump himself emerged, again, as a target of extremist hate. While golfing at one of his Florida clubs Sunday, Trump was reportedly in grave danger, with an armed, would-be assassin hiding in the bushes. The suspect, who never fired a shot, is reportedly a former Trump supporter. (The gunman who nicked Trump's ear in Pennsylvania was also a Republican .) Bringing the day full circle, billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk then posted, and subsequently deleted, a message on X asking why \"no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,\" with a thinking emoji. Musk later claimed he'd been joking . (The Secret Service has said it's \"aware\" of the incident.) Trump is a proud foe of gun safety regulations -- recently bragging to the National Rifle Association that \"during my four years, nothing happened!\" He has also called on Americans to \" get over \" school shootings, while Vance recently described them as a \" fact of life .\" The pair, however, immediately changed their tune when Trump found himself again in danger from guns. Trump, absurdly, called on Democrats to dial down their political rhetoric, while in the same breath continuing to bash the president and vice president as an existential threat to the nation. Trump told Fox News of his would-be attacker: \"He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.\" He added: \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, while ... they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.\" Vance, who is helping terrorize his own constituents in Springfield, insisted it was dangerous for political opponents to label Trump a \"fascist\" -- even though Trump used that same term against Harris earlier this month. Vance also had the nerve to invoke the same Bible that calls on believers to welcome the stranger . \"At this moment in time, in 2024, with all the violence and all the negative political rhetoric,\" Vance said, \"we need to remember above and beyond that we must love our neighbors , that we must treat other people as we hope to be treated.\" To paraphrase another passage from the Bible, Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are sowing the wind -- with hate, bigotry and division. It's up to voters to ensure American values, and our democracy, can withstand the whirlwind that's coming.\n",

      "In 2014, a teenage idiot was caught taking a leak in an urban reservoir in Portland, Oregon. The diluted pee was no health threat; the reservoir is open air, and birds shit and piss in it daily. But the city made a decision, seemingly fit for a Portlandia sketch, to treat the reservoir as a ginormous urinal, flushing all 38 million gallons, before refilling the bowl. I was raised in arid California , where water conservation is a form of morality. As a then-recent transplant to the rain-drenched Pacific Northwest, witnessing this preposterous waste of reservoir water was something akin to watching a big-game hunter kill an elephant for sport. These ghastly feelings surfaced again last week as President Donald Trump ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to uselessly dump \"billions\" of gallons of water from reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Bakersfield -- attempting to warp physical reality to match his twisted hallucinations about California's water engineering. Trump's order followed weeks of ignorant bluster about how the catastrophic Los Angeles wildfires could have been prevented if only state officials had turned a mythical \" valve \" to send more water to Southern California. Trump displays no demonstrable knowledge of how wildfire works. Los Angeles was vulnerable to the catastrophic firestorms of the past month because the region had received 0.16 inches of rainfall since June, a full four inches below average, in the driest stretch in more than 60 years. It was a drought exacerbated by climate change . This lack of rainfall made the grasses and scrub where foothills meet the Los Angeles cityscape -- what planners call the urban-wild interface -- into a tinderbox. Trump, whose idea of getting out into nature is playing 18 holes at a manicured golf course, can't seem to fathom that the canyons and brushlands surrounding America's second-largest metropolis don't benefit from sprinkler irrigation. Local water issues likely hampered Southern California firefighters. But they had nothing to do with state-led water rationing. A reservoir serving Pacific Palisades sat empty because it had been drained for maintenance. And the hurricane-force Santa Ana winds that whipped the firestorms also kept firefighting aircraft out of the sky, overtaxing reliance on municipal water to fight the flames. But such nuance is lost on the 47th president. Trump has had California water politics living rent-free in his head since he first learned of state efforts to ensure sufficient fresh water for the endangered Delta Smelt, a small fish that lives near the mouth of the Sacramento River in Northern California. Trump perceives this modest act of environmental preservation as putting a \" worthless fish \" over water-hungry farms and human profits. Trump has been so exercised over this issue that he threatened to withhold disaster aid from California on the campaign trail, unless Gov. Gavin \"Newscum\" curtailed natural river outflows. And on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order absurdly titled: \" Putting People Over Fish: Stopping Radical Environmentalism to Provide Water to Southern California .\" As Trump blustered, a combination of brave firefighting and actual rainstorms enabled nearly complete containment of the wildfires last week. But Trump was still determined to act -- to match his big mouth with bigger action. And so, on Friday , the Army Corps abruptly began emptying reservoirs that flow into the Central Valley -- lowering lakes that are at least a three-hour drive north of Los Angeles, on the other side of the Tehachapi Mountains. This squandering of water made the Portland urinal flush look like a child's game. It more resembled the malevolent act of a mad king. On Truth Social, Trump posted a photo of the \"beautiful water flow that I just opened in California,\" touting a one-day release of \"1.6 billion gallons\" and bragging that \"in 3 days, it will be 5.2 billion gallons.\" Trump insisted \"everybody should be happy\" about his \"Victory!\" He added nonsensically: \"I only wish they listened to me six years ago -- There would have been no fire!\" In reality, Trump is double-crossing the very farmers whose water interests he's long claimed to represent. There was little coordination with state and local officials, meaning Trump's big flush threatened to create an actual flood. Only pushback by local agriculture interests and state officials persuaded the Army Corps to lessen the outflows to avert a disaster. Alex Padilla, California's senior senator, has already written an angry letter slamming the administration for \" recklessly endangering residents downstream .\" And even Trump admitted Monday: \"We did it a very rough way.\" Worse, by dumping reservoirs during the rainy season, Trump is setting up hardship for farmers during the summer growing months -- when temperatures soar, the ground cracks, and those precious gallons won't be available to Central Valley growers who feed the nation and create profitable exports. Will the dumped water find any productive use? For now the sole perceivable benefit is creating optics to aggrandize the president himself. \"The water is flowing in California,\" he posted on Truth Social, adding pictures showing Central Valley canals he described as \"brimming with beautiful, clean water, and heading to farmers throughout the State, and to Los Angeles.\" Americans rely on government to protect us -- or at the very least do us no harm. But for Trump, this duty as protector in chief is always subordinate to an insatiable need for aggrandizement, to paint himself as the bold actor, and the strong man. As he said of the water release Monday: \"I had to do it. And it was not easy.\"\n"

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is more than just a health care provider for those who have served -- it stands as a symbol of what a national, government-run health care system could achieve if scaled to the broader American population. This is precisely why Republican leaders and conservative think tanks have spent years trying to dismantle it, using privatization as their Trojan horse. The VA is not perfect -- no system is -- but its shortcomings should be addressed through reform and investment, not by dismantling the system entirely. Pete Hegseth , the former Fox News commentator whom Donald Trump wants to lead the Pentagon , has demonstrated that he fundamentally misunderstands the VA and the care it provides to our veterans. Discussing veteran disability ratings in 2019, Hegseth claimed : \"I could be rated for 50 percent right now if I wanted to be.\" Hegseth, who has no combat injuries, would be highly unlikely to qualify for a 50 percent disability rating. His misconception extends further, as he appears to believe that every rating the VA assigns simply adds up to increase a veteran's overall rating -- which is not how the system works. For instance, the VA can issue multiple 10 percent ratings, but a veteran's overall rating might still remain at 10 percent. Similarly, the VA frequently issues zero percent ratings; I personally have three of those. Even more troubling is Hegseth's bias against veterans seeking care. In that same Fox News discussion, he claimed that veterans advocacy groups \"encourage vets to apply for every government benefit they can ever get after they leave the service,\" adding that \"a lot of groups are convincing vets to take more from the system as opposed to just what you need for the service you gave.\" As a Junior U.S. Minnesota National Guard Reserve Officer, Hegseth has no understanding of what active-duty veterans who served three, four, or even five tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond have endured. This lack of perspective renders him wholly unfit to serve as the secretary of defense. Hegseth's disdain for our veterans goes beyond his complete lack of understanding of what soldiers, sailors, and Marines experience, and the care they need -- and earned. The VA is the closest thing the United States has to universal health care. It provides integrated care to millions of veterans, many of whom suffer from complex, service-related injuries that private health care systems are ill-equipped to address. The VA's strength lies in its specialized expertise, its ability to coordinate care across multiple disciplines, and its capacity to address the unique needs of veterans, from PTSD to prosthetics. Studies have consistently shown that the VA outperforms the private sector in quality of care, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. After years of trial, error, and legislation, the VA has become pretty damned good at providing health care to its veterans. What often gets lost in the conversation about the VA is its \"Fourth Mission\": to improve the nation's preparedness for emergencies, including war, terrorism, natural disasters, and public health crises. The VA isn't just a health care provider for veterans -- it's a cornerstone of the nation's emergency response infrastructure. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the VA deployed personnel to more than 50 states and territories, providing direct patient care, testing, and critical resources like personal protective equipment (PPE). Over 1.1 million pieces of PPE -- including gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields -- were distributed to state and local facilities. In addition, the VA admitted 697 nonveteran citizens for care at VA medical centers, underscoring its commitment to serving the broader public in times of crisis. This support wasn't limited to equipment. The VA offered ventilators, oxygen concentrators, and even mountable Plexiglas isolation stations to bolster health care systems nationwide. It provided training and education for state and community nursing homes and deployed staff to assist facilities overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. This level of integrated, rapid-response action exemplifies what a well-funded, centralized health care system can achieve -- not just for its core beneficiaries, but for the entire nation. Tearing down a vital source of medical infrastructure that took decades to master would be the undoing of the American health care system as we know it. The VA exposes the fallacy of the GOP's argument that government-run health care is inherently inefficient. It proves that a well-funded, centralized health care system can deliver better outcomes at a lower cost -- and even play a critical role in national emergency preparedness. For Republicans, this is an existential threat to their anti-government ideology. If the VA can work for veterans and support the nation in times of crisis, why not expand a similar model to all Americans? Hegseth, Trump's nominee to run the Pentagon, and Doug Collins, Trump's nominee to lead the VA, have both advocated for the privatization of veterans' health care, framing it as an issue of giving veterans more \"choice.\" They have been outspoken critics of VA health care, despite neither having significant combat experience nor a personal reliance on the VA's specialized, vital services for those wounded in combat. This so-called choice, however, comes with hidden costs: the dismantling of the VA's integrated system, skyrocketing expenditures, and the erosion of expertise critical to veterans' care. Privatization wouldn't just harm veterans; it would also strip the nation of a critical tool for emergency preparedness. Privatizing the VA would mean transferring veterans' care to a system driven by profit rather than outcomes. Private providers lack the expertise to handle conditions like toxic exposures, combat-related trauma, and complex prosthetics. Moreover, the private sector's profit motives often lead to care denial, not care delivery. The VA's Fourth Mission underscores the dangers of dismantling this system. In times of crisis, no private health care model can replicate the VA's ability to rapidly deploy resources, personnel, and expertise to meet the nation's needs. From Covid-19 to natural disasters, the VA has proven itself indispensable not just to veterans, but to the country as a whole. This mission, combined with the VA's other critical roles -- such as honoring, cremating, and interning deceased veterans through the National Cemetery Administration and supporting service members with benefits like the GI Bill and VA home loans -- demonstrates the comprehensive value of this institution. This fundamental misunderstanding underscores the larger issue: Veterans like Hegseth and Collins, a former military chaplain, lack firsthand experience with the challenges faced by combat-injured veterans. Veterans overwhelmingly value the VA for its specialized care and community support. Even critics acknowledge that the VA's integrated system is uniquely capable of addressing the complex needs of veterans and providing critical emergency support. The debate over the VA is a microcosm of the broader health care debate in America. Those who seek to privatize the VA are not just attacking veterans' health care; they are attacking the very idea of public health care. They fear that the VA's success could inspire Americans to demand a universal system for everyone. And they're right to be afraid. If the VA can provide high-quality care to millions of veterans and act as a linchpin in national emergencies, it could serve as a blueprint for a national system that ensures no American is left without health care. The fight for the VA is not just a fight for veterans -- it's a fight for the soul of American health care and emergency preparedness. We must defend it, not just for those who have served, but for the promise it holds for us all. Michael Embrich is a veteran, a former member of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans, and a former congressional staffer .\n",

      "Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration been hell-bent on striking fear into the heart of America's immigrant communities . In a series of executive orders filed in his first 10 days, Trump attempted to end birthright citizenship for children born to parents without at least one permanent-resident status; authorized all Department of Justice law enforcement officers to act as immigration officers; and has already begun ICE raids across the country, many of which have not only targeted immigrants without criminal records but also involved the detainment of U.S. citizens. Many of Trump's actions, like his attempt to end birthright citizenship, have been challenged through legal avenues. But Heidi Altman, Vice President of Policy at the National Immigration Law Center, tells Rolling Stone that many Trump administration policies are also about stoking emotions. \"The executive orders he took on his first day in office lay the groundwork for Trump to separate countless loved ones from their families, deprive essential industries of needed workers, shut the United States' doors to refugees and people seeking asylum, and create an immigration police state rife with racial profiling and cruelty,\" Altman says. \"Fear is the centerpiece of all of Trump's actions targeting immigrants and the catalyst for his mass deportation agenda.\" Katarina Ramos, a managing attorney for the National Immigrant Justice Center , tells Rolling Stone that emotions surrounding Trump's immigration blitz are understandable -- which is why she encourages people to not only know their rights but feel empowered to use them in encounters with immigration officers. \"We're seeing a lot of fear, we're hearing it from our clients, from community partners, from community members, from friends and family, too,\" she says. \"We're trying to focus as much as possible on making sure that people know that they have rights, but also feel empowered to exercise those rights.\" Know Your Rights pamphlets -- also known as KYRs -- are compiled by various organizations and contain helpful and digestible information for people who might have encounters with immigration officers. Here's what you should know. What immigration officers are legally required to present to you differs depending on where you are. If you're at your home, ICE needs a judicial warrant -- a warrant signed by a judge -- in order for them to enter your home. If someone knocks at your door who you think might be an immigration officer, you don't have to open the door. You also should not step outside or follow an officer anywhere to see a warrant. \"We all have this instinct if someone knocks on the door, you open the door,\" Ramos says. \"So [make] sure, if you're comfortable, you're asking whoever is at the door to identify themselves. It's a cliche, but your home is your castle.\" All warrants aren't created equal. Ramos adds that many ICE officers tend to present administrative warrants that are issued by another ICE officer or the Department of Homeland Security, but these still don't grant entry into a private citizen's home. If an immigration officer presents you a warrant, you should check that it is signed by a judge, has the specific name of the person they're looking for, their exact address, and a validity period that it's good for. You can ask officers to pass the warrant underneath the door. Alway check that the warrant in correct before you open the door. This isn't the same at workplaces, as ICE officers can enter and detain people if they have direct permission from a businesses' owner. If you are detained, do not try to run. Instead, exercise the rest of your rights, as explained below. The Fifth Amendment grants people the right to remain silent. Anything you say to officers, even while you are being detained, could be used against you in your case later. Ramos adds that the best way to exercise your right is by saying the words out loud. \"You need to say, 'I wish to remain silent.' And once you say that, you don't have to answer any questions,\" she says. You can say it at any point, even if you've already answered some. Immigration experts say those with valid immigration documents should show them when asked, but if you're undocumented, you should remain silent when asked for documents. You do not have to answer any questions about your immigration status, where you were born, your address, or any personal information. \"We advise all of our clients not to carry any false documents. It's just not a good idea,\" Ramos says. \"The other thing we would advise is if someone is being asked for an identity document by ICE, don't present an identity document that's going to tell ICE you might not be from the United States originally. So a lot of people use consular ID cards as their form of identification, but that's automatically telling ICE I might be a Mexican citizen, or I might be a citizen of whatever country issued that ID card.\" Once you are detained, you should immediately seek legal help, either by contacting an attorney you already know or having a family member reach out to a local immigration lawyer. While you wait for the attorney, make sure not to sign anything and continue to remain silent. Conversations between an attorney and their client are confidential, but phone lines in ICE facilities are not. So if you are given a phone call, do not discuss anything about your immigration status with any family or friends. It's also important to refuse to sign any paperwork you don't understand. \"We're seeing documents that may be in very complex legal terms that people don't understand what they're signing. There's a process that we've seen called stipulated removal orders, where people are unknowingly signing their own deportation order, and waiving their right to have that day in front of a judge,\" Ramos says. \"Don't sign anything you don't understand, whether it's because it's in English, or just in really complicated legalese.\" Encountering immigration officers can be scary, even if you're a U.S. citizen, but for those worried about their status, it can be helpful to have information and resources prepared ahead of time. Pilar Rocha-Golberg, Executive Director of El Centro Hispano in North Carolina, tells Rolling Stone that preparation can take away stress if you are detained by immigration. This includes having the phone number of a lawyer on hand that you know can help. It is also helpful to have all of your immigration paperwork in one place where it's easily accessible. For people who have kids, having an emergency contact with legal residency status who has permission to pick them up from school can also be helpful. \"Have an action plan. Hopefully, you never need it, but if you do, you are prepared,\" Ramos adds. \"Make sure you have an emergency contact who has some form of lawful status here in the United States and knows where your documents are stored at home. Have, in a secure place, documents that are going to show [your] history here in the United States so you already have everything organized and you're ready to defend or present your case without needing to try and think about, 'Where is my pay stub from five years ago?'\" Even if you're a citizen or permanent resident, there are ways you can help your community members. Rocha-Golberg encourages those that are concerned with Trump's new policies to get in contact with local immigration law centers in their cities, especially as further Trump policies might target federal grants and funding. \"We are asking our allies to also participate in these Know Your Rights sessions to learn the things they can continue telling the people from our community. They can help with administrative tasks, they can donate, and they can help at power of attorney clinics and drives. We need notaries, we need lawyers, we need interpreters.\" \"One of the things that is really important is bearing witness to what is happening. If you are out in the community and you do see an ICE action or raid taking place, record it,\" Ramos says. \"Make sure that the people who are being detained know that there's somebody there who has their side. People can feel really alienated during these times, and it's really important for people to just know that you're not alone and that there are people who support you.\" Since the Trump administration has continued to target immigrant communities, many federal officials have spoken out against Know Your Rights informative sessions and training. When talking about Chicago, where ICE recently conducted several raids, Trump border czar, Tom Homan, called Know Your Rights training \"how to escape arrest\" in an interview with CNN . But knowing your rights isn't a crime -- it's a helpful tool and necessary for communities that might be impacted by Trump's crackdowns. \"These Know Your Rights materials that are provided to immigrant communities can be lifesaving,\" Altman says. No matter who is president, everyone living in the U.S. has certain basic rights under the U.S. Constitution. Undocumented immigrants have these rights, too. It is important that we all assert and protect our basic rights.\" For more information on Know Your Rights training and information, visit El Centro Hispano , the National Immigration Law Center , or the National Immigrant Justice Center .\n"

      "Mandy Moen's children didn't get Christmas presents this year, but their family tried to make the best of the situation. They fastened a long string of beads to the wall in the shape of a Douglas fir, and thumbtacked ornaments to the living room drywall, including a miniature plastic TV set, a plush cardinal, and an iridescent green pickle. They even created a fake fireplace out of paper bags. \"We're pretty creative,\" says Moen, whose name has been changed to protect her family's safety. Even if her kids had gotten presents, Moen says they would have just been forced to get rid of them anyway. Their family began preparing to leave the United States following Donald Trump 's win in the presidential election, which Moen says made her fearful for her children's futures. Since he took office, Trump has issued a flurry of executive orders following through on his campaign promises to target trans Americans . Among them, he has signed orders targeting gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth, banning trans people from serving openly in the U.S. military, defining gender as binary and assigned at birth, and threatening schools that support trans youth with the loss of federal funding. Like many parents of trans youth now scrambling to protect their children, Moen could sense that the worst-case scenario was imminent. \"I just sat and cried,\" Moen says of election night. \"There's just too much hate in the world. There's no reason for it. No one's hurting anyone by being who they are.\" After the shock wore off, Moen decided that the only way to keep her kids safe was to leave the country as soon as possible. Initially, she had planned on putting her three children and four cats in an RV and driving across the border to Canada, where she would claim asylum. Moen had joined a Facebook group in Montreal where locals offered to give them a place to stay for a week or two while they got settled -- or even let them park their camper in the driveway for a place to sleep. But claiming asylum in the country is extremely difficult to begin with, and fearing she wouldn't be able to learn French well enough to obtain a work visa through potential employers, the family instead decided upon Scotland, which was rated Europe's most LGBTQ+ friendly country in a 2016 report from the advocacy group ILGA-Europe. Moen has booked plane tickets for later this month, and she has been selling their belongings for weeks. Each child is only allowed to take one suitcase and a single box of personal possessions with them -- forcing Denise, aged nine, to part with her favorite dollhouse and Reese, eight, his cherished toy cars. \"I don't want to move,\" says Denise, who notes that she will also be leaving behind friends she's known most of her life. \"It's going to be stressful.\" The Moens are just one of many families of trans youth fleeing the U.S. in fear of what a second Trump presidency might mean for their lives. The worst could still be yet to come: While campaigning for the White House, Trump's 2024 website stated, if reelected, he would urge Congress to pass a federal law \"prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states.\" And just days after its issuance, the president's gender-affirming care order is already having a major chilling effect on doctors and medical providers. Hospitals in Colorado, New York, and Virginia have said that they will temporarily pause transition care for minors while they weigh the implications of Trump's edict, although New York Attorney General Letitia James has directed providers in the state to continue treating trans youth patients. Even before Trump took office, the federal government already hinted at what could be to come. In December, the U.S. House of Representatives instituted an anti-trans bathroom rule targeting freshman lawmaker Sarah McBride (D-Del.), the nation's first out trans member of Congress, and President Joe Biden signed into law a must-pass defense bill with a provision stripping away coverage for trans youth health care under TRICARE, the military's insurance plan. Under the latter move, the children of active duty service members would no longer be able to receive gender-affirming medical care, making it the first explicitly anti- LGBTQ+ law adopted by the U.S. government since \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" in 1993. But families hoping to escape the long shadow of Trump's policies may experience extreme challenges in getting to safety. Many countries are tightening their requirements for immigration and asylum, including countries historically viewed as favorable to refugees. Fifteen member countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Italy, drafted a letter in May 2024 asking European Union leaders to restrict the ability of refugees to seek asylum, just months after the bloc approved new rules that could indefinitely jail asylum seekers, including children. The letter advises that asylum seekers be sent to a \"third country\" while their asylum claims are processed -- similar to policies that the Trump administration is itself exploring -- and urges expedited deportment of refugees whose claims are refused. The Moens will likely face these barriers themselves in Scotland, which is under the U.K.'s purview on immigration. The number of student visa applications reportedly plummeted after the U.K. implemented new rules barring international undergraduate and master's students from bringing their dependents with them. Although Moen floated the idea of going back to school in Scotland to finish her nursing degree, her visa would not cover her children unless she sought a doctorate. She has already begun putting in applications to healthcare companies that would potentially grant her a work visa if she were to be offered a position. If she is unable to find employment, Moen plans to file an asylum claim. Moen knows that moving is a huge risk, but it's one she feels they have been forced to take. \"It seems like that's become the reality of people with queer family members, trans kids, or trans spouses,\" she says. \"And that's become our life now: moving to protect ourselves or leaving and going somewhere else. We're not allowed to have regular lives anymore. Our kids aren't allowed to be who they are. We have to just pick up and go.\" While there is no hard data on the number of LGBTQ+ families seeking to leave the U.S. following Trump's win, experts tell Rolling Stone there are unprecedented levels of interest from trans people and their loved ones. Jessica Drucker, the founder of Rainbow Relocation Strategies , which assists LGBTQ+ people in moving abroad, says that she received five times the typical number of requests for consultations in the month following the election. The average post in a private Facebook group she runs for queer expatriates and aspiring emigres now receives as many 4,500 comments in an hour; before the election, traffic to the page was modest. Aleks Dughman-Manzur, co-executive director of the Vancouver-based nonprofit Rainbow Refugee , says that the eight Canadian organizations focused on immigrants and asylum seekers in his network received over 800 inquiries from the U.S. the day after the election. The influx of requests was particularly dramatic for Rainbow Railroad , which is perhaps the most widely known nonprofit in the world focused on helping LGBTQ+ people flee unsafe countries. The organization received almost 1,117 requests for help from the U.S. in the day after the election -- more contacts than it had received from Americans over an entire year. At least 51 percent of those requests were from trans people seeking to leave the U.S., and the majority sought direct aid with international relocation, the group reports. \"It's the most requests for help we've ever received from a country in one day,\" says Catherine Hampton, the senior advisor for U.S. strategy at Rainbow Railroad. \"Even at the height of the Afghanistan crisis, when the Taliban were taking over in August 2021, the highest daily number of requests that we received from Afghanistan was 119.\" Although Canada is a popular destination for U.S. families of trans youth hoping to claim asylum abroad, prospective refugees may run into several roadblocks. Swathi Sekhar, director of protection initiatives at Rainbow Railroad, says that Canada's immigration system is \"very limited in scope\" and predominantly functions as a \"measure of last resort.\" To present an asylum case, individuals will need to demonstrate that they have \"exhausted absolutely all avenues for protection\" in their countries of origin, Sekhar adds. If Canadian immigration officials allege that parents with trans kids have the choice of simply moving to a more progressive state for safety -- even though there's no guarantee anywhere in the U.S. is safe for them under Trump -- it could, thus, impede a potential asylum claim. \"There are so many people who face very real persecution that just don't meet that restrictive legal definition,\" Sekhar says. \"People who are fleeing a situation of generalized conflict may not actually qualify as a refugee, even though they are. Their lives are at risk, and they can't live with dignity. It's a really high standard that a lot of people can't meet.\" Canada has a mixed track record on granting asylum from the U.S. on the basis of trans identity. The country is bound by the Safe Third Country Agreement , which bars individuals from the U.S. from claiming asylum at the border. Although Rainbow Refugee said that refugees who initially entered the country on tourist visas had recently experienced \"positive\" outcomes in their claims, Canada's Federal Court in February 2024 overturned a decision from the Refugee Appeal Division granting asylum to Daria Bloodworth, a trans American who fled after being stalked and threatened by a former roommate. Judge Christine Pallotta claimed that Bloodworth had not \"demonstrated with clear and convincing evidence\" that, prior to her entry into Canada, she had explored every \"course of action reasonably available to her, without success.\" Regarding a possible influx in refugee claims under Trump, Canada's immigration minister, Marc Miller, claims that the country has not yet seen a surge in asylum. He has said, however, that Canada has begun preparing for the impact of Trump's executive orders, including those calling for the mass deportation of undocumented workers. \"Canada will be firm and fair,\" he told CBC News . \"We absolutely won't be cruel.\" However, families of trans youth do not only have the option of applying for refugee status. As a consultant, Drucker often advises clients to seek out countries that offer digital nomad visas, which permit remote workers to remain for a certain period of time. Among the most sought-after nations, she says, are Spain, Portugal, Malta, Uruguay, and Thailand, but these applications often include burdensome income and residency requirements. While Mexico allows individuals to stay for up to four years on a digital nomad visa, Moen's family would not be eligible: As a single mother with three children, she would need to make more than $5,100 a month to qualify. Those requirements are fairly standard. Other options for families with trans children include applying as skilled migrants or seeking student visas, each of which come with their own significant hurdles. After Trump's reelection, Margaret Anderson, whose name has also been changed for her safety, pulled her 21-year-old trans daughter, Jane, out of community college in Texas; she is working on transferring her to a university in France where she can finish her education safely. Jane is currently enrolled in an intensive language course to ensure that she is fluent enough before the fall. Meanwhile, Anderson and her husband are preparing for all that moving their daughter overseas will entail: securing passports, finding an apartment abroad, and making sure that she meets every application deadline. Because her family members won't be going with her, the reality is that Jane will very soon be in a foreign country, alone, that she has never even visited. Having watched their home state repeatedly target families like hers, Anderson feels they have no choice but to act quickly because she knows how bad things can get. In February 2022, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate parents of trans youth for child abuse. Texas passed a trans youth medical care ban the last time its legislature met in 2023, and Anderson worries that the coming session could bring a sweeping bathroom ban or health care restrictions for trans adults. She and her husband had initially planned on moving their daughter to California, but under Trump, Jane's parents feel they must get her as far away as possible. \"Some people may read this and think, 'Look at these people. They can move their child to France, and they're complaining about it,'\" says Anderson. \"But she wouldn't be doing this if she didn't have to. There are sacrifices on her part to leave friends and family that she loves. Every space I walk into, I just want to scream. I'm in so much pain. I feel like my left arm has been cut off. I just am screaming with grief.\" The reality is that most families with trans children will not be able to leave the U.S., even if they wanted to. In addition to the expense of fleeing the country, the Trump administration has begun refusing all gender marker corrections on U.S. passports following the issuance of an executive order also barring \"X\" gender markers. In a January memo , Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that all passports issued by the State Department must henceforth \"reflect the holder's sex.\" That could lead to complications for families who do not already have corrected documentation for their children, potentially impeding their ability to leave the country. Cathryn Oakley, senior director of legal policy for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), says that few of the families within the national LGBTQ+ advocacy group's networks have discussed moving abroad as a result of the election. That's because, she says, the families who are the \"most vulnerable\" under a second Trump presidency \"are the people that won't be able to leave.\" While the coming four years will be challenging, Oakley stresses that even a hostile administration can't undo decades of gains won by the equality movement overnight. A major protection for the LGBTQ+ community under Trump will be the U.S. Supreme Court's groundbreaking 2020 ruling finding that federal workplace laws barring discrimination also apply to queer and trans employees, a protection that activists will continue fighting to expand to areas like housing, education, and public accommodations. \"This is not something I think folks necessarily need to be thinking about en masse right now, rather that people need to be weighing their own individual level of risk, talking to professionals about what makes the most sense for them, and weighing something that is specifically geared toward their own personal situation,\" Oakley says. \"It is not the advice of HRC that folks absolutely need to leave simply because they identify as trans. So much of it has to do just based on your own situation: where you live in the country and your access to resources.\" Although being able to leave may seem like a privilege to some, it sure doesn't feel like it to Moen, who has already been forced to leave her home once before. She fled Texas with her children a year after Gov. Abbott began directing child welfare agents to knock on the doors of families like hers. Moen was reported to DFPS by someone who claimed she was \"forcing\" her children to be trans, and after escaping to Connecticut in fear her kids would be taken away, the Moens were homeless for three months. While they saved up for an apartment in their new state, Moen and her kids lived in their van, where they subsisted on gas station food: beef jerky, mini muffins, and turkey sandwiches. On one occasion, her eldest daughter attempted to eat the uncooked flakes out of a cup of instant potatoes because they didn't have access to a microwave. \"We barely had any food,\" recalls Reese, Moen's youngest. As they prepare to leave for Scotland, Moen is trying to remain hopeful for her children's benefit. A certified pharmacy tech, phlebotomist, and medical assistant, she will have six months to remain in the country legally on a tourist visa. Moen hopes to obtain lodging -- and maybe even have a job lined up -- before they depart, but she knows that there's always the likelihood that they may wind up unhoused again. It's also possible that their soon-to-be home may not prove as safe as they wish. \"It makes you very angry,\" Moen says. \"I just can't wake up from the nightmare. It's one thing for me to have to do this twice now but my kids have to go through this again when they shouldn't have even had to go through it the first time. I sound positive, but deep down, I have really lost my ability to hope.\"\n"

      "Dear women and girls of America, These last two years have been incredibly hard. Practically overnight, women lost a right we had counted on for nearly 50 years -- and an entire generation lost the freedom to make their own decisions about their lives and futures. If hearing the news that Roe v. Wade had been overturned left you heartbroken, scared, or furious -- maybe even all three -- you were in good company. There were so many protests in the months after that disastrous Supreme Court decision that some people called it \"the Summer of Rage.\" Women my age were gutted; no mother in the world wants her daughter to have fewer rights than she did. Young people were outraged that politicians they'd had no say in electing had unilaterally made a decision that would alter the course of their lives. Now, after two years of waiting, our moment is here. Together, we have the power to change the direction of this country. And we are going to do it by electing Kamala Harris and Tim Walz . When Roe v. Wade was overturned, we didn't just sit around. We channeled our rage into action. We spread the word about organizations like Plan C, which provides abortion pills by mail in all 50 states. We donated to abortion funds working overtime to support people suddenly being forced to travel hundreds or even thousands of miles for basic health care. We organized to put abortion rights initiatives on state ballots. We helped friends, family members, and strangers find their way to compassion and care. And it made a difference: In almost every state that banned abortion, the number of people who got abortions went up , not down. Today, an overwhelming majority of Americans support legal abortion. In every state where abortion has been on the ballot since Roe was overturned -- California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, and Vermont -- abortion rights have won. And what really broke through -- what forever changed the way Americans think and talk about the issue of abortion -- were stories. Women , men , doctors , medical students , doulas , faith leaders , and family members came forward to share personal stories of how abortion bans have affected their lives, their communities, and their ability to care for their patients. In Louisiana, Kaitlyn Joshua described being turned away from not one but two emergency rooms in the middle of a miscarriage. In Texas, Ryan Hamilton spoke about the horror of finding his wife bleeding and unconscious on their bathroom floor after she was denied miscarriage treatment. In Mississippi, journalist Charlotte Alter reported the story of Ashley , a 12-year-old who was sexually assaulted by a stranger in her front yard. Because Ashley's mother could not get her to Chicago for an abortion, Ashley started seventh grade as the parent of a newborn. For two years, we've been living with this reality. Now, we have an opportunity to change it. Nobody sums up how we got here better than Donald Trump . In his own words: \"For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it, and I'm proud to have done it.\" If he is elected president again, make no mistake: He will sign a national abortion ban. And he'll go even further, going after birth control and fertility treatments that so many Americans depend on to build their families. He'll force states to monitor women's pregnancies and abortions , and even come after no-fault divorce . (Literally -- it's right there in Project 2025, Republicans' governing plan.) Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has spent her entire career in public service, fighting for one thing: freedom. As vice president, she took on the issue of maternal mortality, and led the administration's response to the loss of abortion rights after Roe. She became the first sitting president or vice president to visit a Planned Parenthood health center . She has spent hours listening to health care workers, pregnant people, abortion rights advocates, and people directly impacted by the crisis that Donald Trump caused. As president, Harris will proudly sign a law restoring reproductive freedom nationwide. She'll fight for affordable child care, help launch women-owned small businesses, and invest in home care options for older or disabled family members -- which would radically change the lives of the (mostly) women in caregiving roles. Simply put: Kamala Harris gets it, and she will fight for us every single day. There is so much at stake in this election -- for women, for families, and for our democracy. Not only in the presidential race, but in down-ticket races and in the ten states where abortion is quite literally on the ballot this year. One day our children and grandchildren may ask us: When it was all on the line, what did you do? And the only acceptable answer is -- everything we could. So with just days left in the most consequential election for reproductive freedom this country has ever seen, let's do it all: Make calls, knock doors, and talk to our friends and family about why their vote matters. And then, with joy in our hearts and our heads held high, let's cast our votes for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I know we can do this. Love, Cecile\n",
      "Final text\n",
      "Kamala Harris has not given birth to children -- and is therefore unfit to be president of the United States of America -- appears to be the first line of attack the GOP has come up with since the presidential race was upended this weekend when President Joe Biden dropped out. Which is so predictable it borders on laughable. Except if the last decade has taught us anything, it's that the GOP is deadly serious in its endeavor to turn Onion headlines into political platforms and subsequently laws. It's also in keeping with the messaging the GOP has been trying to attach to Harris for a while now. In 2021, now-VP nominee J.D. Vance warned against a ruling political party dominated \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" He was referring to Harris, AOC, and Pete Buttigieg (who, with his husband, became parents to two adopted infant twins in 2021). First of all, Kamala is not childless. (Nor does she appear to be miserable. Whether she owns a cat is unclear.) And even if she were, this would not make her less than: Less than human, less than woman, less than capable. Less able to successfully run the country. Goodness knows, being married and having children has not been the redeeming factor in any number of people who have been, or want to be or, are currently in charge. Harris does have children, however. She is the stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children with his first wife, and they refer to her as Mamala. They have, by all accounts , a loving and supportive relationship. One might argue that navigating the blending of a family and negotiating the role of stepparent, and doing it well, calls on exactly the skills a person needs to lead a divisive country. These stepchildren apparently do not \" count ,\" though. Which raises any number of thorny questions: At what age should she have stepped into the role of step-parenting to make it \"count\"? Is there an age? Or does parenting a child who is not genetically your own count at all? It's hard to understand how it benefits the GOP to follow this line of argument where it inevitably leads; there are obviously plenty of blended families, however you define the term, on both sides of the aisle, and caretaking is one of the great acts of love (and not limited to parenting). And yet, here we are. Presumably, in part, because this criticism is so easy, and so familiar. Last month, Newsweek ran an op-ed that argued Taylor Swift is a bad role model for girls because at 34 she remains unmarried and child-free. Nor is this critique limited to real-life people; who can forget Ben Shapiro burning a Barbie doll in effigy last summer because he was angry at the \"wokeness\" of a story that sidelined Ken? Pitting women with children against women who don't have them is hardly the purview of the GOP. Even left-leaning websites know that doing so is a guaranteed traffic bonanza. Which is not a surprise in a world where our narratives around both roles remain so limited and our support systems around child rearing so punishing for women. And yet, this argument rests on the foundational belief that one must experience something directly to have any say over it. (And if we're going to implement this as the basis for who gets to be in charge, it will immediately disqualify all men from making decisions over women's bodies -- arguably not the worst outcome.) At its core, though, this thinking denies the very thing that makes us most human: our empathy. The ability to put ourselves in another's shoes is not just the golden rule, it is a fundamental necessity to democracy. But, of course, whether or not Harris is a parent, or how she parents, is not the GOP's real issue. The real issue is that the GOP wants to exert control over every aspect of women's lives, beginning with their bodies. The Dobbs decision was the beginning, but it is far from where they hope to take us. The Project 2025 manifesto wants to eliminate coverage of emergency contraception. Vance, himself, has said he's in favor of a national abortion ban. And there is an increasing push on the right to roll back no-fault divorce . Harris represents an idea of womanhood that flies in the face of all this. One that is increasingly popular according to statistics. Marriage rates are dropping globally, and people are having fewer children. As for being miserable, studies show single women may be the happiest among us. Harris did not marry until she was 49. She's had an enormously successful career, despite not having prioritized marriage or children. It certainly doesn't hurt that she almost always appears to be enjoying herself, perhaps never more so than when grilling Justice Brett Kavanaugh. For most of her life Harris has succeeded outside of both the things we are told make women successful and worthy: marriage and motherhood. Which, as we know, are also the two things, in this country at least, that punish women the most financially. She is proof, in other words, of other, satisfying, ways for women to be. Ways to be that might also offer a path to the most powerful position in America. Cats or otherwise. Glynnis MacNicol is a writer and a podcast host.

      "President-elect Donald Trump hasn't even taken office, and congressional Republicans are already taking cues from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy and the pair's new playground, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. GOP lawmakers immediately lined up against the original short-term government funding bill released this week after Musk voiced his opposition . On top of that, a group of extremist Republicans, led by Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Andy Harris, is fighting to ensure that the fresh round of tax cuts Republicans have planned for Musk when Trump's 2017 tax law expires are paid for with $2.5 trillion in spending cuts on programs Americans rely on chosen by -- you guessed it -- Musk. Republicans have made their plan for the new year crystal clear: Ram through massive tax giveaways for the ultra-wealthy and corporations, and pay for them by shaking down programs and agencies that working families rely on. And they're putting unelected and unaccountable oligarchs -- Musk and Ramaswamy -- in charge of deciding how much pain Americans will have to tolerate so that the rich can get richer. Contrary to Musk and Ramaswamy's claims that DOGE will put money back in taxpayers' pockets, nothing laid out in DOGE's scattershot plans shows any serious understanding of improving efficacy and efficiency. Rather, it's just the latest iteration of conservatives' decades-long crusade to, as Grover Norquist famously said, reduce government \"to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub \" -- combined with their perennial obsession to cut Social Security benefits for seniors. We've seen this before. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan spearheaded the Grace Commission to cut federal spending. The committee put together more than 2,500 recommendations, but virtually none of them were taken up. This isn't even the first time Trump himself has tried this scheme. During his first term, he tapped billionaire Carl Icahn to tackle government inefficiencies. Icahn lasted seven months before resigning for allegedly rewriting regulations to benefit his Texas-owned oil refinery. And now, Musk and Ramaswamy are being given free reign to decide what programs they can cut to fund their own tax cuts, all while Musk himself benefits from billions in government subsidies . DOGE is quickly becoming the GOP's political cover to blow a hole through the budget while tearing down popular safety net programs they've crusaded against for decades. It doesn't take much more than simple math to realize that DOGE's empty promise to curb government inefficiencies by cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget is nearly impossible without going after Medicare and Social Security given the way our federal budget is actually allocated. In fact, while Trump studiously avoided supporting unpopular policies like cutting Social Security during his 2024 campaign, Musk, Ramaswamy, and DOGE's unofficial think tank, the ultra-conservative Cato Institute, are already planning to \"shrink Social Security,\" slash benefits, cut the Social Security cost-of-living adjustments that ensure seniors' benefits keep pace with inflation, raise the retirement age, and more, according to the plans laid out in Cato's DOGE manifesto . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle can agree that there are many tax-funded tools Americans rely on that need improvement. If DOGE truly existed to improve government efficiency and cut wasteful spending, they would of course start by recommending that Trump hold off on another round of costly tax cuts for the wealthy. They would also advocate for a better-funded IRS to continue its efforts to collect billions of dollars from tax cheats and expand the hugely popular Direct File program to help more people file for free. In fact, they could even meet the public where they are and recommend raising taxes on the ultra-wealthy to pay for priorities like education, health care, and Social Security -- some of the federal government's biggest ticket items. But that's not the point of DOGE. Instead, if Republicans get their way, we could end up with no health care for veterans , no Medicare , and no Social Security , while the members of Trump's billionaire boys club rake in tax handouts paid for by teachers, nurses, and firefighters. Here's the good news: Like the commissions of Christmas past, Musk and Ramaswamy are setting themselves up for failure. Americans can see this scam for what it is. Polling shows the commission is already underwater among Americans . They know that once Musk and Ramaswamy's checks clear, they're going to turn around and try to tell Americans that we can no longer afford to cover their Medicare. Americans know that we could have the best schools, hospitals, and roads in the world if conservatives weren't constantly doling out tax giveaways to the ultra-rich and starving our communities of resources, which is why four in five Americans support raising taxes on the rich. Working families don't need a pair of ultra-rich tech bros to tell us where their priorities lie. When Musk and Ramaswamy fail to come up with a plan to make life easier and more affordable for working people, they'll do what ultra-wealthy scammers do best: drop everything and move on to their next grift. Let's just make sure they don't leave dangerous products, higher prices, and smaller paychecks in their wake.\n",

      "As one of the first Post-9/11 veterans , I faced a stark choice from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) when I transitioned from military service to civilian life. While attending college, I could opt for the older, less generous Chapter 32 of the post-Vietnam era veterans' Montgomery G.I. Bill, or I could take advantage of the newer, more robust Chapter 33 post-9/11 veterans' G.I. Bill. With college prices much higher than the Vietnam Era, like many others, I chose the latter. But there was a catch: By selecting Chapter 33, I was forced to forfeit the first year of my Chapter 32 benefits. This condition, imposed on millions of veterans, effectively denied us thousands of dollars in educational support. This partly voided the military's guarantee of free education for military service. Even with this setback, the Chapter 33 benefits were superior -- so it was a tradeoff I, and many others, reluctantly accepted. For veterans who saw this as a grave injustice, there was one beacon of hope: James Rudisill. An Army veteran and FBI agent, Rudisill took legal action against the VA to challenge the forfeiture policy. His fight culminated in a Supreme Court decision last year ruling that the VA's actions were unlawful. The decision requires the VA to repay billions of dollars in benefits to eligible veterans -- and earlier this month, the VA announced earlier this month TKTK. This victory was a long time coming. However, it was not without resistance. The Trump administration, notorious for its attempts to slash the VA budget and federal spending, fought this case all the way to the Supreme Court . The case was originally filed as Rudisill v. Wilkie , for Trump's then VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Rudisill and veterans. The dissent came from two conservative justices: Clarence Thomas, who benefited from Yale Law School's financial aid, and Samuel Alito, an Army veteran. For veterans like me, who have been burdened with student loan debt while waiting for justice, the ruling is bittersweet. I took out $30,000 in loans to cover the gap left by my forfeited benefits. Ten years later, I owe $31,000. Multiply that by the estimated million veterans affected, and the magnitude of this failure becomes clear. Despite this ruling, many veterans who took out student loans are still on the hook. Yet this ruling presents a significant challenge to Trump's campaign promises. He has vowed to cut trillions from the federal budget, including hundreds of millions from the VA. Paying back these benefits directly undermines his government-slashing agenda. So, will Trump comply with the Supreme Court's mandate? Based on Trump's track record of abiding by court orders, it's unlikely. This is the same Trump administration that has promised to gut the federal government under its Department of Government Efficiency or \" DOGE \" agenda -- a grift at best, a pump-and-dump crypto scheme at worst. to dismantle entire departments and weaken agencies like the VA. Trump's ability to sidestep accountability comes from a different Supreme Court ruling that he is immune from criminal liability for so-called official acts committed as president. Trump's disregard for legal and moral obligations to veterans is nothing new. His administration routinely prioritized \"cost-cutting\" over service members' well-being, whether by attempting to privatize the VA in his first term, delaying benefits claims, or ignoring the systemic issues plaguing veterans' health care. With this ruling, veterans stand to gain billions in owed benefits. But Trump's track record suggests he will fight tooth and nail to deny us what we have rightfully earned. For veterans, this is yet another battle in a long war for justice and adequate health care. The Supreme Court's decision is a step forward, but the fight is far from over. If Trump attempts to defy the payouts, as he has with so many others, it will be up to Congress and the American public to hold him accountable. We've served our country. Now it's time for the government to uphold its end of the bargain, no matter who sits in the Oval Office. Veterans shouldn't have to sue to receive what we were promised, and we certainly shouldn't have to fight a president who sees our sacrifices as just another line item to cut. The question isn't whether Trump will try to shaft veterans again. The question is whether we, as a nation, will let him. Michael Embrich is a veteran, former member of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans, and a former congressional staffer.\n"

      "Brat. Weird. Megan Thee Stallion. Democrats haven't just recast the lead at the top of their electoral ticket; they're performing an entirely new show. Right wing operatives, desperate to make silly selfies seem like evidence of -- gasp! -- socialism , are trying to claim this new politics of joy (and mockery) is proof of nefarious intent. This is either par for the \"every accusation is an admission\" MAGA Republican playbook or merely ironic. Creating good vibes isn't just generally effective, it's critical especially in what may seem the most counterintuitive cases: confronting existing or would-be authoritarian regimes, in other words, MAGA Republicans. Sami Gharbia once said, \"humor is the first step to break taboos and fears. Making people laugh about dangerous stuff like dictatorship, repression, censorship is a first weapon against those fears... without beating fear you can not make any change.\" The lure of the authoritarian is that he is the Strongman, as Ruth Ben Ghiat has sagely written . Like his peers, Donald Trump promises to fight the forces of chaos, restoring the \"rightful\" place of the \"real citizens\" who have been usurped by some undeserving \"other.\" Indeed, he promises to elevate the nation as a whole on the world stage, to make it \"great again.\" The audition tape of the would-be-dictator is of alpha male vying for the role of making things happen. Bringing dictators down to size, making them seem vincible, has been integral to their defeat across places and time periods. Bugs Bunny and Charlie Chaplin ridiculed Adolf Hitler. Otpor !, a movement started by 15 university students, toppled the tyrannical Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia by making fun of him, at extraordinary peril. Augusto Pinochet's regime came to an end in part thanks to rainbows. This was the emblem of the campaign to have Chileans risk reprisal from his regime, known for disappearing detractors, in order to vote to block him from running for another term. With late 80s charm, their anthem declared \"Chile, happiness is coming.\" Political Scientist M. Steven Fish sums up liberal leaders' challenges in responding to similar present day figures: \"Rather than exude iron self-assurance and unqualified optimism about their countries' futures, liberals fret about the complexities of governing and social problems... They treasure norms of civility and distrust provocative, aggressive language. Generally speaking, then, they have adopted what I call a low-dominance political style.\" Fish goes on to praise high dominance Democrats who break this mold: Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) who has made an artform of eviscerating her MAGA House colleagues; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Enter into this all-woman pantheon, Kamala Harris . A recent press release now going viral from Team Harris-Walz merits an A plus for trolling the opposition down to conquerable size. Announcing an upcoming Trump campaign stop, it reads, \"Donald Trump to Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home.\" It goes on to remind readers who Trump is: \"loser of the 2020 election by 7 million votes.\" Harris seems to relish in equal parts roasting her opponent and line dancing among her supporters. No longer Les Miserables, Harris-Walz have moved us onto Mamma Mia. And Democratic activists, plus previously disaffected base voters, are now loving the dancing queen. This comes just in time because, as her vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, rightly declared , \"I know I am preaching to the choir. A damn big and beautiful choir. But practice is over, people, the choir needs to sing.\" Malarkey aside, the Biden campaign was a largely serious affair. The stump speech pre-debate was punctuated with policy achievements, second term plans, and reminders that \"we're in a battle for the soul of America.\" Post debate, the anti-Trump flames burned higher, but still in public appearances, social media content, and surrogate sentiments, Biden ran on gravitas. To be sure, Dark Brandon made occasional appearances. But that, as my high school Spanish teacher would say, is proof that the exceptions confirm the rules. If Biden's primary campaign persona was less staid, partisans would not have needed an alter-ego to bring in the fun. Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, in contrast, are awash in memes -- from coconut trees to Midwestern dadisms -- and irony-laced clapbacks . People are lining up in the summer heat to see this new production. Like clockwork, the punditocracy has begun to chide Team Dem for having too good a time vibing with voters. Of course, it's not expressed as such. They want her to prioritize holding media interviews and offering policy specifics. The Washington Post declared , \"Twenty-four days ago, Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to campaign staff to together 'take our case to the American people.' Less than a month, that case remains somewhat murky, at least in terms of policy -- and that has become the chief knock on the Harris campaign.\" While it's absolutely reasonable to want anyone vying to run our country to tell us a bit more about what they have in store, the notion that staid articulation of policy is integral to electoral success , as claimed recently in The New York Times , merits Harris' trademark guffaw. American voters are famously moved by policy proposals; this is why we had such a wildly successful President Elizabeth Warren. Yet, the long held \" median voter theorem \" of elections posits voters as rational actors that exist along a single ideological continuum with fixed preferences, impervious to persuasion, in a static electorate where the very same people turn out every time. Under this logic, candidates are best served positioning themselves at the \"median,\" thereby closer to the greatest number of voters. This idea has reappeared by many names, \"triangulation,\" centrism, and most recently Popularism . Indeed, this latest permutation argues that a winning candidate must tout policy prescriptions that majorities favor and eschew, or at least not bring up others . And sure, that feels like super logical advice -- support things people like and they will like you! But the notion that voters are studying policy positions to come to their preferences belies what we know of how humans come to judgments and what it takes to get a message to actually reach their ears. Unless the choir wants to sing your tune, the congregation won't hear the joyful noise and get off the couch to vote, let alone spread the word to potential new believers. As I have advised campaigns for over a decade, if you want people to come to your party, throw a better party. People may say that their top electoral issue is \"the economy\" or whatever permutation of it you use in your question wording. (Spoiler alert: the plurality always selects that option.) But in reality, people can only tell us what they think that they think. Of course economic concerns are primary for most people; but evidence shows that what voters claim tops their issue list doesn't actually impact their voting behavior. Further, what breaks through to the average voter about elections aren't detailed policy platforms. Elections are made out of grand narratives -- storylines that make clear precisely what harms the antagonists have in store and imbue the protagonists -- by which I mean the voters -- with the agency to select the future they would like. And while this does not come up in issue polling, most people would like that future to be a good time. Famous for her unbridled laughter, Harris' campaign has embraced the politics of joy. Not in ignorance of the foe she faces, who is hell bent on taking our freedoms, harming our families, and imperiling our futures. But in full awareness of what it takes to defeat him.

      "Earlier this week, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European Union-funded research group, announced that last Sunday, July 21, 2024, the daily global average temperature hit 62.76 degrees. It was the hottest day scientists have measured since 1940 -- which officially makes it the hottest day ever recorded on Earth by humans. Twenty four hours later, however, Copernicus had to update its report: On Monday, the temperature climbed up to 62.87 degrees. As of now, July 22, 2024 is now the hottest day ever recorded. But hey, it's only Friday. Who knows what the weekend holds? Or the rest of the summer, for that matter. Are you shocked by news of this record-breaking heat? Does the fact that you lived through two of the hottest days on Earth that scientists have ever recorded make you think differently about the risks and consequences of living on a rapidly-warming planet? Did you pause for a moment and think about the millions of people who sweat through this without air conditioning? Did you mourn the 396 deaths from heat that are under investigation this summer in Phoenix? Did you sell your car and buy an electric bike? Were you inspired to sign up to knock on doors to help Kamala Harris defeat the climate-hoax-pushing-criminal Donald Trump? Are you getting calls from your MAGA-loving uncle in Idaho apologizing for the long lecture he gave you at Thanksgiving last year about how Earth's temperature moves in natural cycles, or about how higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is good because more CO2 makes crops and trees grow better? Probably not. The problem is not you. The problem is that a broken heat record is just another statistic. The story of the climate crisis is written in broken records that measure levels of CO2 pollution, glacial ice melt, rising sea levels, crop failure, megafires, the spread of diseases, heat deaths, wildfire and insurance costs, and economic losses. But if shocking data and broken records could galvanize people to take action on climate, we'd all be powering our iPhones with solar power from microgrids, and millions of cows and chickens would be liberated from factory farms. We'd have cities crowded with bike lanes and a high speed rail service between Dallas and Houston. We'd laugh at climate-hoaxing politicians and debate whether it is fair and just to charge Big Oil companies with criminally negligent homicide. But that hasn't happened. Or it's not happening fast enough. Why? Well, I'm a journalist, not a political scientist, psychologist, or expert in social activism (for more about that, check out Dana Fisher's new book Saving Ourselves: From Climate Shocks to Climate Action ). But for what it's worth, here's how I'd explain it. First, nobody cares about numbers. They care about stories. They care about emotion. They care about life, death, hope, dreams. And money. A heat statistic is not a visceral thing. It is a data point. And thanks to years of strategic targeting of trusted media and scientific institutions by far-right autocrats everywhere, we live in a world that increasingly distrusts data points. Where is the line between fake news and fake data? On social media platforms, it's easy to find climate deniers claiming that temperature monitoring stations are all located in hot places on airport runways or in sun-baked parking lots, suggesting that there is some grand conspiracy to crank up the temperature readings so that George Soros can control the world and force you to sell your jacked-up 4-wheeler and grill crickets instead of hamburgers at your next summer BBQ. One of the reasons I titled my book The Heat Will Kill You First is that I wanted to transform heat into a visceral thing. I wanted to tell readers a story about what happens inside the human body during a heatstroke. How heat cells melts and proteins unravel. And how it is not just old ladies with heart conditions or migrant farmworkers who heat kills. It can happen to you, if you are stuck in the wrong place or make a miscalculation on a hot day. The second problem with record-breaking statistics has to do with shifting baselines. For anyone who is half-awake, the idea of climate crisis is not new. It's baked into our thinking about the world we live in. It's hard to jolt anyone out of that, especially with a statistic or a headline. But an even bigger threat is the way we habituate to climate chaos. Instead of being shocked by a brutal heat dome, or a devastating wildfire, we just accept that is what world is like now. I live in Austin, which had 42 days last summer above 105 degrees. It was shocking and brutal. But the response from many Texans was, \"Yeah, it's always hot in Texas.\" No statistic was going to change their view about that. People come to believe that that heat waves that cook cities are just the way that nature works. In some ways, this is the dark side of climate adaptation. We adapt by learning to live with it. Air pollution from fossil fuels kills about five million people every year. But those deaths are largely (and tragically) background noise. It has just become part of life in the 21st century. A similar thing is happening with the climate crisis. Floods, megafires, heat domes -- it will all become just a part of the way the world works now. Not only do we lose our outrage. But we lose any sense that this climate chaos is an entirely human artifact, a real as the Great Pyramid of Giza. And finally, it's time to admit that for the rising tide of autocrats around the world, climate chaos is a feature, not a bug. Trump's ascendency depends on chaos. It gives him a reason to build more walls, lock up more migrants, and suck up more money from Big Oil. For Trump and his autocratic pals, this is a no brainer. Solving climate change is like setting a throttle limit on the engine that drives your voters to the polls. All this is not to say that living through two of the hottest days in recorded human history is not a big deal. It is. These are dangerous times, and not just because democracy is on the ballot in November. The very stability of the climate that gives us life is also on the line. What is needed most right now is not a \"solution\" for the climate crisis, but the courage for a long fight. As Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson, one of the founders of Earth Day, put it more than 50 years ago: \"The battle to restore a proper relationship between man and his environment, and between man and other living creatures, will require a long, sustained political, moral, ethical, and financial commitment far beyond any commitment made by any society in this history of man. Are we able? Yes. Are we willing?That's the unanswered question.\"\n"

      "While Elon Musk was striking it rich as a guest in America, the rest of our worlds were crashing down. I was serving in my first year of Active Duty Military Service. While home on leave -- a little longer than intended -- I remember watching the first tower fall from my uncle's home in Bayonne, N.J. The smoke rising from Lower Manhattan was visible across the water, an unthinkable sight that would change the course of history and my life forever. While I watched in horror, John Feal was already in motion. A demolition supervisor, he did what so many first responders and volunteers did that day -- he ran toward the devastation, determined to help. For days, along with his comrades, many of whom are dead from 9/11 -related illnesses, he worked tirelessly on \"the pile,\" the smoldering wreckage of the Twin Towers, searching for survivors, clearing debris, and breathing in air thick with toxic dust that he was told was \"safe.\" In 2008, fate brought John Feal and me together. I was working for a congressman, and John was hunting down lawmakers. My job was to intercept people like John -- relentless advocates demanding action. But John wasn't just any advocate. He told me about the horrific illnesses 9/11 first responders were suffering from and how the City of New York had abandoned them, offering no health care or support. I knew immediately this was something we needed to address. I introduced John to my boss, and from that moment on, he never stopped fighting. For the next 11 years, John battled in Washington, refusing to let politicians ignore the suffering of those who had risked everything on 9/11. With the help of his friends -- and the heartbreaking loss of too many others -- he eventually forced Congress to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, and renew the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund later. Even when Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee blocked a unanimous-consent motion, John pushed forward, ensuring that responders got the care they deserved. Now, Elon Musk thinks John Feal and his dying friends should go without the health care they need. Musk, along with President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have led a purge of federal workers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control; those cuts at the CDC, which manages the 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program, have left the system unable to process claims or even function. There's no bottom to the depths of Trump and Musk's indifference when it comes to the treatment of America's heroes -- veterans make up roughly a third of the federal workforce they are actively dismantling. But even for them, this is a new low. The job cuts at CDC eliminated 20 percent of the federal workers responsible for certifying 9/11-related illnesses, preventing fraud, and ensuring research continues. That means thousands of firefighters, police officers, construction workers, and volunteers could see delays or denials in their care. For many, those delays could mean the difference between life and death, as John knows all too well. Sound familiar? That's because Musk, Trump, and DOGE keep pulling the same stunt with veterans -- cutting their jobs, threatening vital services and saving taxpayers nothing . Their efforts at political gain come at the expense of sick 9/11 first responders and disabled veterans. When Abraham Lincoln said, \"To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan,\" he likely never imagined a future where America would be run by billionaires -- some of whom were never even elected. Yet here we are, with the richest men in the world telling the heroes who risked everything, watched their friends die from terrorism, disease, and war, that they refuse to care for them, their widows, or their children.\n",

      "Last week's Democratic convention was the crescendo of an unprecedented period in American history: The Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt, the Democratic president ended his reelection bid, and the vice president became her party's nominee without a single primary vote. But the summer was equally extraordinary for how it capped off the plot that we expose in The Lever' s new investigative series Master Plan -- a scheme to normalize and legalize corruption, transforming graft from a crime into the widely accepted way politics is now conducted. In just a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court 's billionaire - coddled justices made it legal for politicians to accept gifts from beneficiaries of government favors; Donald Trump promised to enrich fossil fuel industry donors in exchange for $1 billion in campaign donations, while his running mate J.D. Vance begged a tech billionaire to bankroll their campaign; moguls funneling cash to Democrats demanded the firing of the antitrust regulator scrutinizing their businesses ; both parties held corporate - sponsored conventions that prominently featured billionaires and CEOs as keynote speakers; and spending by Super PACs and other shadowy groups crossed the $1 billion mark. In an election purporting to be about the survival of the American Way Of LifeTM, this miasma of transactional cash is the real threat to democracy -- one harming us all. Money is why popular, desperately needed legislation rarely ever passes -- it is why both parties colluded to kill off a minimum wage increase; why Americans have no guaranteed right to medical care; why oil companies are permitted to incinerate the climate; and why corporations are allowed to fleece us in myriad ways with no consequences. Money is why Trump has abandoned much of the anti-corporate rhetoric that once distinguished him as a heterodox conservative, and almost certainly why he has reversed himself on key policies of interest to a new crop of donors . Money is why Vice President Kamala Harris seems more comfortable avoiding press attention and running on vague platitudes rather than endorsing initiatives that might provoke the ire of well-funded Super PACs. Money is why Democratic leaders started telling reporters that even if Harris wins the election promising voters a crusade against corporate profiteering, her anti-price-gouging initiatives are dead on arrival in the next Congress. And money is why a new study shows most Democratic candidates up and down the ballot avoid explicitly criticizing corporations and billionaires -- the forces who are creating the problems that Democrats diagnose, but who will spend those Democrats into the ground if they make too much noise. Whatever your preferred label for this dystopia -- oligarchy, plutocracy, kleptocracy -- you might assume it is just a naturally occurring inevitability, but nothing could be further from the truth. This era of corruption -- in which elections are glorified auctions -- was manufactured by a cadre of oligarchs and operatives whose agenda could only be implemented by deregulating the campaign finance system so that cash could short circuit democracy. \"Political Power Is Necessary\" This untold story began a half century ago amid a golden age of democratic reforms. As America's government was responding to public discontent by creating Medicare, Medicaid, environmental regulation, and a war on poverty, a genteel tobacco industry lawyer authored a 1971 manifesto sounding an alarm. In his now-famous memo, the soon-to-be Supreme Court justice Lewis Powell cast corporations and oligarchs as persecuted victims, and urged them to use their outsized resources to assume \"a broader and more vigorous role in the political arena\" to halt a government becoming too responsive to popular demands. \"In terms of political influence with respect to the course of legislation and government action, the American business executive is truly the 'forgotten man,'\" Powell wrote. \"This is the lesson that political power is necessary; that such power must be assiduously cultivated; and that when necessary, it must be used aggressively and with determination -- without embarrassment.\" Some have cast Powell's blueprint as little more than a 1970s version of a meaningless Reddit rant rather than the foundational text that some liberals believe it to be. But if anything, the significance of Powell's screed has been understated. Documents unearthed by The Lever show that in response to the memo, leaders of the country's most powerful corporations organized task forces to implement its directives. One of their goals was deregulating the campaign finance system. Why? Because they understood that in a properly functioning one-person-one-vote democracy, they would never be able to gain control of the political system and enact their self-enriching, wealth-concentrating agenda. They knew that to get their way, they must be allowed to buy elections, legislation, court rulings, and public policy. And so in short order, corporations and moguls inspired by Powell began funding think tanks, political advocacy organizations, and conservative law firms -- and victories followed. First, with the support of conservative philanthropist John Olin's political machine, Congress quietly added loopholes to the post-Watergate anti-corruption laws allowing for the explosion of corporate political action committees that could buy legislators. Then in a lawsuit masterminded by American Enterprise Institute legal activists Ralph Winter and John Bolton (yes, that John Bolton!) -- and stealthily boosted by then-Solicitor General Robert Bork -- conservatives convinced the Supreme Court to endorse a radical legal doctrine equating money with constitutionally protected speech. Soon after, Powell successfully lobbied his fellow justices to extend those free speech rights to corporations aiming to spend big money to buy elections. These early wins unleashed a tidal wave of corporate money flooding into politics, which birthed an era of neoliberal tax, deregulatory, and anti-union policies, just as the master planners wanted. It also delivered an attendant epoch of corruption scandals, from Abscam , to the Keating Five , to Enron , to Jack Abramoff and the K Street Project . The throughline in each sordid episode was money being used to subvert democracy -- in specific, to pressure elected officials to use their power to enrich donors at the expense of voters. Not surprisingly, the influence-peddling imbroglios coincided with other spectacles of institutionalized corruption -- the insurance industry's political spending killed universal health care initiatives and replaced them with a system of government subsidies; the fossil fuel industry's political spending killed climate legislation and got the greenlight for record production ; and Wall Street's political spending killed New Deal regulations that might have prevented the financial crisis. With money politics ascending, wealth concentrated, government shrunk, the working class was pulverized, and corporations gained control. At the twilight of the 20th century, Powell's mission seemed on a glidepath. Reform And Then Collapse But amid this grotesquerie, some finally fought back -- most prominently and unexpectedly, a scandal-plagued John McCain. After being humiliated as one of the Keating Five who pressured federal banking regulators on behalf of a donor, the Arizona senator adopted the zeal of a convert to the anti-corruption cause. He waged a yearslong battle for legislation to restrict unlimited corporate spending on politics, eventually using an insurgent presidential bid to shame George W. Bush -- the personification of Big Money politics -- into signing the first campaign finance reform law in a generation. But while the Supreme Court briefly upheld that legislation in 2003, it was a short-lived respite. The Powell Memo had urged corporations and business leaders to fund political infrastructure focused on changing the judiciary. When the seats of Justices William Rehnqist and Sandra Day O'Connor opened up in 2005, that well-financed machine made sure the Bush administration replaced them not with moderates, but with archconservatives committed to the master plan. Led by the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo , the conservative legal movement ran a multimillion-dollar campaign to install archconservative John Roberts. The same master planners then ran a campaign to convince Senate Republicans to block potential moderate nominee Harriet Miers, prompting Bush to replace her with the far-right Samuel Alito. In the wake of the duo's confirmations, liberals consoled themselves with hopes that the seemingly reasonable Justice Anthony Kennedy would maintain a pragmatic equilibrium on the high court. Kennedy, though, was much like his predecessor, Powell. He cut a moderate profile, but had long been an opponent of tough campaign finance and anti-corruption laws -- hardly surprising considering his early career was spent as a corporate lobbyist doling out cash to lawmakers, and as an author of Ronald Reagan's first anti-tax ballot measure in the Powell Memo years. And so when one of this generation's most effective campaign finance deregulators, attorney James Bopp, manufactured a case about a Hillary Clinton documentary, the master plan sprung into action. Rather than crafting a narrow decision, Roberts ordered the case to be reargued on more precedential questions and then assigned the opinion to Kennedy, who authored the expansive 2010 Citizens United ruling that overturned McCain's campaign finance law. Building directly off Powell's earlier ruling on corporate speech, the decision fully legalized unlimited spending in elections, insisting that putatively independent expenditures \"do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\" As election spending by billionaires and corporations subsequently skyrocketed , the same legal machine forged by the Powell Memo manufactured cases designed to prompt the court to deliver additional rulings encouraging even more corruption. In one such case, conservative justices shamelessly used a mid-20th-century court ruling that protected civil rights groups from Jim Crow thugs to protect billionaire- and corporate-funded dark money groups from disclosing their donors to regulators responsible for enforcing nonprofit laws. Another string of high court rulings then overturned law enforcement officials' corruption convictions and gutted longstanding federal bribery statutes. As for the government's remaining anti-corruption regulators, the master planners made sure they were also defanged: Republicans packed the Federal Election Commission with appointees opposed to enforcing even the most minimal campaign finance laws, and they have bullied the Internal Revenue Service out of policing dark money groups. \"It Doesn't Have Any Effect On Me\" In the wake of this rampage, master planners today typically argue that everything is fine and democracy is safe, because money supposedly does not buy election results. They cite the occasional outspent election winner or overspending election loser as proof that cash does not determine political outcomes. But those are rare exceptions in a country where those who spend the most are able to most repetitiously communicate with voters -- and therefore almost always win. And that money almost always comes with big donors' transactional expectations. \"People say, 'Oh, it doesn't have any effect on me,'\" said now-retired Rep. Barney Frank in a candid interview a few years after Citizens United . \"Well if that were the case, we'd be the only human beings in the history of the world who on a regular basis took significant amounts of money from perfect strangers and made sure that it had no effect on our behavior.\" Data about legislative action buttresses Frank's point. One study found that for every $1 of corporate donations, a business gets more than $6 of state tax breaks. Another study found a correlation between unlimited campaign spending and a reduction in corporate taxes. Still another study found that the more freely corporations are allowed to spend in elections, the more likely lawmakers are to pass laws that protect corporate management. The same holds true for legislative and political inaction. Health insurers' cash explains why Americans have no guaranteed right to medical care, and pharmaceutical industry cash explains why we continue to pay the world's highest prices for medicine. Wall Street cash explains why private equity tax loopholes that could be closed with the stroke of a pen remain open, and why bankers who cratered the global economy continued to reap bailouts rather than prosecutions. Rail industry cash explains why Congress has refused to pass rail safety legislation after the East Palestine disaster, and Boeing cash explains why the company gets a slap on the wrist and even more government contracts after its deadly crashes. The list of such examples is endless, ultimately confirming Princeton and Northwestern researchers' conclusion : \"Economic elites and organized interest groups play a substantial part in affecting public policy, but the general public has little or no independent influence\" over the government operating in its name. Even worse, an electorate pining for reform is typically given few political choices that promise any escape from it. The 2024 campaign exemplifies the sad reality. On one side is the choice are policy-free vibes that pretend working-class voters' and elite donors' conflicting interests can both coexist under the same big tent. On the other side is a 900-page manifesto promising an explicit corporate takeover and final gutting of whatever's left of campaign finance laws -- all written by a group whose seed funding was originally prompted by the Powell Memo. \"The Election Of Federal Officials Is Not A Private Affair\" In the two years it has taken to report out Master Plan , our reporters discovered documents illustrating just how deliberate the attack has been on America's anti-corruption and campaign finance laws. Beholding a never-before-unearthed 1971 photo of Philip Morris' CEO giving Powell a judicial robe emblazoned with corporate logos, you can't help but see the image as a prophecy of all that would come to pass. And yet even as we live in Powell's world and democracy teeters amid this year's multibillion-dollar election extravaganza, there is a silver lining: The fact that this present reality came from a plan means it can be reversed, especially because the solutions are so obvious and straightforward. First and foremost, every political jurisdiction can pass laws forcing the disclosure of those who spend money to influence elections and policy. States have already started doing this , and the federal government could, too. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has already written the DISCLOSE Act, which was co-sponsored by Harris , who as California attorney general tried to force dark money groups to disclose their donors. In 2025, she could be in a position to make a disclosure bill the law of the land. This shouldn't be a partisan or ideological issue: After all, the Citizens United decision explicitly touted the necessity of robust transparency, and even ultraconservative Justice Antonin Scalia agreed with such notions, writing in a separate case that \"requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.\" Beyond transparency, there is what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had the temerity to bellow at the Democratic convention's corporate suites. \"Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections,\" he said in his keynote address last week. \"For the sake of our democracy, we must overturn the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and move toward public funding of elections.\" Immediately after Sanders made that demand, the DNC handed the microphone to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who bragged about being a billionaire , and then to the chairman of a venture capital firm for a speech insisting that Harris will be \"both pro-business and pro-worker\" -- as if there never needs to be a choice between the two. It was a scheduling juxtaposition that undoubtedly reassured the convention's corporate sponsors that (to use Joe Biden's donor-speak) nothing will fundamentally change . But it should. Overturning Citizens United will be a slow constitutional amendment process -- but one that's already making progress , and could over time generate some bipartisan support . The latter is already happening in states and cities across the country. It may seem like a pipe dream at the federal level, but remember: The idea twice came within a hair of happening in response to corruption scandals that rocked Washington. \"The election of federal officials is not a private affair. It is the foundation of our government,\" said the Senate report that accompanied the chamber's passage of a public financing bill in the mid-1970s. \"We shall not finally come to grips with the problems except as we are prepared to pay for the public business of elections with public funds.\" By today's standards, such a clear statement from Congress's upper chamber seems unfathomable -- but it didn't happen because senators were more altruistic back then. They came so close to game-changing anti-corruption reform because the public was so enraged by the Watergate scandal that their representatives felt the need to try to act. Watching convention-goers stroll the United Center halls and barely notice the corporate brands advertising their ownership of the Democratic Party, it is difficult to know if such rage can be mustered anymore. Even as today's corruption makes the scandals of the 1970s seem quaint, such disgust seems absent from an electorate inured to the dominance of money politics. Whereas the Watergate scandal prompted the first major campaign finance reforms of the 20th century, and the fundraising excesses of the 1980s and 1990s prompted McCain's crusade against the master plan, today's corruption seems on the verge of becoming like the water in David Foster Wallace's parable about fish -- many are so accustomed to swimming in it, they have stopped noticing it. Worse, some even demand contrition from those who dare to identify it as a problem. In 2020, there was Sanders feeling compelled to apologize for a surrogate invoking the word \"corruption\" when rightly criticizing Joe Biden's all-too-close relationship with corporate donors. In 2024, there was Rep. Katie Porter being vilified for pointing out that billionaires spent millions to \"rig\" her primary contest. As this election season heads into its final two months and produces a new president, there will be even more such pressure to keep quiet, conform, and insist on repentance from those who dare mention the corruption that America is drowning in. Succumbing to that code of silence is exactly what the master planners want -- and exactly what will end whatever's left of democracy.\n"

      "As I have predicted in previous columns for Rolling Stone , the Trump administration will shatter the lives and livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans . It's already happening, and we're only in the first week of his second term. Veterans have long relied on the federal government as a pathway to stable employment after military service. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies provide not just jobs, but purpose -- continuing the mission of serving fellow service members and ensuring that those who sacrificed for their country are cared for. But now, thanks to Trump's reckless 90-day federal hiring freeze , that lifeline is gone. The very veterans he once claimed to champion are being left in the cold, their futures uncertain. I'm part of a Facebook group called Veterans 2 Federal Jobs , a community where veterans help one another navigate the complex federal hiring process. Over the years, I've seen this group lift up thousands of veterans, providing guidance, encouragement, and resources. But since Trump's executive order was signed, the tone has changed dramatically. Instead of sharing success stories and interview tips, the group is now flooded with messages of dread, anxiety, PTSD flare-ups, and outright desperation. Hundreds of messages have poured in. Some veterans are looking for help, others are simply venting their despair. Many had promising federal careers lined up -- only to have the rug pulled out from under them. Dre Joseph, a veteran in the group, shared three rejection letters he received from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's hiring hub: \"Dear Mr. Joseph, As directed by President Trump on January 20, 2025, via Presidential Memorandum (PM) entitled 'Hiring Freeze,' we regret to inform you this recruitment is cancelled. If an exemption is approved for this recruitment, you may be notified; otherwise, any future opportunities will be advertised on VA Careers and USAJOBS.\" The same message followed for his other two applications. Three federal job opportunities gone in an instant. And he's not alone. Another veteran posted: \"Well, my interview for a position with DoD just got canceled. Recruitment Cancelled due to Federal Hiring Freeze: Supervisory Management & Program Analyst (Announcement Number: CBFF-12545121-24-CLV).\" These aren't just numbers or statistics. These are real people who served their country -- some for decades -- now being told that their service, their sacrifice, means nothing to the Trump administration. The hiring freeze doesn't just hurt veterans looking for jobs; it also threatens the quality of care they receive. The VA is already understaffed, facing a $6.6 billion budget shortfall by the end of fiscal year 2025. Medical professionals, crisis hotline responders, and claims processors are desperately needed to keep the VA running. Now, with hiring frozen, those vacancies will remain unfilled. That means doctors, nurses, and mental health professionals -- already stretched thin -- will be unable to keep up with demand. The consequences will be catastrophic. Veterans will wait longer for care, disability claims will pile up, and crisis lines -- lifelines for veterans on the brink -- will be understaffed. For veterans battling PTSD, depression, or suicidal thoughts, delays in care aren't just an inconvenience -- they're a death sentence. For disabled veterans, the hiring freeze is an even deeper betrayal. Many depend on federal employment opportunities because their disabilities make it difficult to work in the private sector. Programs like the Schedule A hiring authority and the Veterans' Preference system have historically provided a pathway to meaningful employment that accommodates their medical needs. By freezing hiring, Trump is cutting off a vital source of stability for those who need it most. These veterans -- many already struggling with chronic pain, PTSD, and mobility impairments -- now face even greater uncertainty. The very system designed to support them is instead shutting them out of employment and the economic security it provides. Adding to this harm, Trump also rescinded Executive Order 11246 , signed by President Johnson in 1965, which required government contractors to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, and other employment practices for women and people of color. This rollback disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, including the 30 percent of veteran applicants who would have benefited from these protections. For all his grandstanding about supporting the troops, Trump's actions tell a different story. With this hiring freeze, Trump is actively harming veterans in real time. The administration claims the freeze is a \"prudent step\" to assess federal employment, but let's be clear: this is a manufactured crisis. The VA has struggled with staffing shortages for years, and a hiring freeze doesn't fix anything -- it only makes the problem worse. The median time to fill a federal position is around 100 days, meaning Trump's hiring freeze will keep veterans locked out of federal employment for much of the year. Worse still, the VA will be forced to put veteran care on the backburner until at least 2026 if the freeze is lifted. Adding to the concern, Trump's own guidance on the freeze makes it clear that hiring is unlikely to resume anytime soon. The memorandum directs agencies to \"submit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\" In other words, the administration isn't just pausing hiring -- it's laying the groundwork to shrink the federal workforce permanently, leaving veterans without the support and opportunities they need. The freeze is just the latest in a long line of betrayals of America's veterans. Conveniently, the hiring freeze does not apply to Trump's White House.\n",

      "Elon Musk , the world's richest man, is taking a chainsaw to the US government and, at first glance, no one is standing in his way. Musk and his rogue's gallery of minions are moving fast, dead set on breaking the things that hundreds of millions of people in this country rely on for clean air, water, and food. For healthcare, retirement benefits, and much more. They hit the ground on Day One , doing their very best to remove any checks on their power. You'd be forgiven for feeling powerless, but you'd be wrong. Believing that you can do something, that together we all can, is the flotation device that can keep you from sinking into the politics of despair, of shock and paralysis. I'm writing this to put some air in your vest and let you know you have the opportunity to fight back. Getting out into the street, protesting, and making your voice heard matters. An activated citizenry is a primary driver of getting shit done. In nearly every case, it's the reason we have anything to protect from Elon Musk and his wrecking crew in the first place. On Monday, Feb. 10, the fearless and brilliant sociologist Joan Donovan made a simple post on Bluesky: \"Come out and participate in an international picket #TeslaTakeover locally. Stand up and be counted!\" I'd met Donovan when I was touring for my documentary about the role of YouTube in the rise of the far-right, and I like the idea of Tesla store protests , so I sent her a direct message asking if I could do some organizing to help drive turnout. She said yes, and I immediately cleared time from my day and got busy. First, I reached out to organizers and allies I've met in the 15 years that I've been trying to raise the alarm about the rising power of Silicon Valley oligarchs. Next, I made a quick database and sign-up form using online tools. Then I posted it all to Bluesky. And that was it. What I assumed would be a relatively small, one day event. I showed up to the Tesla showroom on Feb. 15, half-an-hour before the scheduled start of the demonstration, and expected to see just a handful of friends. There were already over 80 people there. And thousands of people all over the country had signed on to the Tesla Takedown page I'd made. That first day, there were peaceful demonstrations at 50 Tesla locations in the US. Some were extremely small but even those were effective. A single protester in Manhattan was able to close down a showroom by standing outside with a sign and engaging with customers and passersby. Three people outside a showroom in Minnesota made it on multiple nightly news broadcasts, spreading their message to millions of people across the Midwest. There have now been protests outside of Tesla locations in over 100 cities, and the movement is picking up speed and going global. Our website has thousands of visitors a day, signing on for protests, creating their own and downloading our resources. Just as many people are showing up in front of Tesla real estate through entirely separate organizations, like Indivisible and a new formation of rank and file federal workers called the Federal Unionists Network . Another massive day of action is planned this weekend. There are reports that Tesla's shareholders are already souring on the company's CEO and chairperson. The stock is dipping . You might be saying: sure, but haven't we done this all before? Didn't people come out into the streets by the millions during the first Trump administration, and didn't we end up right where we are now, anyway? Haven't we seen a decade of decentralized mass demonstrations organized online give way to the inevitable backlash, all around the world? I'd answer yes, and that those earlier demonstrations were transformative. The pink hats, BLM, #Resistance, and other mass public formations all contributed instrumentally to removing Trump from office last time. We know it is possible, we can do it again, and we can do it better. Trump and company learned from that experience, but so have we. The fight continues. This time around, we have advantages that we can build upon. First of all, there is Bluesky. Unlike X and Meta's platforms, Bluesky is not owned by a reactionary oligarch. It has grown by fits and starts since Musk's Twitter takeover, and in the past two weeks has demonstrated that it can be an effective tool for organizing real world actions, in the way that Twitter and Facebook were at certain times in the past. Secondly, Musk's net worth is -- and has long been -- massively overvalued. He owns and runs several companies, but his wealth and claim to being \"the richest person in the world\" is tied up in Tesla, itself a company with a significantly inflated stock price. This is a bubble that has been waiting to pop, and we can be the needle. Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration and its prerogatives, because it would be a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power. And while leaving Tesla wouldn't deliver Musk to the poorhouse, it would go some way to undermining his image, the reputation as a brilliant engineer and businessman that has been cultivated and burnished for over a decade. It is the source of his clout. And it's another balloon that's ready to rupture. For those of you thinking this is an outsized aim for a homegrown people's protest, I argue that we have already succeeded in our most important objectives, which is (1) to be a vehicle to inform the public at a time when facts are hard to come by from much of our politicians and the corporate media and (2) to provide an opportunity for the people of this country to show that we can fight back. We need an alternative to watching things unravel from our couches, that inspires hope and shows that we still have the capacity to oppose those who want to tear the fabric of our society apart and extract their own benefit from the wreckage. #TeslaTakedown is a much needed point of real world convergence for those of us already convinced that Musk and Trump urgently need to be stopped, while offering us the opportunity to reach the millions who prefer to steer clear of political debate and tech critique. This pressure will continue to build and as it does we will learn and adapt. I hope you'll join us.\n"

      "Elon Musk and the Trump administration are attempting to dismantle the federal workforce and our intelligence agencies, but there's just one problem: federal employees and veterans aren't taking the bait. Despite repeated emails, misleading promises, and thinly veiled threats, the so-called \"deferred resignation\" program is flopping. Instead of persuading career civil servants to abandon their posts, Musk's latest scheme is exposing the administration's desperation and legal recklessness. Less than 1 percent of federal workers have taken the offer. The recent legal filing by the American Federation of Government Employees and two federal employees seeking a restraining order against Musk's DOGE further hampers Musk's plans. In the end, this debacle will likely cost the federal government more in legal fees, settlements, and billable legal hours than ever. Musk, now leading the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- which is neither a federal agency nor a legally recognized federal advisory committee -- has no legitimate authority , as it was not established by Congress or lawfully by the president. Despite this, he has sent out multiple \"Fork in the Road\" emails, mirroring his infamous layoffs at X, formerly Twitter. The message is clear: take a buyout now and get paid through September, or risk being fired or furloughed later. The tens of thousands of veterans who transitioned to government service after their military careers know the law. The government cannot pay a federal worker for work they did not perform unless Congress specifically authorizes it. That would most likely take years. In any case, there is no guarantee that Congress would ever approve such funding, especially given the ongoing dysfunction, with Republicans struggling to fund their own government, draft a reconciliation bill, or elect a leader. Federal employees know their rights, and they recognize this scheme for what it is: an illegal power play riddled with political gamesmanship and destined for legal challenges. Attorneys general from 12 states have already warned workers about the risks of taking the resignation offer, calling it misleading and potentially illegal. Employment lawyers have pointed out that Congress, not the White House, controls federal paychecks, meaning any promise of severance payments could easily collapse in court. If Musk and Trump actually had the authority to fire these workers en masse, they wouldn't be trying so hard to scare them into leaving voluntarily. Musk's attempt to gut the federal workforce isn't just bad policy -- it's a direct attack on veterans. Nearly one-third of all federal employees are veterans and are concentrated in targeted agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency. Many of these veterans rely on their jobs to support their families and secure benefits they earned through service. Pushing them out under the guise of \"efficiency\" is a disgrace. This administration claims to support the troops, yet they're trying to force veterans out of government and onto uncertain ground. And let's not forget Musk's history of trampling laws. From defying SEC regulations to union-busting tactics at Tesla, he has never let legality get in the way of his whims. Now, he's trying to impose the same chaotic mismanagement on the U.S. government. But the government isn't a Silicon Valley startup full of college students eager to please their billionaire boss. Federal employees won't just roll over. Veterans and civil servants are accomplished professionals who have dedicated their lives to the Constitution of the United States of America. It's something Musk simply couldn't understand -- but that soon, he will. We are holding the line -- refusing to abandon our posts, refusing to be intimidated, and exposing this reckless power grab for what it is. We all took an oath to support and defend OUR Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That oath never expires. Musk wouldn't know. He never took it.\n",

      "This article was produced by Capital & Main. It is co-published by Rolling Stone with permission. It's a familiar story. After the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, there was national soul searching and protests, and racial justice suddenly became fashionable. Money that once had been a trickle flowed into racial equity and anti-racism efforts across the board, from corporate diversity, equity and inclusion programs to Black Lives Matter . Almost as quickly, the intensity of the epiphany began to fade as the public's attention was absorbed by the Covid pandemic and other, political crises. Predictably, the right wing stepped up its critiques of \"wokeism,\" especially calls to reallocate funding for police, pointing -- ironically -- to the street protests as proof of escalating crime that actually necessitated more police. While white backlash is part of the historic ebb and flow of the racial justice movement, the 2020 fallout is unique: Emboldened by the popularity of Trumpism and a right-leaning judicial system hostile to racial equity, conservatives are now seeking to defund racial justice itself. What this means is that in 2024, Black nonprofits say funders and foundations are in retreat. They are either reducing racial equity granting or watering down the language of Blackness and anti-racism or both. The fate of racial equity funding is at a serious crossroads -- an inflection point. Without money and, more importantly, without the public interest in equity, the battle for racial justice would continue, of course, but it would be severely marginalized, almost certainly set back. What the movement is facing is a giant wave of right-wing determination, aided by a string of favorable court actions in the last year or so, to not just defund but delegitimize advocacy for racial justice. Funders are fearful of legal repercussions, but fearful in a deeper, more existential way as the nation contemplates the political sea change of a second Trump term that feels more than possible. For Black nonprofits long vested in racial equity, the fight is not just to preserve dollars but to make sure donors don't lose their nerve, now or in the future. The shift away from funding equity calls for courage -- and counteraction. Earlier this year, at the behest of the Black Equity Collective , over 100 Black-led organizations signed an open letter to the philanthropic community, calling on it to not just stand firm in the face of the conservative onslaught, but to keep going. Kaci Patterson, founder of the Black Equity Collective, a partnership of funders and Black communities that funds Black-led projects in Southern California (full disclosure: This column is funded by a grant from the BEC), said nonprofits had been experiencing pullback from funders, resulting in reduced support she describes as \"mostly window dressing.\" Patterson was forced to revise her own budget mid-year, due to a $700,000 drop in funds that were pledged but didn't materialize. Both in the letter and in her daily work, Patterson is encouraging nervous funders not to modify the mission of Black justice, but to redouble their commitment to it. The letter urges funders to read and incorporate into their mission the recommendations released by California's Reparations Task Force, the first state reparations task force in the country. Taking such an unapologetically pro-Black stance carries risk, for foundations but more so for nonprofits. Patterson believes firmly that for nonprofits on the front lines of the movement for racial equity, there is no other choice. \"Do we fear losing money? Yes of course,\" she said. \"But we have to do this. The work isn't stopping.\" The stakes are higher than ever, because \"the right has more traction now than they've ever had,\" said Marc Philpart, executive director of the California Black Freedom Fund, a state initiative to support Black-led nonprofits. \"So we have to be intentional in telling the truth about power, injustice, how people are systematically trying to dismantle progress. The right's agenda is white supremacy and fascism. This is not just an attack on Black folks, it's an attack on democratic principles.\" Philpart sounds unusually blunt for someone in the social justice sphere, which tends to emphasize cooperation and visions of a shared good. But he said the moment leaves him no choice. We are very far from the hopeful moment four years ago, when many foundations acted almost as one to dramatically increase support for racial equity. Of course, that increase was not nearly enough. A 2023 survey of 25 community foundations by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy found that while funding of Black equity amongst those foundations increased by $125 million , much of it wasn't long term. Overall, only 2.4 percent of foundation budgets were spent on racial equity, even though that represented a doubling from 2016-18. Still, foundations were reporting a new, critical understanding about the importance of racial equity, one not captured by funding levels. \"We are finally willing to articulate and call out racism as a fundamental root cause of the opportunity gap,\" said one foundation leader interviewed in another study of racial equity granting published in 2022 by the Center for Effective Philanthropy. \"You can't talk about closing the opportunity gap without talking explicitly about race.\" But that new certainty started to waver after the conservative and even liberal backlash to the Black Lives Matter movement set in, notably its calls to defund the police. J.D. Vance, now the GOP vice presidential nominee, attacked liberal foundations as \"social justice hedge funds\" with a favorable tax status that should be revoked. And then the hammer fell when the Supreme Court ruled in June 2023 to ban affirmative action in colleges and universities. The ruling had nothing to do with philanthropy, and in California, such a ban has been in place since 1996. The state's ban is limited to public universities, but the Supreme Court ruling applies to both public and private institutions. The expansion was viewed as a warning shot, a preview of what a racially hostile judicial branch might take aim at next. Conservative groups have been filing lawsuits against programs that have racial equity as a goal, claiming they're discriminatory (one such lawsuit was filed last year against the Black Student Achievement Plan, the Los Angeles Unified School District's educational equity effort). One closely watched case in Georgia centers on the Fearless Fund, which was offering grants of up to $20,000 to Black women entrepreneurs via a competition. Fearless was sued by a conservative group last August that alleged it was practicing discrimination. In May, a federal appeals court upheld an injunction suspending Fearless' grant program. To combat California funders' rising anxiety about legal attacks and to educate them about what is actually illegal (supporting racial justice is not) and what is merely scare tactics, the California Black Freedom Fund in May launched the Legal, Education, Advocacy and Defense (LEAD) for Racial Justice Initiative, a partnership with lawyers who do just that. Philpart said he is already getting interest from organizations outside the state in utilizing LEAD's services -- another way in which California may be setting the pace for political resistance in the age of Trump. We need to. Eric Gorovitz, a tax attorney who advises nonprofits and works with LEAD, points out that groups like Students for Fair Admissions that have been around for years -- the affirmative action case started in 2014 -- are reaping the benefit of being the right thing, at the right time. \"The courts have caught up with them,\" he said. Patterson said that's all the more reason for the racial justice movement to hold firm and increase its own demands. \"Martin Luther King said we have an obligation to follow moral law,\" she said. \"Founders need to follow that morality. Time to call them to the carpet.\"\n"

      "In his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris , Donald Trump debuted the turducken of dog whistles: the claim that Harris would funnel taxpayer money to surgeries for transgender immigrants in prison. Since then, Republicans have put $60 million over two weeks into airing anti- trans ads heaped atop their public speaking and social media posting efforts to center this issue. There's an effective rejoinder Democrats could be deploying: Call out the bullshit, explain the motivation behind it, and sandwich this between an affirmation of what nearly all of us value and must vote to protect -- freedoms. The Democratic response? Largely silence. Or worse , tacitly reaffirming the opposition's position. Right now, the Harris campaign and aligned Democratic groups are leaving the issue unmentioned in ads, choosing to broadcast their economic bonafides plus draw the contrast with Republicans on abortion. This response is inadequate -- not just morally, but electorally. Ignoring racist dog whistles and transphobic siren songs only makes them more potent. Xenophobia has been a staple of Trump and Republicans' campaign pitches since he first rode down the golden escalator in 2016 to launch his race. From promises of a Mexico-funded border wall, to lies about immigrants eating cats and dogs , to threats of mass removal of long-time residents, Republicans rely on fear of some \"other.\" Time and tepid response, if any, from Democrats has only enabled these attacks to grow more virulent and voter sentiment about immigrants to grow more toxic. All the while, Republicans are doing their all to promote the notion of immigrants as a threat , especially in battleground states . Despite efforts among Democrats to tack right, to the dismay of many infrequent base voters they must turn out, voters on the whole still credit Republicans with superior handling of the issue. In the last few years, Republicans have expanded the scope of their scapegoating to transgender people -- with a focus on trans kids, in particular. Like the authoritarian leaders they admire, from Hungary's Viktor Orban to Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, Republicans know they must offer up new villains to keep their same tale fresh. Abroad, this means taking on \"gender ideology.\" Bolsonaro, for example, claimed his political opponents were handing out \"gay kits\" in schools and producing penis-shaped nipples for baby bottles . At home, from school board candidates running against \"indoctrination\" to governors signing increasingly draconian book, sports, and medical bans , transphobic fear-mongering dominates Republican campaigns. They are desperate to make the gender war happen, shoe-horning it into social media posts and attacking Harris' running-mate, Tim Walz, as \" Tampon Tim .\" The aforementioned $60 million on anti-trans ads comes from both Senate and presidential race spending. From repeating Trump's debate claim, to lying that schools are forcibly reassigning gender, to promising to protect girls' sports, ads on this theme feature shadowy jump cuts, ominous music, and accusations that Harris and Democrats are \"for they/them\" whereas \"Trump is for you.\" To be sure, Democrats must attend to issues that voters prioritize -- like making ends meet. But believing economic policies, sprinkled with some reproductive freedom on top, can best Republicans politics of resentment is demonstrably false. When Republican efforts at fear-mongering go uncontested, they don't go away. Nor are they addressed by attempting to change the subject. They require exposing the authoritarian strategy of and threat posed by MAGA Republicans coming to take away our freedoms. In January, we tested what happens when a sample of voters see a Republican anti-trans ad compared to those seeing that same ad with a Democratic response. When that Democratic rejoinder was a purely economic message, without any mention of trans people nor any rebuttal to the Republican claims, voters increased their support for Republican views. In contrast, when they viewed that opposition ad and then one employing the Race Class Gender Narrative, we neutralized the attack. What is the Race Class Gender Narrative ? A carefully researched clapback that creates a bigger \"we\" rooted in shared values, explains the motivations behind MAGA Republican claims, and calls for solidarity across differences to deliver the economic outcomes families need. Such a message refuses to choose between making a case for equality or fighting for economic well-being, making clear how both are intimately linked. All of this said, in this test, we were only able to hold steady on vote choice and that, of course, is insufficient. We recently went back into the field to address how we both blunt these Republican attacks and, critically, move voters toward Democrats. This time around, we looked at reactions to a Trump opposition ad making the aforementioned claim about transition surgeries in prisons. The efficacy of this opposition ad at moving voters toward Trump varies from around one point in our test to 2.7 in others' experiments. Fortunately, an ad we crafted with Way to Win and Gutsy Media viewed on its own moved registered voters 2.3 percent. This movement toward Harris appears especially pronounced among our most disaffected voters who initially said they would sit out the election or vote third-party. In a combat condition, where respondents viewed the opposition ad and then ours back-to-back, our testing netted out movement of 1.6 percent toward Harris. It also appears to boost trust in Democrats to \"handle lesbian, gay, and trans issues\" by just over 2 points. This effective ad kicks off by creating a big \"we,\" declaring: \"Black, white, or brown, Native or newcomer, transgender or not, Americans will not let anyone dim our light.\" It then calls out the opposition for their assaults on our freedom, \"MAGA Republicans ban books and health care,\" and our economic well-being, \"they \"rig the rules for corporations,\" explaining their MO: they \"try to distract us by singling people out to bully based on our races or genders.\" Finally, it employs a known persuasive social proof approach, telling viewers that their response to this is: \"We call BS. We show up for each other and we vote for leaders like Kamala Harris.\" With this wording, we're telling folks that people like them already believe and do the right thing here. To his credit, Walz has consistently employed this approach to rebuff a whole host of Republican attacks: Call out the other side, explain the motivation behind their lies, and draw a contrast between what they're peddling and what voters actually desire. Most recently, he said : \"We see it now, the hate has shifted toward the trans community. If you're watching any sporting events right now, you see that Donald Trump's closing arguments are to demonize a group of people for being who they are. We're out there trying to make the case that access to health care, a clean environment, manufacturing jobs and keeping your local hospital open are what people are really concerned about. They're running millions of dollars of ads demonizing folks who are just trying to live their lives.\" Right-wing populists, both foreign and domestic, have been operating from the same playbook for generations: Select someone to rebuke and revile, cast yourself in the role of savior of the nation from the looming danger, and lambast your opponents as abetting the destruction. Every time this happens, whether the villains are \"illegals,\" \"inner city crime,\" or trans kids, Democrats commit the cardinal sin of letting attacks go unanswered or, worse yet, tacitly affirming them by presenting a lower-calorie version of being against the \"other.\" For Democrats to win, we must make clear to voters that this election is about unifying the biggest possible \"we\": Americans across races and places, backgrounds and genders, accents and, yes, parties, rejecting MAGA Republicans' efforts to divide in order to control us. We win by running on and not from our values. Anat Shenker-Osorio is a political strategist and communications researcher for progressive campaigns.

      "By now, every pundit in America has their own 2024 election take, mostly confirming their prior opinions. Every Republican has a take, too, which is that Americans voted resoundingly for -- well, for whatever policy that Republican cares about, from opposition to transgender rights to support for prayer in schools. And of course, progressives, especially younger ones, have every right to feel afraid, angry, or alienated. But the data tells a specific story, not a choose-your-own-adventure. And that is that swing voters voted mostly out of economic insecurity and discontent . They actually liked Kamala Harris more than Donald Trump (Harris' favorability was 48 percent, compared to 44 percent for Trump). But Harris was the incumbent, and incumbents don't win elections when people think the economy is bad. This is not just an American phenomenon. As the Financial Times reported, in every developed country in the world , the incumbents lost this year. This is unprecedented. If, like me, you're being kept awake at night thinking about this election, this explanation helps. Yes, people were willing to put up with Trump's criminality, coup attempts, and extreme xenophobia, and that is still terrible. Many were also on board with scapegoating immigrants for our economic woes, which is as factually preposterous as it is morally offensive. But they didn't vote for MAGA. They didn't vote against women, or wokeness, or coastal elites, or climate regulation, or government regulation in general, or queer people. Not directly, anyway. They voted against the incumbent party, like every other developed country in the world this year. The shock waves from the Covid-19 pandemic -- inflation, empty shelves, housing prices -- are global, and this is a global trend. Everywhere in the world, voters have chosen to throw the bastards out because of the economy. In fact, if you look closely at the Financial Times data, Trump actually did worse than most other non-incumbents. Yes, he won a clear victory. But it was not as big a victory as parties in France, Italy, or even New Zealand. I don't think any Democrat could've won this election. Maybe, if there were a Bernie Sanders-like outsider figure, different enough from Joe Biden and Harris to not seem like a continuation of them, and possessed of Trump-like abilities to tune into the grievances and alienation of working-class people, that person could have won. (Biden himself, before his cognitive decline, had those qualities; he was known as Scranton Joe, after all.) But even then, that candidate would have to buck a global trend. I doubt anyone could do that. Of course, there's still much to be deeply concerned about, because why a country votes for a candidate, and what they actually get from them, are often completely different. And American voters voted for a candidate promising mass deportations, authoritarianism, reactionary anti-feminism, ethno-nationalism, and a mean, vindictive spirit of revenge, grievance, and retribution. Shit is about to get very real, very soon. And, quick history lesson, the Nazi party was voted into power in 1932 largely because of economic discontent . Once in power, parties do what they want to do, not what voters actually voted for. That's true even in economic policy specifically. Trump and his allies are likely to enact another wave of tax cuts for the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans -- the exact opposite of \"populism\" or help for the working class. So I don't want to sugarcoat anything. I also don't want to suggest that swing voters took a clear look at the two sides and made some rational, informed decision. They did not. Right-wing media like Fox News, right-wing influencers like Elon Musk , and supposedly \"independent\" figures like Joe Rogan all ignored or minimized Trump's past misdeeds, lied about immigrant crime, exaggerated the evils of \"wokeness,\" glossed over abject racism, and totally failed to connect the dots on the economy. It's not like swing voters took a long, hard look at Trump's felonies and mental health and voted for him anyway because of the price of eggs (more on that in a moment). They were, in part, bamboozled. But, while I think pessimism is the only morally justifiable outlook on the next few years, the reality of the 2024 election -- that swing voters voted for one thing, but Trump will deliver something else -- does mean those swing voters are soon to be let down, even enraged. Ultimately, there is likely to be a backlash. First, Americans have fucked around with fascism and are now going to find out what it really looks like. And while MAGA vulgarians like Fox's Jesse Watters think mass deportations will be \" hysterical ,\" in fact they will be traumatic. The first wave is likely to be people already in the justice system; that will enjoy wide popular support. But sooner or later, families will be torn apart. Longtime members of local communities will be arrested and disappeared. And inevitably, there will be scenes of cruelty. Remember, the violent arrest of a single Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez , arguably swung the 2000 presidential election. Multiply that by a thousand, and you can foresee a backlash not only of liberals but moderates and even conservatives as well. Second, America will also find out that Trump's economic policies are a bunch of snake oil. Tariffs will increase inflation, not decrease it. Opposing a livable minimum wage and breaking unions will hurt workers, not help them. And nothing will bring back the manufacturing jobs of the 1980s because big business depends on those lower wages in Mexico. \"Trump will fix it\" was one of the candidate's most appealing slogans. But he won't. On the contrary, he will make things worse. One example: the price of eggs again. Why are eggs so expensive right now? Not because of Biden's failed economic policies -- but because of the bird flu and corporate profiteering . Yet RFK Jr. wants to shred the agencies that help prevent outbreaks of diseases like this, and Project 2025 wants to deregulate the poultry industry. This will make the next outbreak more deadly and more expensive. I'm not suggesting that average voters will follow the news this closely, but they will notice the effects. In the most optimistic reading, swing voters may finally stop falling for the Republican shell game of populist/nationalist/religious rhetoric and plutocratic policies. This was the greatest innovation of Ronald Reagan: Appear populist (cowboy hat, family values) but act plutocrat (massive tax cuts for the rich, shredded social safety net for everyone else). George W. Bush did it too, and now Donald Trump . (Bernie Sanders talked about this in a video from 2003 that is currently going viral.) It's populist rhetoric, but plutocratic, anti-worker hyper-capitalism. So what happens when the emperor is revealed to have no clothes -- or even worse, the garb of the same financial \"elites\" he claims to be against? Obviously, the MAGA faithful will stay with Trump no matter what -- after all, his failure to bring about revolution in 2017 spawned the QAnon conspiracy theory, which said he was really about to do it, any day now. But the economic voters that gave him his victory could abandon Trump if he can't deliver results. And he cannot. While Trump is busy trying to throw his enemies in jail, he has no plan -- not even \"concepts of a plan\" -- for the kitchen-table concerns that actually put him into office. Maybe, just maybe, voters will see they've been conned. That is the best we can hope for.\n",

      "The devastation of Hurricanes Helene and Milton is almost indescribable. Businesses and infrastructure have been destroyed, people are in hospitals, and many have been forced out of their homes. At a time when the nation should be united -- to prepare, respond, and recover from these storms -- communities are being flooded with misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies promulgated for political purposes. Some elected voices have even promoted bizarre conspiracy theories implying that the storms have been created by the government, and the Republican ticket for president has lied about the availability of disaster relief . Shame on them all. But when the floods recede and the rebuilding begins in earnest, we must also wrestle with the reality that stronger, more frequent hurricanes are the byproducts of climate change , and we need leadership that faces this truth instead of lying about it. The climate crisis is not, as Donald Trump would have you believe, a \"hoax.\" The science is unequivocal, and coastal communities everywhere need us to solve the crisis or each and every year to come will only be more dangerous for our fellow Americans. The interaction between warming air and warming seawater creates stronger storms, as well as the rapid intensification that we have seen with Hurricanes Helene and Milton. These storms grew rapidly over the Gulf of Mexico, where the sea surface has reached unprecedented temperatures -- between 85 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. In the last 18 months alone, the upper layer of our ocean has broken numerous temperature records. We know the cause: the burning of fossil fuels, which drives up greenhouse gas levels and leads to 90 percent of that excess heat being absorbed by the oceans. This ocean warming spells disaster for life in the ocean and on land. Until we reduce our emissions, and even for a time thereafter because oceans will remain warm , our battered Gulf Coast and all those across the Southeast will face escalating danger. But guess what? Because climate change is human-made, so are its solutions. We can reduce emissions and create good jobs and clean energy at the same time. There's a big difference in this election: Trump wrongly thinks wind turbines cause cancer, while Vice President Kamala Harris knows they do create jobs. There's a reason nearly 100 U.S. ocean conservation leaders from all walks of life and across the political spectrum have come together to support Harris and Governor Tim Walz in this year's presidential election. They know that a healthy ocean is critical not just for our environment but for our economy, our culture, and our future, and that only one candidate understands the risk to coastal communities if we don't act now. Harris has been on the ground in Georgia and in North Carolina , consoling those who've lost everything and committing resources to help them rebuild. She knows it's not enough to respond to disasters after they've happened. We need to prevent them. Prevention is the foundation of resilience. That's why the Biden-Harris administration has invested nearly $7 billion in FEMA to help communities proactively reduce their vulnerability to climate-fueled events. The vice president's support for clean energy, including offshore wind, is helping to create jobs and make us a global leader in renewable energy innovation. Coastal communities are hurting. They have our prayers, but they also need national leadership in the next White House. If we want a healthy ocean, resilient coastal communities, and a livable planet, we need a politics based on truth -- and the truth is, there's only one choice in this election: Kamala Harris.\n"

      "Thanks to the conservative Supreme Court, thousands of Veterans Affairs Department rules and regulations are now vulnerable to court challenges, a scenario that could be ignited by a new Trump administration. As a young political staffer, one of the first hard lessons I learned was that in politics, there are no coincidences. During Donald Trump 's term as president, his administration's push to expand private health care for veterans through the VA Mission Act sparked significant controversy. Although Trump framed the law as fulfilling his campaign promise to offer veterans more \"choice\" in their health care, many major veterans service organizations saw it as a step toward privatizing the VA. They feared that the expansion of private care, which was estimated to cost billions, would drain resources from the VA's facilities and degrade the quality of care veterans relied on. This clash between Republicans and the veteran services organizations, centered around ensuring the law was implemented in line with congressional intent, aiming to protect the integrity of the VA system from being overshadowed by the private sector. Seven years after the VA Mission Act was passed, reviews have been mixed from veterans, and the VA Office of Inspector General has been critical. Between October 2023 and April 2024, the number of new patients waiting more than 20 days for primary care dropped by 19 percent, reflecting the VA's efforts to improve access to timely health care services. Additionally, the number of new patients waiting longer than 20 days for mental health care saw a 9 percent decrease. While these are improvements, they fall far short of what the MISSION Act promised. Many veterans have voiced their frustrations with the MISSION Act, citing a lack of quality providers in their communities and the VA's strict rules -- such as canceling more than one appointment leading to outright denial of claims. Some providers can be miles from where veterans live, or even in other states. In April, the VA's inspector general found significant shortcomings in the Veterans Health Administration's process for identifying health care providers who were removed due to policy violations related to safe and appropriate care. This failure led to both the inclusion of ineligible providers and the exclusion of eligible ones from the VA Community Care Program, prompting the inspector general to recommend a review of the criteria and processes used for such exclusions. Now, with a Trump-dominated Supreme Court overturning its past \" Chevron deference,\" the VA faces a second major blow to its status as the only public health care system in America. This decision fundamentally alters the way federal agencies operate. The Chevron doctrine, established in 1984, allowed agencies to interpret ambiguous laws within their jurisdiction without constant judicial interference. Its removal is far more than a legal technicality -- it carries immediate and severe consequences, especially for the millions of veterans who rely on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for their benefits and health care. The VA, like many other federal agencies, was empowered by Chevron to interpret complex and often ambiguous laws passed by Congress and translate them into actionable policies and health care doctrines. Chevron allowed the agency to adapt to new challenges and ensure veterans received the support they needed. Without Chevron , every interpretation the VA makes is now open to judicial review, paving the way for an avalanche of legal challenges that could overwhelm the system and delay or deny services to veterans. This legal uncertainty threatens the VA's ability to fulfill its mission to provide specialized health care to veterans. This shift in the legal landscape also plays directly into the hands of private health care interests, which have long sought to privatize the VA and its $325 billion budget, and $222 million in mandatory spending for fiscal year 2025. The VA is specifically designed to serve those who have served our country, and address their unique needs -- from combat-related injuries to mental health issues. A VA health care system that is prevented from making its own rules and regulations is useless to veterans and undermines the America's promise to care for those who \"have borne the battle.\" With backing from a second Trump administration, private health care companies will no doubt see an opportunity. They no longer need to battle organizations like the American Legion or VFW for control of the VA -- they just need to convince the courts that the VA doesn't have the legal authority to care for veterans. With thousands of rules and regulations interpreted by the VA on behalf of Congress open to challenge, the VA could be stopped in its tracks. The legal chaos following this would end the VA as we know it. The third and final blow to the VA would come if, as the Chevron ruling suggests, the department loses its legal authority to make new rules altogether. Given the varying timelines for passing veterans' legislation -- ranging from 50 years for something as comprehensive as the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to toxic chemicals, to months for cost-of-living adjustments -- Congress simply wouldn't be able to draft bills and regulations quickly enough to keep pace with the VA's daily demands. The future of the Department of Veterans Affairs hangs in the balance. A second Trump term, coupled with the dismantling of Chevron deference, could cripple the VA's ability to serve those who have sacrificed for our nation. The agency's capacity to interpret and implement laws is essential for meeting the unique and complex needs of veterans. Without this authority, the VA could become entangled in endless legal battles, leaving veterans caught in the crossfire of privatization efforts and regulatory paralysis. This is not just a legal issue -- it is a profound moral and ethical challenge. The VA stands as the nation's promise to its veterans, and that promise must be upheld. The question we face is whether that promise will endure, or whether it will be sacrificed in the name of deregulation and privatization, leaving millions of veterans without the care and support they have earned.

      "Ruwa Romman is a Georgia state representative. She is the first Muslim woman elected to the Georgia state House and first Palestinian elected to any public office in the state's history. I landed back home two days after I was initially supposed to, after a whirlwind week at the Democratic National Convention , where not a single Palestinian was allowed a speaking role onstage. While many have now seen me read my leaked speech , the tears that escaped my eyes were not about being rejected. Frankly, my expectations of the DNC have always been nonexistent. When the Uncommitted Movement team let me know I was one of the names they had submitted, I knew that we would be more likely exposing the structural racism in the party than actually getting anyone on that stage. To me, it simply served as an important reminder of all the work left to do to dismantle the hierarchy in the party that places the lives of Palestinians below everyone else. So no, I didn't cry because the DNC showed the nation the structural racism against Palestinians. I cried because I deeply missed my grandfather. My grandfather passed away in 2021, a few weeks before an article was published that suggested I was considering running for office (I wasn't). I had just seen him the week prior and could not understand how he was gone. I found myself drowning in shock and grief. When my Arab, Muslim, and organizing communities began pushing me to run, I vividly remember telling a family friend that as a Palestinian, I had no idea if I could bear advocating on any issues related to Palestinians with this gaping wound inside of me. He assured me that this role would be focused on the state level and convinced me that there is so much good work that can be done. After all, these were issues I've advocated for nearly a decade on like expanding Medicaid, fully funding education, and protecting our right to vote. He insisted that I couldn't let this opportunity go. With the promise of working to help communities I advocate for, growing pressure, and a devastating grief in my heart, I surprised even myself and launched our campaign. When we won, the media attention was beyond overwhelming. In hindsight, I should have prepared for it, but I didn't fully grasp the historic nature of my candidacy. To me, I was running to put public service back into politics and help Georgians any way that I could. I just happened to be Muslim and Palestinian. When I got off that plane after the DNC, I once again found myself thinking about how I should have also prepared for the reality of this moment -- one that requires me to make an impossible decision. How am I supposed to find my way to supporting someone who will have the ability to stop the massacre of my people but refuses to publicly commit to doing so, and won't even offer us a symbolic gesture? While the choices this cycle may seem so stark, many in my Arab and Muslim community are asking how I can vote for someone who cannot commit to ending the genocide of my people? To a grieving community where so many of them barely survived the first nightmare Donald Trump presidency, but who are also now watching as their families and loved ones are eliminated using our tax dollars and bombs, the choice feels impossible. I have agonized over this question every single day. Having this conversation right now feels like talking about politics at a funeral. The urgency and complexity is even more intense since early voting started in Georgia, a key swing state. So today, I once again find myself propelled by a grief so overwhelming it has made breathing, let alone making decisions, impossible some days. Voting this year carries a heavier weight, as it feels like choosing between survival and surrender. Please know this is not fear-mongering. It is a reality. Organizing around Palestine is difficult already with unprecedented efforts to silence and punish advocates. I don't believe there's anything worse than genocide. But the reality is a second Trump presidency would ensure continued disaster for our community and far too many other allied communities as well. There is no handbook or instruction sheet we get for this moment. There is no established process that ensures the final decision will be the right one in the end. But there are allies, friends, family, supporters, and conscientious people that show up. Our beautiful multifaith, multiracial, multigenerational anti-war coalition saved my life the past year. The coalition that I am so grateful to be a part of kept me grounded. We stood together in solidarity, reminding the world that it was our collective impact that would bring about progress and desperately needed change, not any one of us individually. It is that coalition that I always think of when voting, and this moment cannot be an exception. While I will be voting for Vice President Harris, it must be said that this vote isn't for her. It's for the people in my district and state who cannot survive another Trump presidency. And yes, it's for my community and our allies who refuse to sit by while our resources are used to commit a genocide in our names. Unlike President Joe Biden , Vice President Harris has a mixed record on the issue. She voted no on more weapons to Israel in 2019 and she consistently advocated to get aid into Gaza . I personally shared with her during a rally in Atlanta in July that our community is willing to give her a chance, but we need the bombs to stop and need her to enforce our laws. She agreed that the violence must end so that aid can get in, and we can de-escalate a rapidly expanding regional war. Is that enough? Of course not. The urgency of this moment requires moral clarity and real leadership. And that is what we must continue demanding. My vote is a promise -- a promise that I and those who stand with me will not stop demanding the end of mass slaughter and violence everywhere. It's a promise that, if Vice President Harris wins, we will work both for the people in my district and to use every avenue to demand she end this genocide and the decades-long, bigoted policies that have led to mass destruction, death, and displacement of Palestinians. I tell people often, you don't need to trust your elected officials. Show up and hold us accountable -- remember we work for you. Vote for Vice President Harris not because she represents all of our ideals, but because there is a chance, even slim, that we can push her. But we can't stop there: We must demand more, continue organizing and make it impossible for Vice President Harris -- or anyone -- to ignore our call demanding that she follow U.S. and international laws by ending the transfer of weapons being used to commit genocide. So to our incredible coalition, do not ever surrender. There will be a day after this election that demands we keep working. History is full of moments of the naysayers saying things will never change until we change them. This work continues regardless of the timeline of elections. Remember, Philip Randolph first proposed the March on Washington 20 years before it happened . History is riddled with examples of leaders maintaining their oppositional stances to our movements until they finally listened. If we cannot imagine a better future, we'll never be able to achieve it. It's time to not only renew our commitment to our anti-war movement but also merge the efforts of those in the streets with those in the halls of power. Let's plan for a mass demonstration in D.C. that ends with us meeting with our members of Congress to pressure them to shift our unjust policies and commit to not another bomb dropping on Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian loved ones. We can, and must, recommit our efforts to our anti-war movement in every lane from politics, to art, to mass mobilization. And to Vice President Harris, there is so much promise in your historic candidacy and, hopefully, presidency. There is no reason for you to make this genocide any part of it. You enforced the law in the largest state in our country. You can do the same on the international stage and stop sending the weapons being used to kill innocent people, that are dragging us into a regional war, and that are breaking our own laws. Americans do not want another forever war. Listen to us.\n"

      "Steve Bannon is a troll. Never forget that. Because trolling is exactly what he was doing last weekend when he suggested Donald Trump could run for president in 2028 to serve, if he won, a third term in office. Trump can't do this, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Now, if you're someone who believes that there are no rules, or at least that there are no rules that apply to Donald Trump, and that any norm-breaking democracy-threatening thing he, his advisers, or even his opponents can imagine is possible -- well, then nothing I say here will convince you. Just go ahead and give up now. But for everyone else, the Constitution is eminently clear. The 22nd Amendment says: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" It was added to the Constitution after Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected for a fourth term, to prevent anyone else from serving as long as he did. No other president has served more than two terms. And neither will Donald Trump. Some folks may be wondering whether the 22nd Amendment applies to nonconsecutive terms, like Trump's two terms in office. It does. When the amendment was written, it could have said: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice consecutively.\" But it doesn't. It puts a numerical limit on the number of times someone can be elected. That total of two can be reached by two consecutive terms or two nonconsecutive terms. The language covers both options. I am confident Bannon knows this and made his comments this weekend knowing they would rally his crowd (which cheered enthusiastically) and that his comments would get liberals all worked up about the prospect (and many have been). But even the person Bannon credited with the idea -- conservative movement lawyer Mike Davis -- told a reporter who asked whether he told Bannon that Trump can serve a third term, \"Of course not! That's crazy.\" To be clear, we could walk down some technical rabbit holes to get to a possible third term for Trump. The 22nd Amendment mentions only that someone cannot be elected more than twice to the office of the presidency. What if Trump is J.D. Vance's vice president on the 2028 ticket and then Vance resigns? Or if Trump is elected speaker of the House in 2029 (a position that doesn't need to be filled by an actual member of the House) and becomes second in line for the presidency and then both the president and vice president resign? Scenarios like these have received the attention of scholars of the 22nd Amendment. Does the Constitution's use of the word \"elect\" mean these other routes are possible, or do we hew to the clear spirit of the provision by prohibiting someone from serving more than two terms, no matter the path taken? Or, possibly, Trump could just decide to run a third time and dare someone to stop him. Ultimately, the Supreme Court, with three justices currently appointed by Trump and possibly more by 2028, would decide the matter -- the same court that, earlier this year allowed him to remain on the ballot even though people had accused him of being an insurrectionist and thus ineligible to run for president under the 14th Amendment. If this comes to pass, nothing matters, and there will likely be plenty of similarly dire things for us to be worrying about as Trump gears up for his fourth run at the White House -- whether it be concentration camps, another Great Depression, a mass polio outbreak, or other horrors we can't yet imagine. Until then, don't listen to trolls.\n",

      "The parenthetical space between Christmas and the new year is the closest thing many of us get to Jubilee, the ancient biblical holiday in which debts were forgiven and indentured servants were released from bondage. Instead of relief from the $1.2 trillion Americans hold in credit card debt or the $1.8 trillion of student debt helping Nelnet staff some of America's least helpful customer service teams, the 2024 version of Jubilee more or less means we're not expected to reply to emails or attend meetings. Not so at The Washington Post , where some of America's highfalutin-est bloggers used the end-of-year break to turn their sage gazes toward the preceding 51 weeks and contemplate soberly what 2025 means for the United States of America. The Washington Post editorial board was unanimous: the world sure is wacky, but Americans need to chill the hell out about it. Sure, things might seem bad -- astute followers of American politics might be aware that we're about to endure a second Trump term -- but in some ways, things have never been better! \"There's a fascinating interplay between alarmism and complacency, between catastrophizing about the future and idealizing the past,\" wrote the Post . \"A little fear is necessary to spur action; too much becomes paralyzing. [...] It's easy to lose sight of the reality that there has never been a better time to be alive. The poorest Americans have access to better medical care than the richest royals did a century ago.\" On one hand, this is a throwaway line in a self-indulgent op-ed I'm sure its own writers have already forgotten; a tear lost in the unceasing rain of content. On the other, this is grossly disrespectful of the very real indignities dumped upon normal Americans. Homelessness skyrocketed last year (even as a likely undercount ); food pantries are busier than ever since the expanded Child Tax Credit expired; 26 million people don't have health insurance ; and our doddering president, when he isn't rolling out the red carpet for a man he calls a \" genuine threat to democracy ,\" continues to send endless money to a satellite state that has killed more Gazans than there are residents in my hometown (to say nothing of the yet-unmeasured tolls of disease and starvation). Would the Post urge us to take comfort in the knowledge that a century ago a lot more people were dying of tuberculosis? Big fucking whoop! A third of Americans avoid health care altogether because they can't pay for it. It's hard to be overjoyed about advances in health care if you can't afford to touch those advances in the first place. This type of claim typically protrudes from the tactically annoying and professionally sycophantic: the past is a grotesque animal, and things are better on this end of the arc of time than the other, so disdain at the state of the world is hysterical and myopic. It is a brain-smoothing, self-soothing refrain which minimizes concern with the present by smiling contentedly at the great \" line go up \" of world history -- and which, by no coincidence, validates the work of the rich and powerful people who got us here. The Post 's reminder that \"there has never been a better time to be alive\" is a request for calm from a group of people who have never found themselves or those they love on the grindstone. \"Three cheers for progress\" is something you can say when that progress has benefited you most of all. It should be obvious that I reject this claim. It is, of course, true in a very literal sense. I would prefer to be born in 1988 than 1888. There is no question that the world contains more material wealth now than it did a century ago, and that advancements in production mean America today would be unrecognizable to someone born during the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century. (Perhaps not entirely so: they might feel right at home in a country where 1 percent of Americans own a third of the nation's wealth , a distribution even more skewed than the robber barons' slice of the pie.) But the machine of capitalism does not distribute progress evenly, and if we wish to maintain our integrity we should assess its performance as a function of its capacity. We must envision the world as it could be and measure the distance to the real. An uncritical celebration of history is a lazy one. The Post is right about health care in one sense. In general, people don't die as soon as they used to. Take infant mortality, for example: how many children die within a year of birth. These rates have plummeted -- from around 70 per 1,000 births in 1925 to 5.6 in 2022 . This improvement was largely led by the development of public health infrastructure rather than advancements in medical technology like the Post might imply, but it's obviously outstanding (if still 20 percent higher than peer countries ). But these gains are not shared equally. In 2022, 10.9 out of 1,000 Black children died before their first birthday. That's more than twice the rate of white children -- 4.5 per 1,000. Like nearly everything in American health care, health outcome disparity is distributed along the lines of race. Or, more accurately, racism . There is no inherent propensity toward dying during infancy which explains the discrepancy between Black and white infant mortality; there is no natural law compelling Black babies to die at twice the rate of white babies. We are offered a benchmark: if it is possible for white infant mortality to hit 4.5 per 1,000, it must also be possible for Black infant mortality to hit 4.5 per 1,000 in parallel. It has not. This gap has exploded over the past century. Black infant mortality was 1.5 times white infant mortality in the early 1920s, and now it's 2.4 times as high -- a 60 percent increase. Black infants die at a relative rate higher than what we saw before the Civil Rights Act, even when the education levels and income of their mothers are controlled. Within this great wave of progress is countervailing destructive force to which only some Americans are victims. Should they be reassured by a reminder that things were worse in the past? Singh GK, Yu SM. \"Infant Mortality in the United States, 1915-2017: Large Social Inequalities have Persisted for Over a Century.\" International Journal of MCH and AIDS 2019. On the other end of the stick, we have life expectancy. Let's give it up for the status quo: life expectancy has increased from 58 a hundred years ago to around 78 today. Which, generally, is good news! But here too the gains are concentrated among the powerful, who only sometimes drag the rest of us up with them. Before Covid, rich men lived 15 years longer than poor men and rich women lived 10 years longer than poor women. (A study of life expectancy in California during 2020-2021 saw the gap widen by two additional years .) As in infant mortality, that gap has increased. The Brookings Institution found that among people born in the 1970s the life expectancy difference between rich and poor women was about 3.5 years -- which means the gap has almost tripled in the 50 years since. This was not a rising tide lifting all boats; this change was driven primarily by an extension of rich lives, while the lengths of poor lives stayed flat. The causes of early death among low-income people -- heart disease, gun violence, overdoses, coronavirus -- are associated with the economic deprivation of poor and rural areas when extractive industries dominate regional economies , consolidating wealth and natural resources among a small number of wealthy corporations and their shareholders, who use their political and economic power to preserve their predatory status until they either leave or are outmaneuvered by even more powerful movements of industry. The gains of the wealthy come from the labor of the poor. This life expectancy difference represents an aggregate theft of millions of years of life . Does this not warrant cynicism? Is it so short-sighted to disdain the uncritical celebration of modernity? The well-founded perception of being fucked over reasonably asterisks the celebration of progress. Am I meant to celebrate that millions of Americans may exist near medical treatments that will ruin their lives? Ought I take the Post 's advice and say \"Wahoo!\" for advances in health care when 20 percent of Americans have medical debt they believe they'll never pay off -- debt which prevents them from seeking further care they need? I might interrogate the value in turning to a man dying bankrupt from heart disease and saying, \"Cheer up! It could have been tuberculosis!\" The Washington Post ends its paean to letting the good times roll with a resolution. \"Rather than assume the worst,\" it says, \"let's resolve to do everything we can to help engineer the best possible outcome for the world.\" I maintain that this feat of engineering requires understanding thoroughly the blueprint by which the current world was constructed. Even sweatshop sweetheart Nicholas Kristof understands that suffering on this level is a policy choice -- a political construct which must be met with political power. It is something between cynical and self-indulgent to look out at the world, wave one's hands, and declare, \"Sure hope this gets better soon!\" and yet this is precisely what the authors of \"progress\" fanfiction urge us to do. It is possible to hold two thoughts at once. One, a century of technological, medical, and social developments have been tremendously good for millions and millions of people and should be celebrated; and two, that these benefits have not fallen upon all God's children alike, and that this gap constitutes a hideous moral failure: that there was the potential to do more, and that we in this great and celebrated wave of progress refused to do it. Sitting on our hands and fantasizing about inevitable progress will do nothing to relieve those who suffer now, in the real world. This failure will continue unabated, the gap ever stretching, until we muster the political force required to abolish it.\n"

      "Anat Shenker-Osorio is a political strategist and communications researcher for progressive campaigns. Since Donald Trump and Republicans seized control of the federal government, we've seen a flood of illegal executive orders plus a takeover of the Treasury Department and other government agencies by a billionaire who paid his way into shadow presidency. Democrats, in response, have issued sternly worded social media posts , threats to deny a budget deal five weeks away, and promises of future legislation to render illegal the current crime of breaking and entering. To be sure, #NotAllDemocrats applies. Lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, and Jamie Raskin have made potent denunciations and cast votes to indicate they would like to stop the authoritarian takeover of our government. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Don Beyer led a delegation to the U.S. Agency for International Development and filed an injunction to block Elon Musk 's efforts to destroy the agency . But they are the exception. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose publicized strategy is wait till Trump screws up, has helped him get his robber-baron Cabinet picks seated while tut-tutting about tariffs . Sen. Amy Klobuchar told The New York Times , \"Well, first of all, it is very clear that, if there is a middle of all of this hot mess of division, Americans want us to work together when we can and find common ground. We have said repeatedly -- our leaders, individual senators -- that we are ready to do that. So that's number one.\" According to NBC News, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told his colleagues to \"tune out the noise\" of most of Trump's actions and \"zero in on pocketbook issues.\" How that manifests when Musk is presently looting the Treasury Department, while most Democrats make empty speeches or look on, remains to be seen. Why have most Democrats refused to pull out all the stops to block Trump's cabinet of kleptocrats and halt the administrative coup afoot? In part because polling has become the party's stand in for position-taking. Too many Democratic leaders determine what to say based on what polls purport to tell them voters think. Never mind those polls -- in bringing issues top of mind in order to ask about them -- couldn't possibly detect what's most salient, nor do they tell us how people make arguably the most critical electoral decision: whether or not to vote in the first place. If you follow the news even tangentially, you'll have some sense that the majority of Americans oppose many of Trump's executive orders and actions. You will also know that Americans' number one issue ever and always is what's in their wallets. And, obviously, who can blame people for worrying about having food on their tables and a roof over their heads? You know this because a big chunk of America's news coverage consists of reporting on what people think of the news, rather than providing context and insight into what is actually happening. But the fact that large percentages of Americans approve or disapprove of something means absolutely nothing in terms of what comes next. Democrats may follow polls to figure out what to talk about, but virtually no politicians use them to govern. Political scientists have long measured what the public supports and what public policy gets enacted and found there's very little correlation between them. Witness, for example, majoritarian support for abortion care , which did not save it nor the Democrats purportedly campaigning for it. Consider how 85 percent of Americans favor banning the assault weapons currently for sale across the U.S. If public opinion dictated public policy, you would have affordable health care . A Princeton University study examining aggregate polling-reported preferences across over 1,700 policy issues concluded, \"When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.\" In other words, the billionaires who finance our representatives call the shots -- more now than ever. Still, every couple of years, \"we the average Americans\" go through the fantasy that we get a say in the decisions that impact our lives by voting for representatives. Your vote, to use the common slogan, is your voice. It's just that \"cha-ching\" is drowning it out. The ubiquity of public opinion polling and reporting on it lends dangerous credence to the fiction that what the majority of Americans purport to want -- as filtered through the inescapable biases of question wordings, sampling approaches, and weighting methods -- has some meaningful impact on what happens in politics. And it doesn't. This is directly responsible for our current inability to confront MAGA's efforts to prey upon our country and feast upon the carcass. Upholding the veneer that we live in a representative democracy lends legitimacy to the Trump regime, even as he came to power after attempting to overthrow the government, thanks to the judges and justices he put on the bench excusing and abetting his criminal conspiracy . Attempts to check MAGA's ongoing crime spree are too often met with a shrug and a well, the voters decided refrain. This emerges over and again as the reason Democrats in leadership and elite media claim to be incapable of confronting the litany of illegal moves MAGA makes or even clearly naming them as such. Instead of becoming daunted or defeated by what polling claims about \"where Americans are,\" there's a counterintuitive liberation to realizing that public opinion has not delivered policy change. Yes, a majority of people agreeing with your view means nothing. But a majority of people opposing your view is similarly meaningless -- if you can get a small sliver to not merely agree but sustain robust action. Civil rights -- the cause, the tactics , and the leaders -- were unpopular in their day. Until, that is, average Americans saw with their own eyes the courage and righteousness of people boycotting, sitting in, and protesting in the face of horrific repression. The notion of a Muslim ban in Trump's first run at office held a slim majority of support until people rushed off to airports to offer free legal help and voice their objections. Watching Americans demonstrate their disapproval led to shifting public attitudes, and eventually the majority came to oppose this campaign promise. And while the swift Republican-engineered backlash has memory-holed it, the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd immediately increased support for the cause by double digits. Tragically, that support fell once the protesting abated . This is a familiar pattern that scholars of authoritarianism have noted worldwide: Public action moves public opinion. But far more importantly, public action yields better public policy. Campaigns of peaceful civil resistance that involve a threshold of 3.5 percent of the population of a country consistently topple autocratic regimes. Sometimes, the first move you make is wildly unpopular. But doing it doesn't merely move you toward your goal, it alters the majority public opinion many Democrats are so feverishly chasing. Actions shift how people perceive what is occurring -- what is at stake, who are the villains, victims, and heroes -- and which issues are most salient to consider next time people vote. They can change the dynamic of a future election from one that is about, say, \"the border\" and \"law and order,\" to one that is about wresting our freedoms and our families, our lives and our livelihoods, from the grip of billionaires hell-bent on our destruction. We cannot poll, cajole Democrats, or even vote our way to democracy. We must take to the streets and demand it.\n",

      "Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins' tenure is off to a rocky start. The former Georgia congressman and unapologetic Donald Trump loyalist began by releasing a series of videos assuring that \"despite the rhetoric, there would be no cuts at VA. \" These videos preceded two rounds of layoffs at the department -- first, 1,000 employees, many of them veterans, and then another 1,400 last week . Notably, Collins was not being forced to make these cuts by Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Instead, he appears to be slashing VA jobs simply to win favor with Trump and Elon Musk . While Trump's government proudly touts its \"savings,\" the reality is that DOGE's cuts are built on lies, mismanagement, and outright cruelty. The New York Times recently exposed how the department grossly inflated five of its largest cost-cutting claims, citing billions in savings that were either fictional, exaggerated, or predated the organization's existence . Then it outright deleted these claims from its website. The number of veterans losing their jobs is damning. Among the 3,700 or so VA employees fired were specialists in PTSD treatment, oncology researchers, and crisis line staffers. One veteran, a suicide prevention counselor, was let go with nothing more than a generic email. Another, a disabled former Army sergeant working in claims processing, was terminated just before his probationary period ended, cutting off his ability to join a union and fight back. Congress estimates that 6,000 veterans have been fired by DOGE, but this number is low. Many former military officers and others do not qualify for veteran status under federal guidelines, even though they are in fact veterans. With DOGE targeting the Department of Defense -- the world's largest employer of veterans -- Congress estimates that up to 50,000 veterans could lose their jobs in the next six months. This would not only cripple the lives of 50,000 of America's best, but also create a severe economic ripple effect. To make matters worse, the VA cut $2 billion in government contracts , 70 percent of those belong to service disabled veteran-owned businesses. Many of these veterans rely on VA-backed home loans, which could see a spike in defaults, while unemployment claims would surge. The loss of their spending power in concentrated markets would further strain consumer and other economic sectors. In the end, DOGE will cost the American taxpayer far more than it could ever hope to save. Recently, Musk demanded that all federal employees -- including the 30 percent who are veterans -- justify their existence in five bullet points or face termination. He then reneged on this ultimatum, only to double down on it later. It's clear that Musk is not only hopelessly clueless about federal law but also completely incompetent when it comes to leading or managing people. Meanwhile, as he plays these games, our nation's heroes are left scrambling -- forced to consider selling their homes, relocating, returning to school, or selling their belongings just to make rent. This is one of the most disgraceful attacks on American citizens by their own government since the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II (and the U.S. might be headed in that direction soon) . Let's be clear: DOGE is not about saving money. It's about weakening public services to justify privatization. The VA, the largest integrated health care system in the country, has long been a target of conservatives who want to dismantle it piece by piece, handing its functions over to private industry. They see veterans not as people who deserve care, but as customers to be exploited for profit. These cuts are part of a larger, coordinated effort to make the VA seem dysfunctional -- so that handing it over to for-profit entities seems like the only solution. As for taking everything that veterans have worked for from right under their feet. The reason for that is far more simple: There is no reason. It's simply to throw red meat to the thugs on X and Truth Social who want to see the world burn, because their own lives are terrible. This isn't about efficiency -- it's about cruelty. Plain and simple. And the group feeling it the most are those who have selflessly given so much to this nation to have it literally thrown back in their face as a reward.\n"

      "When Elon Musk appeared in the Oval Office on Feb. 11 alongside President Donald Trump to discuss his latest slashing of federal funding, he was joined by his four-year-old son, X AE A-Xii, better known to the world as X. \"Great guy,\" Trump said of the toddler. \"He's a high IQ individual.\" X, for his part, had his own agenda. \"I need to go pee,\" X could be heard whispering to Trump as Musk spoke. Musk, an unelected government official, went on to call bureaucracy a \"fourth unelected branch of government\" as his son rubbed his eyes. Reactions to the press conference focused on how cute X is, with online commentators fawning over the toddler. It's not a coincidence that Musk, a 'special government employee' who is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), brought his son into the Oval Office. Musk is the father of 12 known children and is dedicated to the cause of pronatalism , a movement which espouses the belief that having many children is not only a social imperative, but a necessity for the continuation of society. According to Musk , declining birth rates are \"not just a crisis, but the crisis,\" and he's contributing to efforts to bring society back from the brink of collapse by having more children. Moreover, by accompanying his dad to work, X acted both as a shield for Musk as he faced reporters and an extension of Musk's brand. The appearance of X in the Oval Office can't be viewed in isolation. \"I see it as part of the very clear propaganda regime that is the Trump administration. They are very, very focused on optics and part of that is this 'pro-family agenda,'\" says Emily Armick, former counsel to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and author of the New York Times -bestselling Democracy in Retrograde . When Musk brings his child into a professional work environment, the child functions as a prop, \"to deflect from the obvious harm that he's trying to inflict on the U.S. government and the American people.\" Musk's appearance with his son comes amidst a barrage of news, including Musk cutting funding to federal agencies which have been investigating his companies and conflicts of interest that Senator Elizabeth Warren calls the size of \"Mount Everest.\" \"None of this was accidental,\" said Jo Piazza, author and host of Under the Influence , a podcast examining the role of influencers in society. \"Elon Musk is very clearly trying to make himself seem more human because right now, he's one of the most hated figures in America . It's exactly like a parenting influencer using their kid to enhance their brand and to get attention.\" When Musk stands in the Oval Office with the President and his young son, he's flaunting his brand as blatantly as any parent influencer, online creators who rely on their children and their status as parents to create content and gain views, fame, and sponsorships. In the world of the parent influencer, everything is content and each interaction with a child is an opportunity to further your brand. Even a work meeting can be turned into content -- like Musk and X in the Oval office. And it seems to have worked -- videos and photos of X in the Oval Office went viral and for a moment, the attention on Musk was focused on his child, not on his haphazard slashing of federal funding or his conflicts of interest. At one point, Musk lifted his son on his shoulders. At another, the four-year-old appeared to pick his nose and wipe it on the Resolute Desk. Later, X leaned his head against the desk, prompting comparisons to a famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his father despite the fact that X's dad, Musk, isn't the President, or even an elected official. Like any good parent influencer, Musk knows which child to center. Four-year-olds are gold for the algorithms that dictate an influencer's life. The algorithm reacts more favorably to content with babies and toddlers, with that content generally performing better than content featuring older children. \"I think that Elon Musk, in particular, knows very well how to cater to these algorithms,\" Piazza said. \"He chose the kid who was going to be the most camera-friendly for him in this situation.\" It's not only the Oval Office that X has graced -- he's appeared at the Super Bowl, Capitol Hill meetings, and Mar-a-Lago with Musk. Expect to see X in more meetings and press conferences with his father -- because like any parent looking to leverage their children's lives for content and a reputational boost, Musk isn't going to give up on something that works.\n",

      "Pre-election transition planning is famously so tight-lipped that you'd barely know it is happening when you read the news of the day. The dreaded headline claims the candidate is \" measuring the drapes of the White House \" long before any votes are counted. Opposing campaigns are all too eager to pounce on the arrogance of that presumption. This is why the recent trickle of news about the Trump transition planning is so intriguing -- particularly the revelation that Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is serving as a transition whisperer. Earlier this month when journalist Michael Tracey asked Trump transition co-chair (and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO) Howard Lutnick who was advising the transition on personnel issues, he wouldn't name anyone, except Kushner. Lutnick revealed that when it comes to staffing a second Trump government,: \"Jared Kushner is a big help to me ... he's absolutely helping me.\" This is big news, since Kushner has regularly denied any interest in returning to the Trump inner circle, indicating that he'd prefer to continue operating his private equity firm, Affinity Partners . Nevertheless, last winter Axios suggested there was still a slimmer of a chance he'd be back. Congressional Democrats are also paying attention , concerned Kushner's is already peddling influence. The question right now seems to be: Will Kushner's role in the Trump transition be anything more than just what Lutnick described? There are a couple of reasons to think so. For one, it was Kushner -- along with Mike Pence and Steve Bannon -- who was in charge of the transition in 2016, the last time Trump won. Shockingly at the time, he was the one who ordered the firing of Governor Chris Christie , whom Trump chose during the campaign to direct the transition ( Steven Bannon was the one who broke the news to Christie). Court documents later revealed that it was likely Kushner who directed Michael Flynn during the 2016 transition to contact members of the UN Security Council about an upcoming vote on Israeli settlements, a move that ended with Flynn out of a job as national security adviser after pleading guilty that he lied to the FBI. Four years later, Kushner allegedly helped obstruct the Biden-Harris transition after Trump lost the 2020 election. Former Trump Press Secretary Alyssa Farah Griffin told the House Jan. 6 committee in 2022 that Kushner did not want to share information about White House Covid efforts and vaccine development with the Biden-Harris transition team. According to Griffin, he told Dr. Deborah Birx, who was coordinating the White House's response to the pandemic, \"absolutely not\" when she asked about information sharing at a White House meeting after the election. Kushner may be trying to stay out of politics publicly, but he is one of the few remaining Trump loyalists with first-hand experience on a transition. Additionally, close Kushner allies are already central to Trump's 2024 transition team. In August, when former Small Business Administration Administrator Linda McMahon was named to co-chair the transition, she brought with her key figures at the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), the think tank overflowing with former Trump officials as a government-in-waiting. One of them was Brooke Rollins, the president and CEO of AFPI who worked under Kushner at the White House Office of American Innovation. He later maneuvered her into the top job at the Domestic Policy Council. Today, Rollins seems to be running much of the day-to-day operations of the Trump transition team, and she's even been rumored to be in contention to be the next White House chief of staff. The last reason a Kushner return makes sense is Trump's demand for total loyalty. Lutnick told the Financial Times recently that fealty \"to the man\" would be required. Who better than his son-in-law to enact this vision of total devotion to Trump for the next administration? For four years, Kushner weathered unprecedented staff turnover in the White House. Even after Jan. 6, it was Kushner still in his office working away. Trump's 2024 transition has been worrisome, outside of Kushner's alleged involvement. Already, the Trump transition team has stalled on signing a memorandum of understanding with the General Services Administration, the federal agency in charge of making sure the transition of power is seamless and secure. If this persists, Trump's transition team won't be permitted to receive the ample resources and assistance provided by the GSA. Based on what I learned for my book on the 2020 transition, refusing this help is an incredibly risky decision for the country. Worse still would be the near total lack of accountability on transition planning. Without an MOU, the transition team wouldn't be required to disclose the names of its donors nor cap the amount of donations, usually set at $5,000. In this environment, conflicts of interest would be rampant and self-dealing all-but encouraged. There are already reports that Lutnik, the current transition co-chair, may be mingling his work on the transition with lobbying for his firm's crypto interests. Even if these ethical issues are resolved in some fashion, Kushner has been central to two of the most chaotic transitions in U.S. history. The 2016 transition was a master-class of disregard for rules and inattention to detail. In 2020, on the way out, dragged its feet to render the incoming Biden-Harris administration much less prepared to govern than it should've been. A bumpy final stretch of this campaign is surely ahead. These signs point to an even bumpier transition period that may soon follow, and possibly a return to the fold for Trump's son-in-law.\n"

      "Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is co-founder of the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab , distinguished scholar at Bowdoin College, and author of New York Times bestseller What If We Get it Right?: Visions of Climate Futures . By the end of Donald Trump 's second presidential term, sea levels will be higher, weather will be more extreme, and the urgency for implementing climate solutions will be even greater. Yet on day one of his administration, Trump signed nine executive orders aiming to sabotage climate solutions -- from obstructing renewable energy development; to re-opening protected areas to drilling, mining, and logging; to terminating all federal environmental justice programs and positions; to declaring an \"energy emergency\" (despite U.S. oil and gas production currently setting an all-time global record ) that would allow fossil fuel projects to evade environmental protections; to bailing on the Paris Agreement (again); and even redefining \"energy resources\" to exclude solar and wind. (As previewed in Project 2025 .) And one can only guess what else will transpire. These executive orders, if implemented, will make our air dirtier, our population sicker, our energy more expensive, and our communities less prepared for extreme weather. The constitutionality of these orders will be challenged in court, and some require congressional action. But to the extent they survive these challenges, these orders will steeply raise the level of climate risk all of us face. So, what's a citizen of Planet Earth to do? A few decades ago, when I was first starting to pay attention to the environmental movement, a prominent slogan was, \"Think globally, act locally.\" Straightforward and logical, sure. But also, as a judgemental teenager, it struck me as sort of corny -- and inadequate given the epic challenges we face. I didn't fully appreciate the depth of the message until quite recently. And now, in the context of federal obstructionism, the slogan is more apt than ever. As a marine biologist and climate policy wonk, when I imagine effective local actions, my thoughts gravitate to ways coastal communities can increase their resilience in the face of now-inevitable climate impacts, like high risk of flooding from hurricanes, sea level rise, and extreme rainfall, which are worsened by their outdated infrastructure, impermeable surfaces, and loss of ecosystems. These hazards aren't just future predictions. In 2024 a warmer ocean fueled stronger hurricanes, making winds speeds up to 28 mph faster, and causing well over $100 billion in economic losses. Meanwhile, on the flip side, ocean-climate solutions -- from offshore renewable energy to decarbonizing shipping to regenerative ocean farming to protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems -- have the potential to provide 35 percent of emissions reductions needed by 2050. Forty percent of Americans live in coastal counties. Twenty percent of Americans -- one-in-five -- live in coastal cities, and the demographics are far from elite. In this moment, when the executive branch is checking off everything on the wishlists of fossil fuel CEOs and abdicating its responsibility to keep Americans safe from dangerous extreme weather, it's city governments' time to shine. This is the focus of Urban Ocean Lab , the nonprofit think tank I co-founded and co-lead, where we've put together a Climate Readiness Framework for Coastal Cities that includes over 70 recommendations to help local governments better prepare for the future, along with an open-access resource hub stocked with hundreds of documents that can help city governments understand best practices and make informed decisions -- including documents we rushed to archive before the inauguration, some of which have indeed since been deleted from federal websites. Many cities are already taking bold climate actions of the sort we'll need to ramp up. They are speeding the transition to renewable energy by improving battery capacity and transmission systems, including for offshore wind energy. (Example: Portland, Maine's One Climate Future Plan .) They are ensuring coastal development does not destroy wetlands, ecosystems which can offer more cost-effective coastal protection than seawalls. (Example: Boston's Wetlands Protection Ordinance .) They are ensuring that planning and zoning codes and construction standards take into account climate shocks like cloudbursts, storm surges, and heat waves, and also protect working waterfronts . (Example: New York City's Comprehensive Waterfront Plan .) They are fostering local resilience in partnership with community-based organizations -- embracing social cohesion as a climate strategy . (Example: Oakland's Equitable Climate Action Plan .) And they are planning for climate-driven relocation -- it's time to face the music; we can't keep reflexively rebuilding in the same places. (Example: Charleston's Flooding and Sea Level Rise Strategy .) Of course, states have a major role to play, too, including providing tax incentives and funding for green jobs and green infrastructure, strengthening ecosystem protections, developing buyout processes for flood-prone homes, facilitating inter-city and regional coordination, and holding polluters accountable. To be clear, federal resources would obviously be a massive help, and we absolutely must hold the executive branch accountable. Fundamentally, preventing this administration from destroying our democratic institutions is critical to addressing the climate crisis. Still, there is so much city and state governments can do to implement climate solutions without federal support. Now what can a regular person do to push cities and states to fill the growing federal void? A lot. I share heaps of examples in my book What If We Get It Right? But, for now, let's focus on just one key action: Join a local environmental group. In other words, find a home, a community, for your planet-protecting, life-sustaining work, and settle in for the long haul. This is no trite step. In the words of Bill McKibben, climate journalist and activist, \"Faced with the kind of crises that we face, the most important thing that an individual can do is to not always be an individual.\" More of us must find more ways to speak with a collective, coordinated voice -- at city council meetings and planning board meetings and utility commission meetings, and in support of local climate candidates . There are many environmental groups all over the country. If you don't know where to start, seek out your local chapter of: Sunrise Movement (for youth), Third Act (for seniors), and (for all) Citizens Climate Lobby , 350.org , Surfrider , and the Sierra Club . Apart from the dire situation at the federal level, there are lots of other compelling reasons to put your energies into local climate action. Focusing on change in your own city or state often leads to deep and rewarding connections with the environment and communities that surround you. In many cases, it's easier to get traction for local than national efforts, and the impact of your work can be gratifyingly tangible and direct. In addition to \"act locally,\" another phrase I'm only now coming to fully appreciate is \"an inconvenient truth,\" the title of Al Gore's film. The truth of climate change is indeed wildly inconvenient; addressing it requires not just tweaking but transforming corporate practices, government policies, and cultural norms. (See, for example: single-use plastic, fast fashion, composting, and factory farming.) To call the retrograde direction of our federal climate policy 'inconvenient\" would be an extreme euphemism. Well, here we are. And, to quote poet June Jordan, we are the ones we've been waiting for.\n",

      "At a town hall event on Saturday in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as Elon Musk continued his tour of the state in support of Donald Trump , the topic of immigration came up. That in itself was hardly unusual -- Musk, Trump, and the entire MAGA movement have been demonizing immigrants throughout the 2024 election cycle. But this time, someone wanted Musk, born in South Africa, to share what he had learned in becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen himself. A question came from an audience member named Mark, who told the billionaire that it had taken \"years and money\" for his wife to be naturalized \"the right way.\" He then asked if Musk would talk about his experience with the immigration system. Musk seemed unprepared to address his own story and stammered a bit, saying: \"Yeah, well, since your wife has gone through the, um, process of becoming a citizen and getting [a] Green Card, it's -- you've seen how absurdly slow and arduous it is.\" He then quickly shifted into metaphors for how he wants immigration to work, saying we should think about it as picking people to join a company or sports team. \"You know, it's like, I mean, it's like, if, like, if you have the opportunity to say, have like, you know, LeBron James or Steph Curry on your team, you'd be like, 'Yeah, that would make total sense.'\" The country should welcome immigrants, Musk said, who are \"productive and honest and a net contributor.\" Musk said nothing about his own time as an immigrant in the U.S. and did not clarify why he believes, as he put it, that \"it is easier to get into this country as a murderer than as a Nobel Laureate.\" Indeed, his consistent description of the legal U.S. immigration path as a \" laborious Kafkaesque nightmare \" should probably allay his fears that Democrats are somehow funneling migrants illegally over the border and directly into voting booths . Yet, instead of discussing the specific obstacles he faced and how they can be addressed, he joked that the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A should oversee U.S. borders, because \"they are so efficient\" and \"the chicken sandwiches are epic.\" Musk added, \"That's going to be a headline.\" He was right, and the articles about his appearance in Lancaster focused on the bizarre Chick-fil-A comments , as well as his discussion of space aliens -- not the side-stepping of his personal history. If Musk was eager to give the media something else to chew on, it could have been because the Washington Post had published a story that morning about how he had worked illegally in the U.S. at his startup company Zip2 after bailing on a Stanford University graduate program in 1995, thereby invalidating a student visa. \"Actually, I didn't really care much for the degree, but I had no money for a lab and no legal right to stay in the country, so that seemed like a good way to solve both issues,\" he wrote in a 2005 email that came to light in an unrelated lawsuit that has since been settled. Musk never actually enrolled in Stanford classes. Later on Saturday night, after President Biden took aim at Musk for the hypocrisy of railing against undocumented immigrants despite having allegedly violated immigration law himself, Musk posted on X that he \" was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B ,\" and \" was in fact allowed to work \" in the U.S. The J-1 is an academic visa that requires the holder to be engaged in study, teaching, or research, and to have a federally designated exchange sponsor -- often a university. Musk didn't explain whether his J-1 was sponsored by Stanford or the University of Pennsylvania, where he had previously completed his undergraduate degree. But in either case, according to immigration attorney Greg Siskind, author of multiple editions of the primary guide to J-1 visas, Musk would have had illegal status and lacked authorization to work the moment he dropped out of school. \"If he successfully transitioned to H-1B status,\" Siskind posted on X, \"it was because he either left the country and reentered in that status or he lied to USCIS (then the INS) about his status.\" An H-1B (not \"H1-B,\" as Musk styled it) is a temporary employment visa that authorizes the holder to work in \"specialty occupations.\" Musk has also not revealed just how he converted to this status. The broad strokes of Musk's immigration journey are clear: He obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born there, and then came to the U.S. on a visa to study at Penn in 1992. Ten years later, in 2002, he gained U.S. citizenship. Yet he has kept his immigration status right after the end of his academic life rather fuzzy, even at one point referring to it as \" a gray area \" -- this in a 2013 interview in which his brother and co-founder in the startup Zip2, Kimbal Musk, openly stated that they were \"illegal immigrants.\" When a venture capital firm committed $3 million in funding to their company in 1996, the Post reported, the funding agreement required that the Musks obtain legal work status within 45 days. Zip2 board members also worried that the pair could be deported. Being more transparent on the steps he took toward naturalization would make Musk a more credible voice on the topic, particularly if he wants to keep arguing that the U.S. procedure puts individuals through a bloated and broken bureaucracy. The trouble is, his own story might demonstrate that it is far easier for the son of a white, wealthy, well-connected foreign family to skirt the technicalities of immigration law than it is for a non-white migrant to illegally cross the southern border and gain access to public resources such as schools, hospitals, and benefits programs. Trump's campaign, of course, has relied on racist tropes about such migrants pouring in to the country, overwhelming municipal infrastructure, and leeching off assistance programs like welfare. In other words, the immigrant experience Musk didn't want to address when asked to over the weekend would likely have taken him off-message as he stumped for Trump. So he stumbled through a naive and oversimplified non-answer about how we should take in immigrants who are like NBA superstars, then threw the smoke bomb of the Chick-fil-A premise to ensure that the coverage would frame him as absurd rather than evasive. It makes perfect sense, though: Trump has never said anything accurate or constructive on the issue of immigration, so why should his loudest mega-donor? When it comes to creating a panic, the details only get in the way.\n"

      "Donald Trump led a virulently anti-immigrant campaign for president, fixated on the idea of \"migrant crime\" and the notion that foreigners are \"taking your jobs.\" The president-elect and his incoming administration remain committed to deporting undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers -- but Trump has already made clear he won't stop big employers from replacing Americans with temporary immigrant workers. The president-elect recently sided with ultra-wealthy supporters Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy over MAGA fans online regarding the question of whether Big Tech firms need foreign workers. Musk and Ramaswamy, like Trump, have frequently demonized undocumented immigrants; Musk ran pro-Trump ads decrying a \"HISTORIC BORDER INVASION\" and \"illegal immigrants getting handouts.\" Now, Musk says the H-1B visa program for high-skilled workers is how companies make America \"strong,\" and has demanded that \"racists\" be purged from the Republican Party. Trump, the left, and the right have long criticized the H-1B visa program for allowing massive, highly profitable companies to rely on cheaper foreign labor. Trump previously called H-1B visas \"very bad\" and \"unfair for our workers,\" and sought to crack down on the visa program during his first term. He's quickly changed his tune: \"I've always liked the visas,\" Trump said recently, asserting: \"I have many H-1B visas on my properties.\" On Tuesday, he argued, \"I didn't change my mind. I always felt we have to have the most competent people in our country.\" He added, \"We need smart people coming into our country.\" This dramatic reversal makes exactly clear what Trump's second term will and won't be about. Trump and his allies intend to punish the vulnerable and enrich the mega-wealthy -- particularly his friends and himself. This policy project will have two tiers: an empty hand or a fist for people in need, and a generous hand-up for voracious billionaires and executives -- even if it means irking some of his stridently anti-immigrant supporters. In some cases, this policy approach will look like an explicit trade: directly robbing the poor to give to the rich. There has been indication already , during the lead-up period to Trump 2.0, that his administration intends to gut America's meager social safety net -- and make it even harder for the poorest Americans to access Medicaid health insurance coverage and food stamps -- in order to fund another round of tax cuts for America's wealthiest individuals and big corporations. Despite Trump and Republicans' ongoing insistence that they stand for the working man and woman, the president-elect and his close advisers have long weighed dramatic spending cuts that would affect vital services and programs that poor and working-class Americans rely on to survive. And with a second term on the horizon, much of the MAGAland upper crust and the Republican elite are hoping to finish the job they started in Trump's first go around. \"There is a large amount of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid,\" says a Trump adviser who's discussed these matters recently with him. \"President Trump will be having a look at that.\" Trump has pledged to impose tariffs of anywhere between 10 and 20 percent on all imported goods -- a policy that would certainly cause companies to raise prices for consumers, at a time when many Americans are already struggling to pay for basic household expenses. Yet, corporate America isn't sweating a second Trump era, and that's not just because so many industry titans, billionaires, and mega-millionaires are ardent Republicans, gave lavishly to get him elected, or have shoveled big money into the Trump coffers and inauguration fund. During this presidential transition, Trump has already spoken privately -- including with some high-powered business leaders -- about major companies securing exclusions from Trump's potentially sweeping tariffs regime, two people with knowledge of the matter say. In one recent instance, the president-elect joked to an industry leader that what corporate giants need to do as they scramble for tariff exemptions is get a meeting with Trump and \"ask me nicely,\" one of the sources says. Disturbingly, Trump's supposed joke here sounds similar to his demands to state governors during his first term that they ask him \" nicely \" if they needed emergency assistance or life-or-death disaster relief from the federal government -- or else he might just deny them aid . Some corporate entities and business interests are committing to non-conventional routes for staying in Trump's good graces and getting what they want out of his administration's coming crackdowns and standoffs. According to one Republican source with direct knowledge of the matter, a major industry lobbying group they work with has already actively explored booking a number of upcoming events at Trump-brand properties, in a blatant attempt to put money in Trump and his family business empire's pocket. \"There's no Trump Hotel [in Washington, D.C.] anymore, but there are plenty of other options in different, convenient states,\" this person adds. In the new Trump era, corporations and the ultra-wealthy will get what they want, so long as they pay for it. The most vulnerable people in this country, though, stand to lose what little they have.\n",

      "After two years of tracking anything and everything happening with abortion rights in a daily newsletter , I've outlined the most important, urgent, and useful information in my new book: Abortion: Our Bodies, Their Lies, and the Truths We Use to Win . In a moment when anti-abortion legislators and activists are launching attack after attack, my objective became to provide order to the chaos, and to cut through conservative misinformation and lies to reveal what their real endgame is for American women. There's perhaps is no better example of those lies than abortion ban \"exceptions.\" Before reading this excerpt, though, please know this: While exceptions were deliberately crafted in ways to discourage their use, it doesn't mean you shouldn't try. There are organizations in every state dedicated to ensuring that you can get the care you need; they can help you navigate the policies in your state and direct you to the best places for support. You can find some of those groups linked here. And remember: The relentless attacks on our rights and freedoms aren't just meant to turn back the clock for women, but to exhaust us into inaction. Anti-abortion politicians want us to be so overwhelmed reading story after story about raped children denied care, or women going septic, that we won't notice what they're doing behind the scenes. My hope is that Abortion will help with that overwhelm -- arming readers with the information, language, and context they need to fight back. *** Mississippi has an abortion ban exception for rape victims. At least, it's supposed to. But in 2022, when investigative reporters from Mississippi Today went looking for a doctor who would provide a rape or incest victim with an abortion, they couldn't find one. Not a single doctor in the state was willing to end the pregnancy of a sexual violence victim. And that's the truth of \"exceptions\" in a nutshell; they exist only on paper. To put it simply: they're not real. In Louisiana, a woman was denied an abortion despite the fact that her fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a fatal condition specifically named in the state's list of \"exceptions.\" And even though Texas's ban allows abortions if someone's life is endangered or if there would be a \"substantial impairment of major bodily function,\" Amanda Zurawski wasn't given an abortion until she was in the ICU with sepsis. Another Texas woman, a twenty-five-year-old whose doomed pregnancy was making her increasingly ill, was told by doctors she'd need to have a stroke before she could come back for an abortion. And these are just the stories we know about. None of these nightmares was an accident. Abortion ban \"exceptions\" are deliberately crafted to be impossible to use. In fact, the only reason they exist at all is to make Republicans seem a little less punishing. As the Guttmacher Institute's Elizabeth Nash says, \"Exceptions function mainly as PR tools to make abortion bans seem less cruel than they are and [to] distract from the inhumanity of the ban itself. The truth is that when Republicans sit down to write \"exceptions,\" they do so with the sole intent of excluding as many people as possible. What's one of the best-known facts about sexual assault survivors? That they overwhelmingly don't report their attacks to law enforcement. The shame, fear of victim-blaming, and trepidation over the criminal justice system keeps more than two out of three victims from going to police. So when Republican legislators write a law that's supposed to help these victims get care, what do they do? They include a requirement that the attacks must be reported to law enforcement. That's what I mean when I say lawmakers are carefully crafting these laws to never be used. We also know that it often takes rape and incest victims time to come to terms with their attack; trauma isn't processed overnight. It's common for those who've been attacked to be in denial about a rape-related pregnancy; this is especially true when victims are younger or have been assaulted by a family member. So, Republicans add in a time limitation for rape victims to get care. In some states, GOP legislators have written \"exceptions\" that purposefully terrify sexual violence victims. Before a South Carolina doctor can perform an abortion on a rape victim -- assuming you can find a doctor willing to perform an abortion at all -- they have to inform the patient that their name, information, and the details of their allegation will be reported to the local sheriff. Leaving aside for a moment that outrageous breach in confidentiality, this is a clear way to scare rape victims away from having abortions. The law forces victims to go to the police regardless of whether they want to, and it contains an implied threat. Telling victims they'll be reported to police gives the impression that if they're not believed about their attack, they'll be punished. It's bullying. Some Republicans are eager to make that threat of punishment even more explicit. Tennessee doesn't have an abortion ban \"exception\" for rape victims, but when Republicans were briefly considering one, it included this telling mandate: any woman who the state believed made a false report would be guilty of a felony and would have to serve a minimum of three years in prison. To put it plainly, anti-abortion legislators are relying on American victim-blaming to ensure that victims can't get care. Iowa's state medical board guidelines require doctors who are considering giving a victim an abortion to determine whether the attack is \"prosecutable.\" And these are just the laws that apply to adults. The week that I sat down to write this chapter, Tennessee Republicans voted to force children twelve and under to carry pregnancies to term after being raped. Every single House Republican voted down an \"exception\" that would have allowed raped children to get care. Anti-abortion lawmakers and activists also claim that pregnancy after rape is rare -- a claim designed to hide their utter cruelty, and to pivot when asked about abortion ban exceptions. Some even say that women can't get pregnant from a rape at all. Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins -- who has been celebrated as the future of the anti-abortion movement -- says that \"sexual assault actually helps prevent a lot of pregnancies itself because of your body's natural response.\" There's a reason that conservatives consistently downplay how many women and girls are raped: they know that Americans very much oppose sexual violence victims being forced into childbirth. Anti-abortion lawmakers and activists believe that if they pretend that rape-related pregnancy -- or rape in general -- is rare, they can hide their extremism. But a 2024 study estimated that there were 65,000 rape-related pregnancies in the fourteen states that banned abortion after Dobbs . Sixty-five thousand. The researchers used data from the CDC, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and FBI Uniform Crime Reports to come up with their estimate. One of the study's authors, Dr. Samuel Dickman, told NPR he was \"horrified\" seeing the numbers. \"Sexual assault is incredibly common -- I knew that in a general sense. But to be confronted with these estimates that are so high in states where there's no meaningful abortion access? It's hard to comprehend.\" One of the more brutal Republican policies are so-called exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies -- conditions that will result in a fetus dying in utero or after birth. Since Dobbs, anti-abortion groups and lawmakers have launched a quiet campaign to do away with any exceptions for fatal fetal conditions and to pressure women in states with exceptions to carry their nonviable pregnancies to term, regardless of the law. Republicans have to be sly about this particular initiative. They know that Americans are furious over stories like Kate Cox's, the Texas woman denied an abortion despite a life-threatening pregnancy. Cox's story went internationally viral in 2023 after she was unable to get an abortion in her home state, even though she was diagnosed with a dangerous and nonviable pregnancy. With the help of the Center for Reproductive Rights, Cox filed for an emergency order asking for an abortion, a plea to prevent her baby's suffering and to end her own. In a just world, it would be unthinkable for a woman to have to beg the courts for such a thing. But Cox doesn't live in a just world -- she lives in Texas. And so she and her lawyers hoped that her obviously dire circumstances would clear the way for her to get care. Instead, the state fought Cox's request: lawyers for Texas claimed her life wasn't sufficiently at risk, arguing that \"countless women ... give birth every day with similar medical histories.\" As if this nightmare pregnancy was just business per usual. The state didn't even bother to address the fact that the pregnancy was nonviable, because Texas doesn't have an exception for fatal fetal conditions. Still, a sympathetic judge -- who got emotional during her ruling -- granted Cox's request. She called what the law was doing to Cox a \"genuine miscarriage of justice.\" That ruling didn't stand for long, though. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton soon sprang into action, asking the state supreme court to reverse the judge's decision. All to prevent one single woman from getting care. Paxton was so intent on forcing Cox to carry this pregnancy, in fact, that he sent letters to three hospitals in Houston, threatening them with criminal charges if they provided or assisted in giving her an abortion. Cox's story sparked fury across the country. Americans saw, firsthand, exactly what anti-abortion politicians wanted for them and their families. Republican legislators tried to run from questions about Cox -- in one case, literally. When a reporter attempted to ask Senator Ted Cruz what he thought about Cox's experience, the senator took off in a sprint. Nikki Haley said she believed the Texas law should be changed, but neglected to mention that she supported a national ban that would do to all American women what Texas did to Cox. One after another, Republicans showed their true colors. In the end, so did Texas. The state supreme court ultimately sided with Paxton, reversing the judge's order and blocking Cox from getting an abortion in her home state. And so the thirty-one-year-old mother of two did what most people in her situation would do if they had the ability -- she left Texas to get the care she needed. In addition to trying to do away with exceptions for nonviable pregnancies altogether, Republican legislators make those \"exceptions\" impossible to use. One of the GOP's tactics is to claim that excep-tions exists for nonviable pregnancies, while narrowly defining what constitutes a nonviable pregnancy so that virtually no one can qualify. North Carolina's abortion ban, for one, requires severe fetal abnormalities to be \"uniformly diagnosable\" -- an impossible black- and-white standard that applies only to a small handful of nonviable conditions. Other states define a nonviable pregnancy as one in which a newborn would die immediately upon birth or \"imminently\" thereafter. That language is vague enough that legislators can argue that a newborn who would live only for a few days doesn't have a \"fatal\" condition. Then there are the states that deliberately include no language at all about what constitutes a fatal diagnosis. The point here is to put doctors in the position of having to decide if they're willing to risk their license and freedom on the chance that a fetus isn't viable -- and that a court of law would agree with that diagnosis. What this means in reality is truly shocking: Parents forced to \"prove\" that a baby born without a skull is, in fact, going to die. Mothers wondering if their daughter's condition constitutes being \"lethal\" because she'll survive a few days rather than a few hours. People who might otherwise be able to grieve and recover at home in peace being forced to make their cases with lawyers in courtrooms. How is any of this \"pro-life\"? What's most shocking about these \"exceptions\" is that they allow conservatives to pretend as if they're generously allowing vulnerable women abortions, even as they force them to beg for care. Cultivating that illusion of empathy is central to everything the GOP does when it comes to abortion. That's why Republicans frame their \"exceptions\" as policies that help and protect women. Anti-abortion states increasingly require that women with nonviable pregnancies be given resources about what the law calls \"prenatal counseling\" and \"perinatal hospice care.\" This sounds innocuous enough, but those terms are code for something much more insidious: anti-abortion groups posing as counselors and experts. Dr. Robin Pierucci, who works with the \"prenatal counseling\" group Be Not Afraid, says, \"I love reminding them that the first diagnosis is 'It's a baby,' and no other diagnosis ever negates diagnosis number one. The baby is inherently valuable and worthy of our love.\" Imagine getting perhaps the worst news of your life -- finding out that your pregnancy isn't viable -- and having a cheerful doctor come into the room and say \"congratulations.\" Now imagine that women weren't just directed to people and groups like this -- they were required to be \"counseled\" by them. That's what anti-abortion organizations and lawmakers are working on right now. Even if rape victims or patients with nonviable pregnancies can't get abortions, surely Republicans would want those whose health or lives are endangered to be able to get care. Surely? Not even close. Every woman who has come forward with a painful story of being denied care has lived in a state that claims to make allowances for women's health; but when push comes to shove, they're unable to get care. They're not sick enough, or not close enough to death. Doctors around the country find themselves in the position of weighing their medical license and their freedom -- against whether or not they should provide an abortion at that moment, or wait until their patient is just a little bit sicker. If you were risking years in prison -- decades, even -- what would you choose? There's perhaps no better example of the failure of health and life exceptions than Tennessee. When Roe was first overturned, the state didn't even have an allowance for women's lives. Instead, the state had an affirmative defense mandate: a law that required doctors giving life-saving abortions to break the law and then later prove it was necessary. In 2022 a Tennessee woman with an ectopic pregnancy had to wait hours while lawyers at the hospital put together a legal justification for her treatment. Ectopic pregnancies are nonviable and deadly for the pregnant person. But because of Tennessee's law, doctors had to stop and prepare a legal defense before giving her care. As the woman described to the Nashville Scene, she, her husband, and other family members spent those hours trying to find hospitals in another state in case she was refused. In the end, the doctors treated her, but they had to break the law in order to do so: \"It's a felony, what they did, and that is crazy to me. So while I'm recovering from surgery, and trying to emotionally process all of it, another layer of it was, what if my case wasn't severe enough, right? And what if a prosecutor decides, 'Well, we want to make an example.' Like, what if I wasn't bleeding internally enough?\" Maternal-fetal medicine specialist Dr. Sarah Osmundson wrote, in an op-ed in The New York Times, that the law was \"intended to be ambiguous and confusing, to make physicians scared to provide abortion care.\" She sits on the abortion committee at Vanderbilt University Medical Center -- the group of ob-gyns and maternal-fetal medicine specialists who decide whether a patient is close enough to death to warrant care. She told Pro- Publica reporter Kavitha Surana how the committee members send each other urgent text messages, at all hours, to sign off on emergency life-saving care. She recounted cases where the committee had to deny women care despite serious illness, like a patient whose pregnancy complications meant she could end up with an ostomy bag or sepsis. The issue was that the woman wasn't in immediate danger. If she was given an abortion, a conservative prosecutor could later decide that the patient hadn't really needed it and that doctors were guilty of a felony. This is just one state, and the politics of just under two years. The same thing is happening everywhere. When Idaho Republicans wrote language to \"clarify\" the state's abortion ban, they declined to include an exception for \"life-threatening conditions.\" Why? Republican state representative Julianne Young said, \"The list was endless when we began considering the decisions that would fall under that language.\" That's right, when faced with the fact that there are an \"endless\" number of things that can go wrong during pregnancy and put someone's life at risk -- conservative lawmakers simply opted to leave out any allowance for them at all. If the point is to ensure that patients can't use abortion ban exceptions, why include them at all? The truth is that when it comes to abortion rights, Republicans are desperate. The GOP has been struggling with how to talk about abortion at all, and conservative strategists think \"exceptions\" are the answer. Because the only thing more popular than broad access to abortion rights is abortion for sexual violence victims and those whose health and lives are in danger. The polling is astronomical, even in red states, and even among Republican voters. By focusing on exceptions, Republican legislators would finally have an abortion stance that's popular. (That's why Donald Trump has been talking so much about exceptions in the lead-up to the 2024 election.) Best of all for lawmakers, exceptions allow them to feign empathy and \"reasonableness\" without actually giving anything up police-wise because they know that their exceptions don't work. For them, it's a win-win. The other reason Republicans love \"exceptions,\" though, is that they allow them to tap into American misogyny. After all, the very idea of exceptions is built on the notion that some women deserve care while others don't. Those who have sex willingly are bad girls who should be punished; those who were forced, or who are sick, get a reprieve. This is where Democrats and the pro-choice movement have a real opportunity to push back. We should be raising the alarm again and again about how exceptions aren't real; but we also have the ability to point out the misogynist absurdity and hypocrisy of exceptions. If a fertilized egg is a life, and abortion is murder, why do the circumstances for abortion matter? (At least the anti-abortion extremists who don't want exceptions at all are ideologically consistent.) What that means, however, is that Democrats need to get comfortable advocating for zero government interference in pregnancy. We have to let go of \"exceptions,\" too. There's never been a better time to do so. In fact, it's downright shameful we haven't already. Given how unpopular abortion bans are, how is it possible that the GOP is still framing the debate on abortion? It's absurd that the national conversation has become a question of when it's fair to legislate someone's body. With voters more furious and pro-choice than ever, the most effective message is also the only appropriate answer: never. Every abortion denied is a tragedy. You don't have to go into sepsis to be forever harmed by an abortion ban. You don't need to be raped to have control of your body stolen from you. And while the most extreme consequences of abortion bans do happen with shocking regularity, they are still outliers: Most people seek out abortions because they don't want to be pregnant. And that's okay -- in fact, it's critical. Reproductive rights and justice isn't about who \"deserves\" care, or who has endured enough suffering to have \"earned\" an abortion. Forcing anyone to be pregnant against their will, for any reason, is immoral and cruel.

      "Outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, a gust of wind blew away Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's notes Monday. It was moments before he was to announce his resignation as head of the Liberal Party and his exit from the PM's office after nine years in power. It was a too easy metaphor of how Trudeau's hopes for an enlightened new Canada -- a counterbalance to Donald Trump 's America -- cut and run as only dreams can. I wrote about Trudeau for a Rolling Stone cover story in 2017 in an admittedly overly credulous profile (not to mention that I was pilloried for saying Canada was protected by two vast oceans instead of three, forgetting, uh, the Arctic Ocean). The profile is a product of its time. Six months into the first Trump term, things were so desperate that an American magazine put a Canadian on the cover because he was handsome, had normal hair, and did not see nonwhite immigrants as an existential threat. The contrast was strong: Trump instituted a travel ban, while Trudeau met Syrian refugees at the airport with hugs. Eight days after Trump was inaugurated, Trudeau tweeted , \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength.\" There was more. Trudeau, the son of a prime minister, had come to power in 2015 on a slogan of \"sunny ways\" and his cabinet featured more women than men. (When asked why this was so, Trudeau responded, \"Because it's 2015.\") There was a hint of Barack Obama in Trudeau who was also young, handsome, and progressive. America was closing down and Canada was opening up, and the country experienced a version of the \"Cool Britannia\" that swept the United Kingdom when Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997. Now, it has similarly ended in pieces. One of the key differences between Trudeau and Obama was that Obama was not born to the manor. Trudeau's birth on Christmas Day 1971 was a national event, the first son of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his impossibly glamorous wife, Margaret. (Before the decade was over, she would be dancing at Studio 54 and palling around with the Rolling Stones.) After his parents separated, Trudeau and his two brothers were raised in a stately Montreal home, where his dad decreed on which floors English would be spoken and on which floors only French was allowed. His tween years were spent accompanying his dad on state visits and international trips, and while it might not have been as traumatic as Keith Richards taking his son Marlon on the road with the Stones at the same age, it's the kind of upbringing that can leave scars and skew reality. In his twenties, the younger Trudeau was seen as a bit of a himbo, a pretty-boy lightweight whose gravitas was less than one of his father's trenchcoats. He worked as a snowboard instructor, tried his hand at acting, before settling in as school teacher in Vancouver. Ironically, it was Trudeau's eulogy for his father in 2000 that established him as a serious person. His father died of prostate cancer, but Trudeau told me it was from a broken heart after the death of his brother Michel in an avalanche in 1998. \"I watched it kill my dad,\" Trudeau told me. \"He just lost it. He couldn't understand why God had taken his son away from him like that.\" Before his father's funeral, Trudeau gathered his friends together and wrote a memorable eulogy ending with a Robert Frost line: \"He has kept his promises and earned his sleep.\" He began to cry and shake. \" Je t'aime, Papa ,\" he said and rested his forehead on his father's flag-draped coffin. His rise still wasn't inevitable but it seemed possible. Then, comically, Trudeau was propelled by a victory in a 2012 celebrity boxing match over a meatier Conservative foe who happened to be an indigenous Canadian. (Canadians are bilingual, but their politics can be just as shallow as their American neighbors.) When I interviewed him in 2017, Trudeau bragged about the calculation behind the match, which should have been a warning sign of a Blair-like cynicism that would cause him trouble as prime minister. \"It wasn't random,\" Trudeau told me. \"I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\" There were early victories, notably an attempt to pivot Canada, a top world oil producer, to a more climate aware country with the passing of a carbon tax that won global praise but absolute visceral rage from Canada's prairie provinces, particularly Alberta with its vast oil sands. Canada did become a safe haven during the first Trump years. Women in power became a fact of life, not a sop for votes. He helped create a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation for indigenous Canadians, an attempt to correct the wrongs of 200 years of colonialism that featured the taking of children from their families and sending them to residential schools where they endured abuse and sometimes death. But the soaring rhetoric and ideals only took Trudeau so far. He ran on a pledge to provide safe drinking water to indigenous Canadians, but almost a decade later, boil-water mandates still remain in some communities. Just as damning, Trudeau was found not to practice what he preached. In 2019, an ethics commission found he had worked \"to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\" the former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, when he urged her to inflict a civil penalty rather than a criminal prosecution to an influential Canadian engineering firm involved in a bribery scandal. Wilson-Raybould was Trudeau's highest ranking indigenous minister. He apologized, but Wilson-Raybould still resigned from Trudeau's party. Later that year, photos emerged of Trudeau in brownface as Aladdin at a 2001 Halloween party. It was a pattern of do as I say, not as I do again highlighted by the first official Truth and Reconciliation Day in 2021. Trudeau spent it on a family vacation rather than participating in remembrance ceremonies. Covid hit in 2020, and Trudeau again flashed the good and bad Justin. He became the first world leader to isolate himself after his wife, Sophie, suffered with Covid. Trudeau and Canada at first exemplified grace under pressure that American pissed away as most of the country masked up and schools remained largely open after the first wave passed. But then he undermined his credibility by calling an election in 2021 to press a political advantage just as he was urging his citizens not to congregate in large groups. The ploy backfired with no real change from a 2019 election, but created a growing feeling that Trudeau's personal goals were diverging from the national interest. From there, Trudeau suffered the slings and arrows of inflation and a violent reaction to his vaccine policies. He required that Canadian truckers be vaccinated if they were going to drive from province to province. Conservative activists saw an opening. A well-orchestrated group of truckers descended on Ottawa in January 2022 creating a Jan. 6 Lite experience, blockading the capital for a week blowing their horns making the city unworkable and borderline unlivable for days. Trudeau eventually had to use sweeping emergency powers to end the crisis, further raising the rage and bile of his populist opponents. The two years since then has seen Trudeau and the Liberal Party's slide in the polls amid calls for Trudeau to leave the stage. Like Joe Biden before him, Trudeau refused in a final act of denial and narcissism, claiming that only his personal leadership could save his party and the country. That was exactly wrong. The final blow happened before Christmas, when Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland resigned in a dispute over budget tricks Trudeau was using in hopes of goosing his popularity as his party's approval ratings fell into the teens. Freeland was the most prominent woman in Trudeau's government and had previously served as his deputy prime minister. She had led his efforts to reform Canada's NAFTA rules, keep Trump tariffs at bay, and spearheaded Canada's strong support of Ukraine after Putin's invasion. Her departure was a definitive sign that it was time for Trudeau to go that even he could not ignore. Sadly, like Biden before him, it is too late. Trudeau's delay leaves his eventual successor with no time to separate themselves from his reign, and the Liberal Party is barreling toward a catastrophic wipeout in a spring or summer election. Trudeau heads into tariff negotiations as the lamest of lame ducks as Trump taunts him on social media calling him governor of Canada, the 51 st state of America. Now estranged from his wife, Trudeau is all alone. It was a far cry from when I traveled with him to New Brunswick in 2017 for the Acadian Games. There, Trudeau was swarmed Hard Day's Night style. It was a level of adulation I'd never seen with a politician and, yes, Obama-esque if Obama were ever allowed to wade into such uncontrolled mayhem. The day ended with another round of universal praise at a nearby ice cream social. But then something happened. We left for the airport, and the motorcade detoured onto a dirt road. I wondered if there was a crisis or a security threat. And then Trudeau rolled down his window and dropped his ice cream cone in the dirt. He didn't want to be seen littering on a Canadian highway. Image had overtaken the actual man. The sunny ways would soon be behind him.\n"

      "Margaret Klein Salamon, Ph.D., is the Executive Director of Climate Emergency Fund , which raises funds for and makes grants to non violent climate activists. She is the Author of Facing the Climate Emergency: How to Transform Yourself with Climate Truth . Who is to blame for the Los Angeles fires ? For the destruction of Asheville? The devastation of Acapulco? If you listen to the mainstream media, you would get the impression that no one is truly responsible. These are framed as tragic but random events- acts of nature without clear cause or accountability. Even if articles do mention climate change, which they tend to bury toward the end, they won't tell you the people and companies who caused these disasters in order to enrich themselves. And if you listen to right-wingers, you will get the mistaken impression that DEI , arson, and the California Democratic Party caused these disasters. But here's the truth: These mega-disasters are caused by the climate emergency, which has been caused by fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industry has raked in obscene profits for decades, while knowingly bringing down apocalypse onto the rest of us. We have the power to change the narrative. Imagine this: As fires rage through the city, a group of climate activists non-violently occupy the California State House in Sacramento. Or LA City Hall. Or Marathon Oil's refinery in Los Angeles County. They would demand that fossil fuel companies pay for the damage they're causing, and face criminal prosecution for the harm that they have inflicted. Such a protest would be covered on front pages across the globe, shifting the narrative from passive victimhood to active accountability. This is an opportunity that the climate movement has yet to fully seize. The climate emergency is accelerating, and so is the frequency and scale of disasters. When these disasters occur, the eyes of the country and sometimes the world focus on the crisis and its fallout. This should be a tremendous learning opportunity for the public about the dangers of the climate emergency, but the media obscures the true cause of these events. While truthful headlines would report along the lines of, \"The Climate Emergency Strikes Again,\" the media continues to largely report these disasters as anomalous weather events. Activists have a unique role to play in these moments. By connecting fossil fuels to the damage we're seeing -- floods, fires, hurricanes -- they can elevate the conversation and force the public to reckon with the reality of the climate emergency. Activists can also call for proactive policies: investments in renewable energy, phasing out fossil fuels, and sustainable rebuilding efforts. The \"Make Polluters Pay\" demand, which New York State just passed after facing pressure from the New York climate movement, offers a compelling framework for justice in the wake of climate disasters. With millions or even billions of dollars in damage, justice demands that the culprits -- fossil fuel companies who have knowingly warmed the atmosphere for decades -- foot the bill. Disasters are opportunities to shape long-term policy change. Disasters create a unique moment when the public and politicians are more open to new ideas and transformative policy changes. Naomi Klein argued for the unique political opportunities that disasters open up in her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism . Activists can use this moment to demand not only immediate relief but also policies that challenge the fossil fuel industry's grip on power. Climate Emergency Fund is dedicated to supporting the nonviolent disruptive activists who are pushing these important conversations forward, through raising money and making grants. We saw an example of how climate protest can determine the narrative around climate disaster by accident -- we supported a protest of Burning Man. The protest wasn't terribly successful until Burning Man flooded and became a mud pit. Stories about the disaster, which were quite widespread, harkened back to or were even framed around the protest . This made the coverage more climate-focused and more politically activating. In moments of crisis, we must demand that climate change be treated not just as an afterthought, but as the root cause of the disaster. It's time to stop focusing exclusively on short-term relief and rebuilding the status-quo and start building towards a fossil-free, climate-resilient future. So when disaster strikes -- as it will more and more in the coming years, first, make sure you and your loved ones are safe. Second, see if there is anyone in your immediate vicinity who needs your help. And third, join, or plan, a protest that shifts the narrative. Let's make it clear: These are not random catastrophes -- they are the consequences of the fossil-fueled climate emergency. And we can and must hold the culprits accountable.\n",

      "The following commentary was written by a USAID employee, who has requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Working for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) -- the conduit for American soft power across the globe -- demanded I prepare for frightening things that thankfully most Americans don't need to worry about. Defensive driving techniques to escape from a terrorist attack. How to spot where landmines might be in the field. Emergency first aid in the event of a shooting or other attack, including in extremely remote geographies. How to identify possible victims of human trafficking. One thing they never taught us? What to do if you find yourself on the leading edge of a corrupt billionaire's coup in America. Since Jan. 20, President Trump -- or, more accurately, Elon Musk , the religious zealots, and far-right activists behind Project 2025 -- have been enacting a hostile takeover at the heart of the American experiment and dismantling the bureaucratic machinery that is the last bulwark against fascism in the United States. While the focus predictably has been on Trump's never-ending cascade of absurdist claims and the unprecedented overreach of an aborted freeze on all federal spending, USAID has been ground zero for a different set of parasites riding the MAGA wave. Since Trump's slim victory in the 2024 election, these hangers-on have been telegraphing that USAID would be the test site for how to destroy the U.S. government. They're led by Musk, the richest man in the world; Stephen Miller , a White House adviser who architected the Muslim travel ban and child separation policies at the border; and Peter Marocco, who during the first Trump administration bounced around the Departments of Defense, State, Commerce, and USAID before reportedly turning up at the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. It started right out of the gates on Jan. 20, with an executive order freezing all foreign aid that shocked even the most seasoned diplomats. For public purposes, the series of moves now wears the face of freshly minted Secretary of State Marco Rubio , with support from Musk acolytes who are spreading across the government like roaches, including at the already-captured Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Musk's allies and other unelected members of the administration's transition team quickly began and continue to demand lists. Lists of projects and employees working on vaguely defined DEI-related activities. Lists of civil service employees in their vulnerable probationary years. Lists of employees working on statutorily mandated programs that could be targeted for conversion to Trump's beloved Schedule F, a new classification of federal employees created by executive order that strips them of their labor protections. In the first week, an agency-wide gag order barred USAID employees from talking to anyone outside of the Agency, including foreign governments wondering if programs will continue, critical private-sector partners co-funding agency activities, and even other federal agencies. The second week kicked off with the removal of USAID's senior career executive leadership, with nearly 60 civil servants put on administrative leave without cause and with no promise of due process, in what we all quickly started to call the \"Monday Afternoon Massacre.\" They got 30 minutes of notice. Contractors representing more than 25 percent of the Agency's workforce were furloughed or, in the case of many of those working for USAID's Bureaus of Global Health and Humanitarian Assistance, outright fired. This means the White House and Marco Rubio's promises to restore life-saving aid through a waiver system is ultimately an impossible lie: There's no one left to actually deliver the aid. This was followed by the administration's embarrassing and now-infamous \"Fork in the Road\" email, a naked attempt to purge frightened civil servants with the empty promise of a deferred resignation and a pinky swear that they wouldn't just fire us anyway. The email was strikingly similar to one that Musk once sent to Twitter employees, and suggested we \"sign\" the template resignation letter by replying simply with the word \"Resign\" -- to the illegal and reportedly unvetted email server that federal employees allege was connected directly to classified OPM systems by Musk's allies. By the end of week two, the cuts got deeper: Any career civil servants with the word \"gender\" in their job titles or position descriptions were put on administrative leave -- even those championing work started under Ivanka Trump's pet project, the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. USAID's flag and logo were removed from offices in the D.C. area as rumors began swirling of an imminent -- and illegal -- absorption into the Department of State. They even took down the memorial wall at our headquarters honoring the USAID personnel who have died in service to our country. The USAID system for collecting the results of America's investments, the Development Information Solution, was unceremoniously \"terminated.\" On Saturday, Feb. 1, the USAID website and its vast wealth of taxpayer-funded research and reports was taken offline. None of us know if we have jobs to return to today -- a USAID press email address notified all personnel overnight that our headquarters is closed and \"[f]urther guidance will be forthcoming.\" The actual sender was identified as Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) employee Gavin Kliger. Early today, Musk said on X that he was shutting the agency down, with Trump's support . If we try to log in to our computers or enter our offices and are rejected, does that mean we are on administrative leave? Or are we outright fired? Staff have been encouraged to take out professional liability insurance policies given the growing likelihood former USAID contractors with outstanding invoices sue. This is a terrible deal for the government and taxpayers too: Those invoices are all quickly gathering interest thanks to laws that compel agencies to issue payments promptly. In other words, the myriad things Congress funded USAID to do, and which have been done, all just got more expensive for no reason. Federal employees swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. We are not partisan, regardless of our personal political views. We do not -- and should not -- swear oaths of loyalty to President Trump, Shadow President Musk, their enablers, or the feckless legislators who have decided to stand by while the radical Project 2025 obliterates Congress' rightful authority and lines up their constituents for slaughter. USAID is a small agency, representing just 0.7 percent of the federal budget last year, yet for more than 60 years it has been punching above its weight. My colleagues and our predecessors were instrumental to eradicating smallpox, have been at the forefront of treating and preventing the spread of HIV, and shipped millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries. We've revolutionized water, sanitation, energy, and communications infrastructure in more than 80 countries. We've built democratic institutions and ensured free and fair elections on every populated continent. We've been on the ground providing food, clean water, shelter, and hope after every major disaster, disease outbreak, and war since 1961. We've helped teach hundreds of millions of children to read. When we're gone, who will fill the void? ISIS? The cartels? China? When we're gone, where will an emboldened Trump and Musk strike next? The Department of Energy and its engineers stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, the Department of Education and the more than $119 billion it doles out every year to keep public schools afloat, the Environmental Protection Agency and its clean air and water regulations that have saved millions of American lives? And given the value Musk is providing to foreign powers -- including countries like China, where he has vast fortunes on the line -- will anyone capable of assessing the damage and self-enrichment currently unfolding in real time even be left? USAID is the guinea pig. After us, there will be more. Many more. And then, eventually, there will be none. Elon Musk and the DOGE, a made-up meme of an organization with no congressional mandate to exist, has started to replace more than 2 million experienced experts who have dedicated their careers to helping everyday Americans with untrained, inefficient, and incompetent tech bros. And in those same two weeks, they have also managed to force their way into the government's most sensitive and highly classified systems -- the dangers of which may take decades to realize. The richest man in the world and his allies have used his influence with the president of the United States to seize control of government procurement data (including intellectual property of many of his competitors); gain access to the names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and performance records of millions of Americans that he specifically denounces -- including USAID employees Musk describes as being part of a \" criminal organization \"; and, with this cabal's parallel efforts at Treasury , grab the reins of the very mechanisms that deliver every cent of the trillions the government spends, including on Social Security, Medicare, and SNAP payments. Musk is treating the U.S. government like another company that he can bring to its knees while stealing its best ideas and lining his already comically overflowing pockets -- but this time, it's with taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. President Trump's loose leash on Musk, meanwhile, is demonstrating that he is willing to sit in the Oval Office while smarter men use his banner and power to drive this country to ruin. When will congressional leaders stop cowering in fear of billionaire overlords and remember their dereliction of duty leaves over 330 million people more vulnerable by the day? USAID makes America stronger, safer, and more prosperous, and we make the world a better place. No matter what they say about us or how they treat us, we will always be among the best this country has to offer, and it will always be the greatest honor of my life to serve the American people.\n"

      "Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, her new VP pick, have gotten a lot of mileage out of labeling Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance \"weird.\" It's a brilliant construction, as it's taken the word hurled at those considered outsiders in America -- by race, gender, or affinity -- and attached it firmly to white men of the right-wing persuasion. It's also a primo move of someone who is a member of my generation, Generation X -- taking back the power of the outsider and exposing those who claim normalcy as the freaks they really are. If elected, Kamala Harris would be the first arguably Generation X president and fittingly laced with both ambivalence and cool. Technically she is the very latest Boomer -- born at the tail end of 1964, a month away from being officially Gen X. But Harris is Gen X in her personal style and in the ways in which she is read -- and misread -- by her naysayers. Embracing her Gen X self is her best bet for connecting with a wide range of voters, especially young ones. How so? As a Gen Xer, I speak from a position of ironized insight. The memes that her critics use for ridicule are actually quite appealing to my generation, born between 1965 and 1979. Gen X's ironic yet passionate relationship to sub-cultural and cultish pop culture -- the Internet before the Internet, as it were -- is part of what has been so appealing to younger voters who are now taken with her \"coconut tree\" meme, call her \"brat,\" riff on her visit to a record store to get vinyl (and dig the fact that she likes vinyl), and love her TikTok with NSYNC's Lance Bass. While Harris has been accused of being fake , not relatable and even falsely a uthentic -- the Right trolled her for her raucous laughter, her youthful romances, and her unusual phrases ( \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\" among others) -- her success so far proves them wrong. While the critics are clearly motivated by a desire to discredit her candidacy (and resorting to racism and sexism in the process) they are also channeling what we might call \"negative generationalism.\" Harris radiates certain kinds of Gen X adjacent realness. See: her dancing unselfconsciously or discussing how to cook a turkey in great buttery detail. While politicians have been trying to show they're \"real people\" for hundreds of years, Harris' attempts at realness appear more \"real\" in that, say, she's actually dancing because she seems as if she really wants to dance, rather than simply thinking, \"I should dance!\" It's not for nothing that videos of her doing these things have gone crazy viral. While her critics have mocked her relentlessly for seeming strained, in truth she only seems artificial when she is trying to be a typical politician. When she does try to sound conventional and stentorian, she is clearly inhabiting a persona. She doesn't, in other words, become that persona (the latter is a Boomer habit, see: Clinton, Bill) but tries it on for ill-fitting size, very obviously. Let's take her awkwardness at playing this role -- and her ease with authentically dancing or cooking -- as points in her favor rather than against her. And Harris' generational identity -- political disaffection is an X hallmark -- vibes with today's alienated electorate. As Michael Sandel recently noted, 85 percent of Americans believe they lack a real say in defining the political powers that shape their lives and also don't believe politicians care what they think. In addition, a large group of Americans -- 40 percent -- sometimes or often avoid the news, as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism has found. As the historian Kim Phillips-Fein has noted, Gen X, too, is known \"for an antagonism toward the political establishment and a deflation of pretension of all sorts.\" We came of age in an era in which we expected the world to not work properly. Having grown up around or after Watergate, we missed the 1960s sense of possibility, living in the curdled aftermath of failed attempts at radical living, with widespread divorce -- or parents who should have been divorced. We had a sense that we were unlikely to change anything if we tried. Again, recalling this older context and emphasizing the parallels between then and now is useful, when we are dealing with voters disconnected from presidential politics. There is a playbook for this. For years, the right has capitalized on this anomie by supporting MAGA Gen X politicians like Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, lashing out in anger. I think of them as \"Bad Gen X\", produced by not only Trump and the alt-right but also the Reagan 1980s and the atmosphere of political animus that swirled then and in the 1990s. Democrats have failed to produce a particularly successful Gen X politician -- but the time has come. Harris also exhibits that Gen X postmodern \"both-and\" relationship to her identity -- both childless and a \"Momala\" to her step-kids; both Black and Asian-American; both a prosecutor and a liberal. She represents that latest installment in the promise of early identity politics and of the increased opportunity and interest in hybridity that really took off in the 1990s. In postcolonial thought back then, hybridity was starting to be used to describe this mixture of transcultural elements to achieve greater power. So far, I've checked off Harris' understanding of Gen X/Gen Z anomie, her off-kilter authenticity and even her hybrid identity as strong selling points. There are, however, also more meat-and-potatoes Gen X markers that could help make the case for her candidacy to a younger electorate, if she were to lean into them. Harris could, for instance, deploy a first-hand experience of economic difficulties after graduating from college or grad school that so many of my generation had. In the three years after Kamala graduated law school in 1989, unemployment rose to a high of 12 percent, not to fully recover for 7 years. I discovered this personally in my twenties, when I worked numerous gig jobs, in bookstores, fact checking, personal assisting, throughout the early 1990s, as I, like so many others, could not find consistent employment. Recalling those times could chime with a generation that is now often unable to, say, buy their homes. In a related point, Harris's focus on the foreclosure debacle when she became attorney general of California, getting money for homeowners who had been harmed by the mortgage collapse, could chime with these voters. Similarly, Harris's discourse about reproductive rights, which has been dubbed \"unapologetic,\" reflects both Gen X and Gen Z. Gen X, after all, was a generation of women that volunteered at clinics as escorts while at the same time experiencing the first and second waves of anti-abortion terrorism from the Right to Life movement. There are parallels to today's Gen Z-ers, who fear, correctly, that their rights to their bodily autonomy may be ending. \"Generation X,\" more than thirty years after the author Douglas Coupland first coined the phrase, still means something. Democrats -- and Harris herself -- should embrace the association, along with her period-specific dance moves, Converse sneakers, and surreal locutions. As two icons of Gen X might say -- RuPaul and Mary J. Blige -- she needs to \"work that.\" This story was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .

      "Donald Trump got away with it. That's the result, anyway. Monday's Supreme Court decision is a little more detailed: The court, by a 6-3 vote along partisan lines, granted the once-and-maybe-future president immunity from prosecution over most of his actions to overthrow the government in 2020 and 2021. But that's the end result: Donald Trump may never face accountability for his actions to overturn the 2020 election. And it comes in the context of other Stay-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards he's been handed, like District Judge Aileen Cannon's inexplicable delays of his \"Classified Files in the Bathroom\" case, and the delays in the Georgia election interference case against him. None of these will be resolved before November, when, at present, a majority of American voters say they'll vote for him to be president again, believing he can tackle inflation . Only the Stormy Daniels case will have been decided in time. What's remarkable about the Supreme Court 's decision is how novel it is. Conservative justices are supposed to dislike decisions with \"no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.\" That's what the Dobbs opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, said about Roe v. Wade . But it's equally true of Monday's decision in Trump v. U.S . There is no constitutional, statutory, or other basis for declaring presidents immune from criminal prosecution. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion recognizes as much. But, he says, \"criminally prosecuting a President for official conduct undoubtedly poses a ... threat of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\" And that violates the constitutional separation of powers. Presto! Presidents are now immune from criminal prosecution, as long as the acts in question are \"official acts.\" President Bill Clinton can still get sued for lying about his affair with Paula Jones, but Donald Trump cannot get sued for trying to steal an election. The court did leave the door open a crack in terms of the specific charges against Trump. Some of Trump's actions, it said, were partly official and partly not. So, Roberts instructed the trial court to review items such as Trump's pressuring state officials to annul election results, creating fraudulent sets of alternative electors, cajoling Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the election on January 6 (which he had no authority to do), and, of course, inciting an angry mob that violently attacked the Capitol on January 6. For each of those charges, the district court is supposed to determine whether prosecuting Trump for that conduct \"would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\" If so, he's immune. If not, not. But of course that crack won't matter much if Trump wins the election, because this is ultimately a federal case brought by the Department of Justice, and he can call it off next January 20. Presto again. Now, despite this doctrine of presidential immunity being completely new and made up out of nothing, there are some good reasons for it. As the court's opinion points out, we don't want to become some banana republic where each president prosecutes the preceding one out of spite, right? Then again, as Justice Sotomayor's fiery dissent points out, that's why we have, you know, laws and stuff. As the House Republican impeachment managers have recently discovered, you can't just press charges against someone because you hate them. They need to have actually allegedly done something criminal that you can indict them for doing. Which is one reason there's almost no precedent for a case like this: Because there has never before been a president like Donald Trump. (Richard Nixon, who doesn't really come close, was pardoned.) On the flip side, what's more \"banana republic\" than allowing a president to do whatever he wants, free from consequences, as long as it's within his \"official capacity\" to do so? Here's Sotomayor again: \"When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy's Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\" As colorful as these examples are, arguably they're too tame. Trump is a former president who, when he lost an election, tried to steal it. The only form of accountability the court leaves in place -- the will of the voters -- is exactly what was attacked by Donald Trump's schemes and plots. And Trump is now a candidate promising to use the Department of Justice to go after his enemies; the Supreme Court has now given him carte blanche to do so This is what people mean when they use words like \"fascism\" and \"dictatorship\": unjustly utilizing the levers of state power to consolidate them behind the bold, charismatic leader. These aren't \"official acts\" for which a subsequent president might seek revenge. They are craven, illegal acts in the cloak of official power. They are the essence of authoritarianism. These aren't the fever dreams of a liberal Rolling Stone columnist. Project 2025 , the 900+-page blueprint for the next Trump presidency, lays out in exquisite detail the Christian Nationalist Right's plan to dismantle the administrative state and install partisan lackeys at all levels of government. And the court is helping. Last week, in a little-covered decision that was earth-shattering in its impact, the court overturned the forty-year-old \" Chevron doctrine \" that required courts to defer to agency interpretations of laws. And on Monday, the court similarly opened up longstanding federal regulations to new legal challenges. Bit by bit, our country's guardrails against authoritarianism are being dismantled. Unlike some of my peers in the press, however, I want to suggest that Monday's opinion may not matter much in terms of the 2024 election. First of all, the court had already delayed issuing this opinion for five months; while it rushed out its opinion ruling that Trump couldn't be kept off state ballots for inciting an insurrection, it refused to expedite this case and left the decision for the final day of the term. Even had they ruled against Trump, it's hard to imagine a conviction would have come before November. Second, as we saw with the Stormy Daniels case, verdicts don't necessarily matter much to voters. Sure, getting convicted for insurrection is more serious than getting convicted for falsifying business records to pay off an adult film actress. But would a guilty verdict really have moved the needle that much anyway? Voters are focused on the economy; many, especially younger ones, see that the system is rigged, and see Trump as a chaotic figure who might just shake it up -- even though Trump's policies rewarded the 1 percent to a greater extent than any previous president's. Many older voters have, putting it gently, traditionalist views about American society. If they haven't paid attention to Jan. 6 yet, I'm not sure a court case would've changed that. And remember, this is how fascism often takes root. The Nazis won their 35 percent plurality on the basis of economic and social discontent; nationalists in France and Italy have capitalized both on fear of immigration and on economic woes. We are not any different. In the larger context of this moment of American history, however, the Supreme Court has once again failed -- perhaps intentionally -- to recognize the gravity of this moment, the seriousness of Trump's attempts to overthrow the government in 2021, and the threat he presents now . At least two justices, of course, appear to support his authoritarian designs (or at least don't mind if their wives do). But all six of the court's conservatives seem to regard his actions as mere misconduct, or \"official acts\" like pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey. In so doing, they have perhaps willfully lost the plot. If the Supreme Court is meant to be a check against governmental tyranny, a protector of the vulnerable against the strong, and a defender of the democratic order, it has utterly failed us.\n"

      "My generation has grown up during one of the most complex and unprecedented times in American history. We've witnessed war, genocide, historic climate disasters, a raging gun violence epidemic, an insurrection, an economy that doesn't work for us, and the lowest levels of trust in government -- paired with an ever-deepening hyper-partisanship. And the list goes on. We are the mass shooting generation, the generation that will bear the brunt of climate change, and the generation inheriting crises that threaten our future. We grew up with active shooter drills in our schools, watched our planet's ecosystems change before our eyes, and now face mounting student debt, an unaffordable housing market, and an uncertain economic landscape that feels rigged against us. It's no secret that there's a lot being said right now about the recent election. People are pointing fingers, making generalizations, and casting blame, some of it unfairly directed at young people. Pundits are doing what they do best. I suppose we all still need to pay the bills. But what often gets lost in the noise of this political finger-pointing is the relentless work and activism that young people have done -- and continue to do -- to build a better future. Too often overlooked is our unwavering resilience -- our ability to drive change in the face of the harshest challenges and the deepest adversity. Young people have been forged by trauma and conflict, raised in a world that tells us we don't deserve the rights our grandparents had, that we don't deserve safety, and that we don't deserve a seat at the table to determine our own future. We've been harassed , targeted , locked out , kicked when we're down, and blamed when we're not doing enough. We're exhausted. And we have every right to be. And yet, despite all this, we've found ways to resist, adapt, and advocate for a better world. Election after election, we've faced adversity and disappointment, yet we've continued to push forward, building our own communities and forging our own political power. Whether organizing the largest march since the Vietnam War, empowering hundreds of thousands to rally with us in cities around the world, walking out of our classrooms and into the streets to demand change, protesting and passing laws in statehouses across the country, or lobbying Congress to pass life-saving and historic legislation, we have fought tirelessly. In this election cycle, we once again gave it our all -- traveling across the country to get out the vote, talking to millions of voters, demanding change from our leaders, and ensuring our voices shaped the national conversation. To the students studying while juggling jobs to pay rent and loans, to the Dreamers who only ask for the chance to call this country their home, to the older siblings helping their families, to those trying to start a family or find stable work, and to every young person, everywhere, I say this: Be proud of yourself. Amid all of this, you still found time to make your voice heard and fought for your life and for the future of your peers. You've carried the weight of this work while politicians, whose sole responsibility is to fight for us, neglected their jobs and threatened our lives for their own ambitions. I wish I could tell you that the fight is over, that we could put away our clipboards and step away from the frontlines. That we could simply be kids, students, and whatever we want to be, free from the burden of these battles. But we know the reality. We know this isn't a luxury we can afford. Our lives are still on the line, and it's our job to march for them -- for our future, for our children's future, and the future of the generations to come. We must fight for the ideals America was founded on, for the promise of the American Dream, and for our place in shaping that dream. And that is worth fighting for. A future where we can go to the movies or school without fear of being shot. Where we can live without the constant threat of climate disaster. Where we can afford a home and invest in our future -- and in our children's future. A future where we can love who we love, start a family, and be who we truly are. A future with leaders who care about our jobs, our pay, our rights, and our lives -- not the stock market, lobbyists, big corporations, or their own careers. And a future where our politics are free of vitriol, corruption, and violence, a future defined by decency and compassion, where the only arguments on Thanksgiving are over who gets to sit next to Grandma or who ate the last bit of mashed potatoes. The task ahead is tall, the fight is difficult, but together, we can -- and we will -- make this future a reality. We will shape our future into what we want it to be. Our resilience is our strength, and our pride lies in our determination to build the future we deserve -- a future where safety, economic opportunity, and dignity are rights, not privileges. This is the legacy we're fighting to create, and it's one we'll continue to build, no matter the obstacles in our way. And remember, you're not alone, organizations like March For Our Lives , Sunrise Movement, United We Dream Action, Gen-Z for Change, and others are here to hear you, fight for you, and march alongside you. Ryan Barto is an activist, a CWA Local 1101 union member, and a former employee at March For Our Lives.\n",

      "Just over eight years ago, Donald Trump announced Mike Pence as his running mate. The choice was seen as an olive branch to the insiders of the Republican Party who appreciated Pence as a classical conservative with rock solid right-wing policy views. Pence also represented a salvo for white evangelicals still unsure of voting for Trump. \"'I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican -- in that order,\" Pence proclaimed in his acceptance speech. As Richard Land, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, told The Atlantic , \"Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician. I don't know anyone who's more consistent in bringing his evangelical Christian worldview to public policy.\" Critics railed against Pence's record on abortion rights, his opposition to gay marriage, and his response to an AIDS crisis in Indiana while he was governor. Yet, regardless of who you asked, one thing was clear: Mike Pence was a Christian conservative chosen to represent white evangelicals and their allies in the White House. Just over a week ago, Trump announced J.D. Vance as his running mate for the 2024 election. Vance, a first-term senator from Ohio, has been largely seen as a choice bolstering Trump's outsider image -- a young Midwestern firebrand who would bring Silicon Valley money and youthful energy to the ticket. What has gone largely unnoticed is that Vance is a more radical religious politician than Pence, even though the latter was hailed as the \"Christian\" candidate. Though Vance's Catholicism has barely registered as a driving factor in his political profile, it serves as an interpretive key for understanding why Vance was chosen and how he brings a populist radicalism to a potential second Trump presidency. In 2019, Vance was received into the Catholic Church. He grew up with exposure to Christian churches, but by the time he entered law school described himself as an angry atheist. However, on Vances' telling , Catholicism began to appeal to him because of its intellectual approach to faith and human life. He was also influenced by his first encounter with PayPal founder and leader of the Silicon Valley Reactionary Right , Peter Thiel, who convinced him that social ladder-climbing and endless pursuits of wealth were empty in comparison to living a life of significance and meaning. Soon after he converted, Vance ran for Senate in Ohio. In 2021, the newly converted candidate spoke to the Napa Institute , a network of conservative Catholics who are known for defying the Pope, largely opposed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, and backed by billionaire donors who are sympathetic to a Christian nationalist vision. In his speech, Vance griped that \"the business community is actively pro-abortion in this country.\" His solution would be to take active measures against businesses that use their First Amendment rights to express pro-choice positions. \"If our answer is to continue to give more power to the business community that's combating our values, what we're doing is sacrificing the life of the unborn and our future on the altar of these companies.\" As Rick Pidcock points out , the Napa Institute is such an extremist organization that a petition was launched calling on the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to end its affiliation with the group in part because event agendas included a prayer invoking divine \"continuance on our cause and our people,\" using the words of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and \"questioning the authenticity of the Civil Rights movement.\" In the same year, Vance also appeared at a signature meeting for Teneo , an organization started by Evan Baehr -- another Thiel acolyte -- and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). Talking about the Texas abortion bounty law, Vance complained that \"virtually every major big corporation in this country felt the need to issue a statement in support of not the unborn babies, but in support of people who might want to abort them.\" Then he said: \"If we're unwilling to make companies that are taking the side of the left in the culture wars feel real economic pain, then we're not serious about winning the culture war.\" Baehr, Hawley, and Thiel envision Teneo as a Federalist Society for venture capitalists . Vance is reportedly a member. The organization was fledgling until Leonard Leo stepped in to raise funds. Leo, who according to 2022 filings has served on the board of the NAapa Institute Legal Foundation and the Napa Institute Legal Foundation, is the infamous leader of the actual Federalist Society, who shepherded Trump's three Supreme Court nominees to the bench, stepped in a few years ago. Now Teneo is funded by money from Leo's dark money networks, the Charles Koch Foundation, the DeVos family and other big donors. The group is Leo's new conduit for imposing his conservative Catholic agenda on American culture and institutions. During this time, Vance also became close to the Catholic postliberal philosopher Patrick Deneen, who appeared with Vance and Heritage Foundation leader Kevin Roberts (also a reactionary Catholic) in May 2023 to launch Deneen's book, Regime Change . At the event, Deneen called for something more radical than January 6th: a complete toppling of the current American order. \"I don't want to violently overthrow the government,\" he said. \"I want something far more revolutionary.\" Deneen proposes an \"aristopopulism,\" in which the virtuous elite provide order and structure to public life in order to ensure the flourishing of the ordinary citizens who cannot provide it for themselves. The benevolent oligarchs are thus tasked with keeping the common good intact so that hoi polloi can enjoy the good life -- even if they don't know or believe or experience it as such. Deneen's \"common good conservatism\" is a move away from Ronald Reagan's conservative fusionism -- which combines the conservative Christian foundations of family, faith, and military strength with the libertarian idea that government is not the answer, but the problem -- toward an imposition of a certain vision of the common good on all Americans through government. But Deneens' view of the common good doesn't include everyone. He opposes gay marriage, wants stricter laws on divorce, denounces CRT, and mocks health care for trans people as absurd. Deneen lauds authoritarian Viktor Orban's Hungary as a place where the state actively cultivates political and moral order. \"The role of the government,\" writes political scientist Chelsea Ebin about Deneen and other postliberal Catholics, \"is not to preserve individual rights and manage competing interpretations of the good but to impose and enforce a singular conception of the good through the regulation of social relations.\" Vance has signaled his sympathies with Deneen's approach many times -- appearing with him publicly and citing his influence. Deneen put out a statement when Vance was announced as Trump's running mate: \"J.D. combines a dedication to domestic productivity, foreign policy realism, and a deep commitment to strengthening American families and the communities that sustain them. He is a man of deep personal faith and integrity, a devoted family man, a generous friend, and a genuine patriot.\" Laura K. Field, Senior Fellow at the Niskanen Center , told me in an email that intellectually Vance \"is closest to postliberals and Catholics like Patrick Deneen, Adrian Vermeule, Gladden Pappin, and Sohrab Ahmari. They want to legislate morality (as they conceive of it), and the postliberals generally use the language of 'the common good' to capture this moral objective.\" Vance also has a strong bond with Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation and a fellow reactionary Catholic with close ties to Opus Dei . The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 by Paul Weyrich, architect of the Religious Right, a \"radical right-wing movement,\" and a Catholic who rejected the Second Vatican Council. Weyrich's mission was to revolutionize American politics through what Ebin labels \"the insertion of Catholic morality into American politics.\" As current head of the Heritage Foundation, Roberts is extending Weyrich's legacy. He said in a recent interview that there would be a second \"American revolution that would remain bloodless if the Left allowed it.\" Project 2025, published by the Heritage Foundation, is a handbook for the next Trump presidency -- and a guidebook for the founding of a new America. It is in essence, Project 2025 is a 922-page blueprint for an American regime change by way of an unchecked executive branch -- what one might see as a practical application of the type of common good conservatism articulated philosophically by Deneen. When Vance was announced as Trump's running mate, Roberts said : \"He understands the moment we are in this country, which is that we have a limited amount of time to implement great policy on behalf of forgotten Americans, someone J.D. Vance personifies. At Heritage, we could not be happier.\" The admiration goes both ways. Vance wrote the foreword to Roberts' forthcoming book, Dawn's Early Light . The influences of Thiel, Leo, and Deneen on Vance's approaches to government and policy are clear. Vance's 2019 speech at Natcon appeared in print in First Things , the flagship publication of reactionary Catholic thought. It's titled \"Beyond Libertarianism,\" and is a reflection on the ways that the government should play a role in shaping American social and cultural life: We live in an environment that's shaped by our laws and public policy, and we cannot hide from that fact anymore. I think the question conservatives confront at this key moment is this: Whom do we serve? Do we serve pure, unfettered commercial freedom? Do we serve commerce at the expense of the public good? Or do we serve something higher? And are we willing to use political power to actually accomplish those things? In another era, a conservative viewing government as the answer to human problems would have been unthinkable. But for Vance, the solution to what he sees as the decline of the American dream is more government shaping the country actively in service of a higher power. The common good, in other words, needs to be lawfully implemented upon the nation for it to be ordered rightly. Following Deneen, Vance sees the government's role not as progress toward a society where humans can exercise their rights freely, but where humans are structured by their government in order to live in accordance with God's divine order. In 2022, Vance spoke at a conference at Franciscan University with the intellectual luminaries of common good conservatism. On one panel , theologian Chad Pecknold argued that the way toward civic happiness \"is a public orientation to God\" through the restoration of Sabbath laws, religious national holidays, and public liturgies. Vance seems to resonate with such sentiments, even if his rhetoric is more politically measured. \"We have to recognize that America is not just a principle. It is a group of people. It's a history. It's a culture. And yeah, part of that story is that people can come and assimilate,\" Vance said in a 2024 interview at First Things . \"But if your attitude is that . . . the only thing you need to become an American is to believe that with a little bit of hormonal therapy a man can become a woman, then you're making it so that massive numbers of your own country either need to be re-educated, or need to be cast out of the political community.\" As the Catholic theologian Massimo Faggioli puts it, \"For Vance, Christianity and the church are not the problem but the solution to the ills of the political-religious project called the United States of America.\" One of the reasons Vance was chosen to be Trump's running mate is that since entering the Senate in 2022 he has become a reliable MAGA spokesperson. Vance is often better than Trump himself at outlining policies related to Ukraine, trade and tariffs, and reproductive rights. He also seems to be up to the task that Mike Pence wasn't -- not certifying the election results if necessary . But he is not simply an instrument for achieving Trump's MAGA coronation. He's the vanguard of a new religious populism Roberts, Deneen, Leo, and others believe will right the nation. \"We are in a late republican period,\" Vance said to the journalist James Pogue . In doing so, Pogue observes, he \"evoked the common New Right view of America as Rome awaiting its Caesar. Vance continued: \"If we're going to push back against it, we're going to have to get pretty wild, and pretty far out there, and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.\" On a 2021 appearance on the Jack Murphy podcast , Vance reiterated a position from the reactionary monarchist Curtis Yarvin to fire government employees. \"I think Trump is going to run again in 2024,\" said Vance. \"I think that what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single mid level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people. And when the courts stop you, stand before the country, and say . . . the chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.\" Yarvin is a self-proclaimed monarchist; the house philosopher of Thiel's entourage; and someone who has remarked that the end of democracy would be joyous. He wants an American king to rule a post-constitutional America. Following the blueprint of Silicon Valley monarchists like Yarvin, Project 2025 architects like Roberts, and D.C. chaos agents like Steve Bannon, Vance favors a unified executive branch that has incredible power over the federal government. In essence, he envisions a chief executive with the power to make sweeping changes to American life through government policy, executive orders, and institutional reform. \"I think the basic idea is that we have to seize the institutions and make them actually work for our people,\" he said in a 2023 interview. In this sense, Vance is not a complement to Trump's MAGA agenda. He is the bridge to something more radical -- a religious populism intent on bending the United States into a narrow reactionary Catholic, and perhaps monarchical, order. \"Trump will, at most, serve four years in the White House,\" Vance told Ian Ward in March of 2024. \"There is a big question about what comes after him.\" If Trump was crowned the MAGA messiah at the 2024 Republican convention, then it seems Vance is the apostle who will bring forth a conservative vision more extreme than even the MAGA Chosen One imagines. \"You know, Jesus played the small rooms until St. Paul came around,\" Bannon told Ward. \"It took the zeal of St. Paul to turn Jesus into a headliner.\" And Mike Pence, the embodiment of Christian conservatism and Reaganite dreams, can do nothing more than watch from home. When the January 6th mob erected gallows for the then-vice president, they didn't succeed in hanging him. But it does seem that on that day one brand of American conservatism -- fusionism -- was finally put to rest and a violent religious populism took the throne. This is not a crusade for a Christian nation. It's a march toward American Christendom. Vance is the political symbol of that movement -- even if there are growing doubts about whether he was the right pick . For now he's running to be vice president. Someday, he (or someone like him) may try to be king. God, save us all.\n"

      "People often ask me why I do what I do. Why go undercover to expose extremist Republicans like Senator Ron Johnson , Trump coup attorney John Eastman , or Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ? Can't you just ask them for an interview? To give you a fuller context for my motivation requires first going back to the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 in lower Manhattan. Running late for class, I bounded up the stairs at the City Hall subway station, and was greeted by a construction boom that was not normal. As I made my way west on Chambers Street, I soon discovered its source. A plane had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. \"Oh my God! What a terrible accident!\" \"Pilots can't fly anywhere close enough for that to be an accident.\" The scene was surreal, to be sure, but I kept on task. I made it to the street entrance of campus before turning to stare back at the towers in astonishment. The second plane suddenly came into view before exploding into the South Tower, and in slow motion I reeled backward. There was no more speculation: We were under attack. There was also no cell service, nor transportation. People fled from downtown on foot, desperate to escape, but many of us stayed to bear witness to horrors we could not yet fathom. A woman screamed, \"Oh my God! They're falling out of the building!\" We watched a man drop, tie flapping in the wind. Then another. And another. A retired firefighter spoke up, \"They're not falling. They're jumping. Look at the spacing -- it's organized.\" At 20-years-old, this was devastating. It's more than 20 years later, and I'm crying as I type this. Strangers became friends, trauma bonding as we watched the towers collapse, and ran from clouds of smoke and debris together. We crowded into bars with televisions tuned to the news; learned of the other attacks; and drank to dull the sensation of this newfound hellscape. Behind a covered fence encircling Ground Zero, the metal crater smoldered for months, emanating a stench of death. Burning plastic, burning chemicals, burning bodies haunt those of us who witnessed 9/11 on the ground that day and in the many days and weeks thereafter. The obligation to bear witness to history planted the seed for what would become my political reporting career. Fast forward to the fall of 2020. Joe Biden had clearly won the election, but Donald Trump was contesting the vote in battleground states across the country. When I learned that there would be historic Senate runoffs in Georgia and that the state was under attack by MAGA extremists, I decided to spend several weeks there reporting. In early December, I talked to Rudy Giuliani at the state capitol, outside of an election commission hearing where he was arguing that massive voter fraud had occurred. Although I certainly tried to provoke him, it wasn't like he was going to openly admit on a visible camera to committing crimes. In order to have a better chance of eliciting incriminating evidence from the election deniers, I decided to go undercover as one of them. That's how I got my first big scoop: that there would be a Senate objection to the Electoral College count to certify the 2020 election results. This was a big deal because the Beltway conventional wisdom was that the challenge was a fringe idea that would stay in the conservative House Freedom Caucus and go nowhere. But both then-Senator-elect Tommy Tuberville and then-Senator David Perdue confirmed to me that they planned to back the election-denial effort. The story went nuclear when Trump thanked me via tweet , calling Perdue a patriot. This led to Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz launching their own objections to the Electoral College count. Everywhere I went in Georgia, Republican politicians were telling voters to keep fighting for Trump. It seemed pretty clear to me that something big was brewing. Much to the surprise of Beltway insiders, the Georgia Senate runoffs ended with two Democratic victories on Jan. 5, 2021. I was supposed to return to Washington, but I decided to relax instead. No more hustling for stories. No driving. I flipped on the TV to watch the news. There was smoke billowing from the U.S. Capitol, where insurrectionists were attempting to block the transfer of power. The scene was horrifying and surreal, but all too familiar. When I returned, fences had been erected around Capitol Hill, and would remain there for months. It was another Ground Zero, but this time, the work of an enemy within, to borrow a phrase from Trump . Had I been in D.C. that day, I know in my bones that I would have been filming the traitors attempting a coup. Though they failed, I could see that they were not finished. And so I set out on a crazy, gonzo mission to capture evidence of what the insurrectionists had done, and what they were planning to do in the elections to come. In my best Southern drawl, I told MAGA Republicans that I had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and asked why they didn't do more to fight for President Trump. Ted Cruz told me he \"led the fight\" in the Senate. John Eastman, the lead architect of Trump's fake elector plot, said there was \"no question\" his legal rationale was totally solid. Some answered contrary to my expectations. Vice President Mike Pence said we do not want federal bureaucrats deciding our elections. Sen. Ron Johnson explained how Trump legitimately lost Wisconsin. As the years progressed, the election-denial movement did not wane, but intensified, and efforts to hold Trump and his co-conspirators accountable were stalling out in case after case. I broke stories about Trump coup attorney Cleta Mitchell and her plans to suppress the vote and install rabid election deniers as poll workers in battleground states. The Supreme Court appeared to be helping push Trump's criminal trials until after the election -- and remained shrouded in secrecy, despite damning reporting by ProPublica revealing massive corruption among its conservative members. So I went undercover at the Supreme Court Historical Society's annual dinners to see if I could get any clues from the justices. Alito's colorful wife, Martha-Ann, went on an extended rant about suing media companies for defamation and her desire to design protest flags against gay people. A design she was particularly proud of involved the Italian word for shame -- \"vergogna\" -- emblazoned in flames. She alluded multiple times to her husband's impending retirement (something he would likely only consider under a second Trump presidency). But my biggest scoop yet was delivered by Alito himself, as he admitted to a lack of impartiality, a bedrock principle of American jurisprudence, and asserted that America's polarization can only be solved one way : \"One side or the other is going to win.\" My detractors question my tactics, but my undercover reporting over the last four years has been in service of a greater public good: preserving our democracy in the face of very real and very imminent threats. Longtime Trump ally and self proclaimed \"dirty trickster\" Roger Stone , who claims to be a born-again Christian, is fond of telling the MAGA faithful: \"This is nothing less than an epic struggle between dark and light. This is a struggle between good and evil. This is a struggle between the godly and the godless, and if America loses this struggle, my friends, this country will step off into a thousand years of darkness.\" Right-wing extremists believe that they are at war with the Left, increasingly in these apocalyptic terms -- and if they succeed, they will upend the great American tradition of the separation of church and state, and lead us down the path toward Christian theocracy. I went undercover with Stone on multiple occasions and he admitted to working on a plan to re-elect Trump that relies on judges and courts to contest and suppress the vote. My first feature length documentary, Gonzo for Democracy -- available online today! -- is the culmination of my quest for truth from, and accountability for, our elected leaders. Gonzo connects the dots of all my reporting; features commentary from several members of Congress, celebrities, and media personalities -- from Congressman Jamie Raskin, to Kathy Griffin, to George Conway; and attempts to answer the question of how we as a country got to the Jan. 6 insurrection in the first place. How do we make sure it never happens again? I went gonzo to expose truths that all Americans deserve to know. What you do with them now is up to you.\n"

      "In 2000, I was stationed in Florida and away from my home state of New Jersey. I sent in my mail-in ballot and voted for Al Gore, believing I was participating in a cornerstone of democracy. However, as the recount chaos unfolded -- with hanging chads, legal battles, and a controversial Supreme Court decision -- I was left wondering if my vote had even been counted. I deployed soon after, following 9/11, pushing those concerns aside. But the lessons from that election never left me. Voting rights , especially for minority blocs, are fragile and must be fiercely protected. Now, 24 years later, we are witnessing another attempt to undermine mail-in voting. Pennsylvania Republicans recently tried to impose stricter ID requirements on military and overseas voters, a move that threatened to throw thousands of ballots into jeopardy just days before the general election. Their lawsuit sought to change rules that exempt military voters from state voter ID laws -- an exemption in place since 2012 to ensure that deployed troops can vote without facing undue barriers. Thankfully, a federal judge rejected the lawsuit, citing its proximity to Election Day as well as its baselessness. But the attempt itself is alarming. It's part of a broader strategy by Donald Trump and his allies to sow doubt in the electoral process. The timing of this lawsuit -- filed just as over 25,000 mail-in ballots were sent out to military voters in Pennsylvania -- was reckless. The six Pennsylvania GOP congressmen behind it, all of whom refused to certify the 2020 election, claimed that the state's exemption from voter ID rules for military personnel invites fraud. The lawmakers' effort was backed by the America First Legal Foundation, the nonprofit led by former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller, which claimed that, under current law, \"bad actors, both foreign and domestic\" could \"seek to benefit from the successful registration of fraudulent voters to cast illegal ballots.\" The judge, however, dismissed Republicans' claims as \"phantom fears of foreign malfeasance,\" criticizing the GOP's last-minute attempt to change rules that have been in place for over a decade. But this isn't just about one lawsuit or one state; it's part of a broader, more dangerous agenda. On Wednesday, Trump claimed , without evidence, that \"Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,\" adding: \"Law Enforcement must act, NOW!\" This is a familiar tactic. Trump used similar claims to justify his refusal to accept the 2020 election results, including in Pennsylvania, which culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A majority of GOP House lawmakers voted to overturn Pennsylvania's election results, objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory there. Most of the congressmen in Keystone State's Republican House delegation joined the effort, including all six who were part of the military voter ID lawsuit. Now, as we approach the 2024 election , Trump and his allies are once again setting the stage to try to discredit the results, particularly if he loses. The stakes couldn't be higher. If Trump and his supporters can create enough confusion and doubt around the mail-in voting process -- especially for military voters -- it could lead to another constitutional crisis on Jan. 6, 2025, with the potential for even more violence. Trump's control of the Georgia State Elections Board will further sow chaos, as those appointees have rewritten state rules to try to give county election officials the authority to arbitrarily refuse to certify election results. And as Rolling Stone reported Tuesday, there are dozens of pro-Trump election deniers serving as election officials in Pennsylvania. The broader Republican strategy here is clear: By undermining the votes of military personnel, elderly veterans, minority groups, and others who rely on mail-in voting, they are laying the groundwork for claims of a \"stolen\" election. This isn't just undemocratic -- it's dangerous. The potential for another Jan. 6-style crisis should serve as a wake-up call to every American who values free and fair elections. My experience as a potentially disenfranchised military voter in 2000 is a painful reminder of how fragile our democracy can be when voting rights are contested. We cannot allow history to repeat itself. The attempted disenfranchisement of any American military member is a betrayal not only of the troops but democracy itself. There will no doubt be attempts by Trump and his allies to throw out votes cast overseas by military members and others. It is unmitigated hypocrisy for Republicans to claim they support the military while actively trying to suppress their votes. This is a fight we must take seriously -- at the ballot box and beyond. As voters, we must reject efforts to undermine our elections and ensure that every vote, especially those of service members, is counted. If we fail to protect voters now, we risk undermining the very foundations of our democracy. We owe it to our troops, our veterans, and our nation to ensure that every vote counts -- no matter where it's cast. Come Election Day, let's make sure those who tried to suppress military votes regret it at the polls.

      "\"I believe in America\" is the first line you hear in The Godfather . A troubled funeral home proprietor by the name of Amerigo Bonasera has come to see Don Corleone to seek revenge for his daughter, wronged by two young Anglo-Saxon men. The movie at its core is an immigrant's story shorn of bootstrapping Horatio Alger fantasies or any notions of smooth integration into society. The film and book tell rather of old world traditions mingling, enhancing, and corrupting the democratic experiment with often spectacularly bloody results. The America of the Godfather was not so much the melting pot described by middle school teachers everywhere but a roiling cauldron of special interests, parochial beliefs, and -- most of all -- cutthroat strivers. It was the real story of coming to a foreign land and trying to make good. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention , Kamala Harris told a wildly different version of that story, when she spoke of her mother's struggles coming to America. But The Godfather's author Mario Puzo or its director, Francis Ford Coppola couldn't have done it better. Her immigrant mother and father from disparate backgrounds, eventually separated. She spoke of the tight circle her mother built around the family -- taking in an abused young friend of Harris, encouraging her daughter to fight back to protect her friends. The five-foot Shyamala Harris' accent may have made her sound unlike other folks, but she wasn't going to take shit from anyone. Her daughter told the DNC audience how Shyamala worked as hard as she could to provide but times were hard and resources limited. They got by, but maybe not by much, and still she opened her doors to those in need. \"My mother understood the importance of taking care of people, especially when they are exposed to hurt or pain,\" Harris recently told Rolling Stone 's Alex Morris . \"And I was raised to feel that same way.\" (It's unimaginable to think of slumlord Fred Trump offering any such lessons to his son Donald.) Harris described the sort of neighborhood with open doors and parents working together that is ingrained in our collective imaginations of what this country is supposed to be all about. \"I grew up in a community where people took care of each other,\" Harris told us. In telling her personal story, Kamala Harris has once again taken the narrative of the American Dream and made it that of the Democratic Party. She's made it OK to be a proud Democrat again, or at least more acceptable in polite rooms. For all Joe Biden's legislative accomplishments, he'd lost the confidence of most people. He was, as the first presidential debate showed, demonstrably too old for the job. His performance had so shaken the party that one operative told me that during the first presidential debate he felt like he was \"watching someone die.\" At the DNC, Harris spoke forcefully. She wrapped herself in the flag, spoke of economic opportunity, and a strong national defense. She talked of prosecuting criminals and the threat of Iran. She was persuading gettable voters and trying to win an election, like a normal politician. Social issues aside, if you didn't know better, this could have been a speech from a Republican National Convention of, say, any time before 2016. The stark contrast with Donald Trump and his bizarre RNC was devastatingly effective. Harris laid out a vision of the country that is almost comforting in its familiarity and unapologetically patriotic. She loves this country and wants to make it better. Trump's apocalyptic fever dreams look like just that -- twisted fantasies stirred up in Breitbart keggers or Steven Miller's basement dungeon. Trump has a narrative of failure, fear, and carnage. He wants to deport millions. Abandon allies. Start trade wars. The country he describes, from the safety of his gated and gilded palace, is not recognizable or even close to reality. We have all kinds of threats, problems, and struggles, no doubt, but his scenarios are the paranoid delusions of a nativist and narcissistic mind. He ignores the climate crisis and scapegoats the most marginalized. After four years in office, his legislative accomplishments amount to a massive tax cut for the very wealthy and little else. An immigrant supplicant like Amerigo Bonasera would likely never get past the front gate at Mar-a-Lago, nor would he ever seek justice for his daughter from a man who has openly boasted about molesting women and been a found liable by a jury of sexual abuse. But if Amerigo could find his way to Harris, he'd find a sympathetic and a righteous ear bent on finding justice within the law. Whatever happens in this election, Kamala Harris made clear she believes in America too.\n"

      "I used to hate Jimmy Carter more than anything else in this world. Let me explain. It's November 1979 in Oak Harbor, Washington, and I'm counting days. 24, 23, 22. I'm in the eighth grade. After school, I fold and then deliver the Seattle Times on Whidbey Island, the second-largest island in the continental United States as our teachers like to remind us. I am counting days until I fly from Seattle to Honolulu to meet my dad, Commander Peter Rodrick, and ride back to San Diego with him on the USS Kitty Hawk. The voyage will take six days, longer than I've ever spent alone with him. Finally, there will be time. I can come clean about faking sick so I could watch the Red Sox-Yankees one-game playoff last October. The Sox are Dad's team. He'll understand. Finally, I can learn what my father does. I know he flies jets off carriers, but how? Finally, I can ask him why things seem so hard all the time. He is counting days, too. His letters to mom always mark the days left of his six-month deployment as skipper of VAQ-135, the Black Ravens. He asks her to hold on a little longer. She's taking care of me and my two sisters alone and I can be a pain in the ass. (\"I know Steve is probably getting excited and driving you crazy but 10 December will be here soon and you'll have some peace and quiet.\") I'm a nerd who can't hit a baseball, but I can tell you the Electoral College breakdown of the 1976 Carter-Ford election. I read the paper closely as I fold and rubber band them into my carrier bag. I begin to see photographs on the front page of American hostages in Tehran, blindfolded and terrified. But I don't connect all the dots. At school, I spend my newspaper money on five ice cream sandwiches for lunch and taunt David Tapia about how I'm heading to Hawaii and he's not. I turn 13 and receive a note from Dad: \"Happy 13 th , Welcome To Being A Teenager -- Yuck!\" The Kitty Hawk is just running out the clock. The carrier is in Subic Bay in the Philippines where ordnance is loaded off and empty ammunition stores are filled with recently purchased stereo equipment, wooden plates for the wives, and black-market Adidas bags for the kids. Dad writes a letter on the back of a Naval Air Station Cubi Point menu -- \"I'm broke\" -- giving Mom advice about welcome home parties for the squadron. And then, it all changes. I'm cuddled up in bed with some purloined Chips Ahoy cookies, listening to Larry King's overnight radio show, when Mom walks into my room. She is crying. \"Dad needs to talk to you.\" I'm half asleep and he is shouting through a bad connection from the Officers Club bar at Cubi Point. All I get out of the conversation is the trip is off. He won't be home any time soon. On the Kitty Hawk, the stereo equipment is thrown overboard and the bombs are reloaded. I read more the next day. President Jimmy Carter has ordered the Kitty Hawk to head for the Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. The Midway is already there. Carter and the Joint Chiefs believe that two carriers camped off the Iranian coast might persuade Ayatollah Khomeini to let the hostages go or at least convince him there will be a stiff price to pay if they come to harm. Things go back to a dreary level of normal. A week passes and we spend Thanksgiving with other families at the Navy mess on base. On Nov. 28, my classmates and I take a short bus ride to the Roller Barn, where the other kids make fun of me for not being able to skate backwards. And then my teacher taps me on the shoulder and points toward the lobby. There, my dad's best friend sits in his dress uniform. He pats me on the knee. \"Your dad has been in an accident.\" I return home and there is a black sedan outside our house. A few hours later, we get the official news: My father and three fellow aviators have been killed when their EA-6B Prowler crashes into the Indian Ocean near Diego Garcia on a low-level training mission meant to simulate an attack on Tehran. Dad is 36. And I blame it all on Jimmy Carter. I KNOW IT isn't rational, but I base it on some facts. Not only did Carter send my father into harm's way, but on Oct. 29, 1979, he allowed the despotic and deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment. That is the immediate cause for Iranian students, at Khomeini's behest, to storm the embassy and take the hostages a week later. And I know my dad and his fellow pilots didn't like the man, even though he went to the Naval Academy just like many of them. I remember them sitting around our house the summer before, drinking Coors and declaring his presidency a disaster. They see Carter as something of a joke and cringe when he delivers a speech saying a malaise and a crisis of confidence has spread across the country they were sworn to defend. Carter is the first Democratic president after the Vietnam debacle and they see the Georgian, a former submarine officer, as weak, not willing to defend America's interests overseas with force. (The irony that it was the previously unseen military muscle of Carter and his hawkish Middle East policy that led to my father's death won't hit me until much later.) I wish I could say the feeling passes after a mourning period, but it does not. I dance around like a madman in an end-zone celebration when Carter loses to Ronald Reagan the next year. By then, we have moved to Flint, Michigan, to be closer to family. I attend Catholic high school, because that's what Dad would have wanted. At school, I form with another kid, whose estranged father happens to also be a Navy pilot, the Conservative Liberation Organization, a cringy ad hoc of weirdo kids -- Stephen Miller definitely would have joined -- intent on stamping out the Democratic Party and its commie liberal policies. I am the one kid in class who will write a full defense of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative for the school paper. Occasionally, Carter appears on our television. I curse and ball my fists together in rage. The phase does not pass quickly. I go away to college and mock students who are protesting student aid cuts as Reagan jacks up the military budget. I sneer and shout at them, \"We all have to make sacrifices for our country.\" I go into therapy and, sure, it's a lot about Mom and the loss of my dad, but Carter comes up a lot. He is the one who ruined my life, he is the one who caused Mom to be left alone and broken. The therapist tries to reason with me, but I do not hear. Then something happens, not connected to my father or Carter. I move to Chicago and I see the poverty in the rows and rows of high-rise public housing tenements lining the South Side. And I remember thinking that my father would have wept at all of this urban despair. And I remember that, yes, he was a hotshot Navy pilot, but he also was a man of God who went to Mass every day. After his crash, the priest on the Kitty Hawk writes to my mother to say that somehow, despite his 100-hour weeks doing the job he worked all his life to attain, he also found time to counsel sailors in crisis on the ship. My heart begins to unfreeze. Somewhere, I catch a TV news story of Carter building a house for the less fortunate with his wife, Rosalynn. And I see in their relationship a reflection of my parents' marriage, a love that could survive crisis, separation, and even death. I learn that Carter is devout, a Baptist like my mother, and teaches Sunday School, something my father wanted to do once he left the Navy. And then I talk with my mother. \"I don't blame Carter,\" she tells me. \"Your dad knew the risks; he knew this could happen. He wouldn't want you to hate him.\" I AM A REPORTER and it is not impossible that my paths could crossed with Carter at some point. In fact, I write a book about my father and Navy pilots and initially want to talk with Carter about the burden of sending Americans into harm's way. Eventually, I embed with my father's old squadron and deploy with them. I even get up in a Prowler, my dad's old plane, and fly over Whidbey and look down on my old paper route. My son is born on Nov. 28, 2013, 34 years to the day after my dad's crash. I name him after his grandfather. But I never reach out to Carter. Why? I think I knew I would have broken down in the kind old man's arms. I would have said I was sorry for hating him. And that I forgave him for simply fulfilling the hardest part of a president's job. And I know he would have said he understood. Maybe he would have shed a tear of his own. But I never did it. I guess I am doing it now. President Carter, rest in peace.\n"

      "This article was produced by Capital & Main. It is co-published by Rolling Stone with permission. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , who has just been tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, has quietly become one of the country's most aggressive advocates for taking action on climate change. Under his leadership, Minnesota has adopted some of the most ambitious climate policies in the nation -- including a law he signed in 2023 that requires the state to generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2040. During that legislative session, Walz and state lawmakers pushed through at least 40 other climate-related initiatives . \"The idea [is] that we can create a clean energy future where we can protect our water, protect our land, and do that in a manner that grows the economy in Minnesota,\" Walz said in announcing those initiatives. Under the clean-electricity law, Minnesota is on track to transition to clean-energy sources even faster than California, which is often seen as America's trailblazer when it comes to climate action. It's also more ambitious than a requirement that President Biden tried to include in his landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Walz's selection by Harris was hailed by leading environmental groups. \"In his time serving in Congress and as Governor, he has worked to protect clean air and water, grow our clean energy economy, and see to it that we do all we can to avoid the very worst of the climate crisis ,\" said Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous in a statement. \"Governor Tim Walz's unwavering commitment to bold action led to the biggest thing our state has ever done to address the climate crisis, and we have been proud to partner with him on many initiatives to reduce dangerous pollution and protect our Great Outdoors,\" said Conservation Minnesota Voter Center Executive Director Paul Austin. Walz's evolution on the issue grew with the impact of climate change he saw in his home state. He was a school teacher and football coach and served in the Army National Guard before he was elected to Congress in 2006, serving six terms and supporting environmental legislation but not known as a climate champion. In his first run for Congress in 2006, he didn't mention global warming on his campaign website, unlike other progressive candidates, and talked about \"energy independence.\" But in recent years the impact of climate change on the state has been intense -- such as wildfire smoke from Canada polluting the air over Minneapolis, extreme drought prompting farmers to cull their herds and experiencing crop failure, and torrential rains causing flooding. And Walz has become more of a climate advocate -- establishing a climate change subcabinet within his administration in 2019 and announcing a plan in 2022 to increase sales of electric vehicles to 20% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. And two weeks ago, in his latest action, he welcomed a $200 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce climate pollution in the state with new equipment for farmers, food waste prevention, peatland restoration and electric vehicles. Walz has been hailed for his skills at communicating the need for climate policies and renewable energy initiatives. \"The surest way to get people to buy in is to create a job that pays well in their community,\" he told Time magazine recently. \"All of us are going to have to be better about our smart politics, about bringing people in.\" Sometimes, that focus on jobs has led him to work with polluting industries, raising concerns among environmentalists. Last month, a coalition of 16 Minnesota environmental groups called out state agencies for lax regulation of industry and accusing the agencies of \"polluter capture\" -- when industry has sway over regulatory decision-making -- citing examples of the approval of a controversial oil pipeline in northern Minnesota and the failure to take action against a polluting foundry in Minneapolis. In a written statement to Sahan Journal , the Walz administration said: \"The state has a strong record of holding polluters accountable and working with the community and the legislature to ensure health and our natural resources are protected.\"\n",

      "A former senior executive in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Naj divides his time between overseeing medicine companies he has founded and writing; his latest book, Pandastic Times (Brazen House), is a fable of the Covid pandemic. Some two decades ago, when I mentioned what I did for a living -- manufacturing and marketing a wide range of prescription drugs -- it elicited appreciative reactions from acquaintances. \"I take your products every day,\" a number of them would offer; others would mention how a specific medicine had made all the difference to their health and would ask whether a more advanced treatment was in the works; some simply marveled at the industry's innovations as nothing less than miracles. Then there were some who teased: \"Good business; you can charge whatever price.\" I considered the quip an acknowledgment that lifesaving discoveries were worth the money. Pharma Man, they called me. It seemed to confer a certain respectability, of the sort reserved for a physician or a scientist or a teacher. There was a presumption in it, too, that I lived by certain ideals and ethics demanded of such an avocation. I was proud of being a Pharma Man. Alas, I have now slipped precipitously in their eyes. I am seen as an avaricious man inexorably exploiting the misery of fellow human beings for profit -- by inventing one new magic potion after another for which they cannot afford not to pay my price, because the only alternative would be pain and suffering, even death. My onetime champions have grudgingly tolerated this collective subjugation for years. But not anymore. Their festering anger has now broken into an open rebellion against the Pharma Man, the benevolent oppressor. The recent murder of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood, a heinous and deplorable expression of this growing rebellion, cannot be condoned in any way. But the health care landscape is littered with provocations against the Pharma Man which play out daily on national television, in the newspapers, and on social media. The Pharma Man's reputation is only going to get worse as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and tries to fulfill his promise to bring down drug prices. And there is the specter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. bringing his unconventional ideas to American health care in the new Trump administration; he has already publicly called for capping drug prices. Ironically, it had been the Democrats who made the industry -- a financial hotbed of Republican support -- a whipping boy in blaming America's failure to deliver affordable health care to its citizens. But Mr. Trump has outshouted them all. He famously declared that pharma companies were \"getting away with murder\" and singled out Pfizer Inc. and publicly shamed the company and forced the CEO to roll back planned price increases. As I watched Mr. Trump tower over the CEO at a White House appearance and later triumphantly declare the result of his disciplinary action, I was reminded of my school days when the headmaster would hoist a student by the collar to make the truant admit culpability in front of the class. It was humiliating for the Pharma Man, for I once worked at the company, proud of its pioneering history and its roster of some of the world's most impactful medicines, a company that would go on to save millions of lives with its Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic. But the Pharma Man has earned this new reputation, and then some. Nothing has been as devastating to the industry's image as the ongoing opioid crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because companies capriciously pushed sales of the addictive painkillers. The bribing of doctors with cash and sex to prescribe the drugs, widely reported in the media, revealed to the American public the means and the measure of the Pharma Man's extraordinary avarice. Although much of the hostility is focused on Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, a number of pharma companies with household names, among them Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, have been named in government investigations for directly or indirectly participating in perpetrating the opioid crisis. This follows a string of well-publicized, similar cases in which drug companies have been ostracized for their single-minded devotion to profit. In 2016, millions of television viewers must have felt sick to their stomachs listening to the CEO of Mylan admitting to lawmakers that the company had jacked up the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving treatment for allergic reaction, by 400 percent, because it could in the absence of any competition. The same year, in another congressional hearing, Martin Shkreli, the brash CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the moniker \"Bad Boy of Pharma\" in the media as he mocked lawmakers and refused to answer when asked why his company had raised prices of decades-old drugs a whopping 5,000 percent. As these very public spectacles played out on national television, they reinforced the perception of millions of Americans who struggle daily with filling their prescriptions and securing coverage from their health insurers, that they are dealing with the devil. I work in a business that's a highly sophisticated, science-driven enterprise, peopled by brilliant minds, who truly take special pride in what they do. They are not given to making sanctimonious claims that they wake up every morning to save the world -- as their companies might in their corporate banners (\"Your life is our life's work\"; \"Your health is our mission\") -- but in their subconscious lurks a deep sense of satisfaction, even joy, that their work ends up easing pain and suffering and saving lives. They see palpable evidence every day in their family members and friends who take the medicines they help bring to the world. But you would never know all this from their public reputation. In annual Gallup polls, the Pharma Man's business consistently ranks at the very bottom of all industries in public trust, and even in that dishonorable position it slipped further in 2023. Professionally, the Pharma Man ranks below the car salesman for honesty and ethics. It is baffling to me that we as an industry haven't stepped out in front of the groundswell of national outrage and undertaken systemic changes to our business practices. We continue to conduct our business on the strength of our power over our customers, a power we derive from our possession of the inventions that prevent and treat and cure and which our customers cannot do without. That's like possessing Tolkien's One Ring, which gives the possessor unassailable power to rule over and dominate others. We set the price we want. We can cast our spell on doctors to prescribe our medicine and do our bidding. We can banish competitors who attempt to lay claim to our Ring of Power. We have institutionalized this leverage in our business, all the way from drug discovery and development to marketing and sales and distribution. This underpinning of the industry's colossal machinery is rigged against the patient. No one in the leadership of the pharma industry has raised a voice, let alone stepped up to act, to alter this unfair state endured by their very own customers; it seems there are no hobbits in the industry ready to undertake the treacherous journey to Mount Doom in a quest to destroy the Ring. We refuse to see how our customers see our business. In their minds, we owe our existence to their misfortunes and mishaps: the unexpected cancer, the heart that suddenly fails, the pancreas that fails to produce enough insulin. Our customers turn to us to help them deal with these events of life and living. Although they know it takes a lot of money and time to come up with a treatment, they also expect the pharma company to make it available to them at an affordable price. After all, they argue, axiomatically, the drug was specifically developed to serve their need, brought on by their unfortunate luck. They volunteer in tens of thousands, sick and healthy, for a new drug to be tested on them so the company can prove it works and is safe; some can die from the potential side effects. They are the ones who help create the market for the drug. And to dangle it in front of them but out of their reach by charging unaffordable prices is unconscionable. It is hard to argue against that view: the symbiotic existence between our enterprise and our customers imposes a business -- not to mention a moral -- obligation on us to make the drug affordable to the patient who was instrumental in the development of the treatment in the first place. We also should not ignore the fact that the U.S. government helps out drug development with taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, our customers cannot rely on market forces for what the pharma companies won't offer: a fair deal. Car companies, with their zillion features, battle among themselves to win over customers, and any and all of their cars, irrespective of their features, deliver the same result: transporting the buyer from one place to another. One can purchase any smartphone on the market and it will make the call, send messages, browse the web. But when it comes to drugs, the consumer doesn't necessarily have alternative choices. Take, for instance, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins. Among the seven or so statins developed so far, the most prescribed ones are atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor). Each statin has its own distinct efficacy and side effects, even though they all lower cholesterol. Physicians prescribe one statin or another based on patient condition and the desired outcome. In effect, the market of cholesterol-lowering agents gets divided into distinct segments of therapy, each offering just one single statin. Within each segment there is no competition to speak of (until the patent expires, allowing the entry of copies of the product, the so-called generics). Although the manufacturers compete with their sales and marketing campaigns to recruit patients to their respective statins, this sort of \"competition\" doesn't significantly influence the price, as each product is viewed as distinct and un-substitutable, something that the manufacturers take pains to establish with their scientific papers and promotional materials. We are known to shamelessly exploit these monopolistic powers. When we lose a patent on a drug, we pay off competitors to keep them from entering the market. (The Federal Trade Commission estimates that these anticompetitive tactics cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in higher drug costs every year.) Most commonly, we tend to extend patents with minor variations on the original drug, such as a new coating or a slight change in the formulation -- this is called evergreening -- which offer little or no additional benefits to the patient. (Some 78 percent of the patented drugs marketed between 2005 and 2015 are not new drugs, according to a study published in the Journal of the Law and the Biosciences in December 2018.) Some of our tactics are simply mean. An example: An innovator company that had been selling a medicine in 20- and 40-milligram tablets retired the products once their patents expired and then relaunched only the 40-mg tablet with a score mark in the center. The indented mark would allow the tablet to be evenly split into two halves. The innovator would then use its marketing muscle to corral physicians to endorse it as a single two-in-one pill: 40 mg, and 20 mg when it's split in two. The two-in-one becomes the new fashion. A generic company that developed unscored tablets is suddenly out of luck; its products fall out of favor with the prescribing physicians, even though the innovator's scored version offers no improvement in efficacy. We justify the constant push for ever more profit by pointing to the nature of our business. The pursuit of drug discovery and development is inherently risky; there is no other industry that takes on such enormous risks to bring a product to the market. In pharmaceuticals, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to the market, sometimes upwards of a billion or more. Most drugs in development don't make it. And when a drug does make it, there is a mad rush to recover the investments, including the money lost in all the unsuccessful earlier attempts. The race is against the clock, before the drug's patent expires, usually within 12 or 13 years after launch. Any thought of making the drug affordable is subsumed by the urgency of squeezing profit out of a drug, no matter how old. So the industry takes the stance that lifesaving discoveries come at a price -- and the patient must pay for it. But our customers don't believe us when we say drug costs are so high because of R&D costs. We do not publish independently audited numbers to substantiate our claims. R&D costs can be inflated by assigning high values to the intellectual and financial capital invested in the drug, for instance. What makes our customers even more skeptical is that we spend far more on marketing our products -- those screaming ads on TV and in subways -- which adds enormously to the drug's cost, while strengthening our monopolistic hold on our products. A large truth is that our drug pricing is heavily influenced by our single-minded obsession with keeping our shareholders -- not patients -- happy. This is not unique to the pharma industry; delivering \"shareholder value,\" the appreciation of the company's stock price, is an operational mantra of corporations across industries. Whatever earnest exercise a pharma company goes through to set drug prices based on R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and other costs, at the end of the day this is all swept aside by the pressures to achieve quarterly and annual sales and profit targets. Executives' bonuses are tied to achieving these performance metrics, and their stock grants and options deliver additional riches when the company's stock appreciates. The pressures to serve the shareholder have only intensified in the past decade as the health care industry has become a sought-after vehicle for investors for the safe and steady and stellar returns it offers. Pharmaceuticals' net profit margins are in the range of 15 to 20 percent, compared to 4 to 9 percent for large non-drug companies. A single successful drug can generate billions of dollars in sales, some as much as $15 billion or more annually. Many of our single pills, if incorporated into a company, would rank among the Fortune 500 companies. Investors bet on our drugs long before they reach the market. They pore over scientific papers and decipher results of early-stage clinical trials of a drug with the zeal of a geologist prospecting for oil. They swarm medical and scientific conferences where the latest findings and opinions about a drug's progress are presented. Living up to their expectations or, better yet, exceeding them becomes a high priority for companies setting their future financial performance targets. The patient is nowhere in the picture; few in executive suites agonize over whether to lower a price by 10 or 15 percent so many more patients can afford the drug. The concept of affordability is not an operational imperative in the business, largely because top executives rarely interact with customers -- the patients -- to be sensitized to their needs, their plight really. In the car and smartphone industries, senior executives go around shaking hands with their customers and host regular conventions to take the pulse of their customers' desires. In pharmaceuticals, a typical CEO's calendar is filled with meetings with Wall Street analysts and fund managers, and the job of interacting with the customer is left to prescribing physicians, whom sales reps regularly badger with sales pitches. But these prescribers we rely on to do our bidding with patients have lost public trust. The opioid crisis exposed a large number of doctors accepting bribes, as much as $100,000 a year, and sexual services to push sales. Although this is the most publicized example of corruption among doctors, there are many others that haven't drawn much public attention. Nearly all Big Pharma companies have paid fines, some multiple times, to settle charges of bribing doctors. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay more than $2.2 billion in fines to settle charges that it had improperly promoted an antipsychotic drug; the government alleged that the company had paid \"speaker fees to doctors to influence them to write prescriptions\" and that its sales representatives \"told these doctors that if they wanted to receive payments for speaking, they needed to increase\" their prescriptions of the drug. In China, the world's second-largest economy and the fastest-growing pharma market, the British drugmaker GSK paid a $499 million fine in 2014, and several top executives pleaded guilty for bribing doctors to promote company products; it was a headline-grabbing government investigation that revealed humiliating details about how the company used hundreds of travel agencies to entertain doctors in exotic places and to dispense cash to them and tried to influence regulatory authorities. Other big-name multinational pharma companies -- including Novartis, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Pfizer -- have also been snared in bribery investigations in China, and have paid fines. While these unethical practices in China, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market, have grabbed headlines, they go unnoticed in Asia and Africa. In the pharmaceutical industry, influence peddling goes much deeper, to the very core of its business -- the research and development -- unlike in any other industry. Companies recruit leading researchers and academics to guide them during drug development, and to publicly pronounce their expert opinions in medical journals once the drug is successfully launched to the public. As critical as this alliance is to the successful development of a drug, it is now widely questioned because of these influencers' financial ties to pharmaceutical companies. ProPublica, a non-profit investigative journalism organization, has exposed several leading researchers and academics for accepting money from pharmaceutical companies which they didn't disclose -- or did so falsely -- in connection with the scientific articles they published, some in prestigious journals like the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. Among the prominent researchers ProPublica cited was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the nation's leading cancer institute; he bullishly pitched to the investment community a new cancer treatment being developed by Roche without disclosing his financial ties to the company. What's worthy of note is that this nationally respected cancer researcher didn't seem to care that investors thought the product was a dud, a product that Roche would eventually scrap. The ethics of the scientist, who resigned in 2018, didn't stand in the way of the company's zeal for commercial success with the product. But then it is not unusual for a pharmaceutical company to influence, even shape, what the medical influencers present about its endeavors to investors and the public at large. Unfortunately, this dark underbelly of the industry is exposed only when an enterprise like ProPublica steps in with the full force of its investigative resources. There is little government oversight today to effectively block the bias in medical practice that results from the financial ties of medical practitioners with the pharmaceutical companies. But there is a website devoted to exposing and shaming both parties. If you want to find out if your doctor is receiving any money -- how much and for what -- from a company whose drug he or she is prescribing to you, you can go to the website Dollars for Docs and type in the name of the doctor. The site is the brainchild of ProPublica. It brings to mind the comparison with the U.S. Justice Department's National Sex Offender Registry for the identity and location of known sex offenders. In a world where doctors and researchers and medical academics all work as an army of influencers, the patient exists only as the customer to be influenced. It is a most peculiar aspect of our industry that we market our products to doctors (who help generate sales for us but don't pay for the products) and we sell to our actual customers, the patients (who pay but have no control over the price they pay). Who decides the price? A very small group of wholesalers called pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), owned by large insurers -- CVS Health (which owns Aetna), Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthCare -- that have been accused of padding their own profits at the cost of the patients they insure. These middlemen buy drugs on behalf of government and private employers and insurance companies. They negotiate prices with the pharma companies. It may sound bewildering that the customers who pay for the drugs cannot negotiate directly with the manufacturers, unlike in the rest of the world. Even Medicare, the country's largest health plan, covering 60 million Americans, can't. In effect, the market forces of supply and demand -- the backbone of all other commerce in America -- are shielded from each other by the opaque wall of the middlemen. Imagine if the price of your car or a smartphone were negotiated by a handful of middlemen and you had no choice but to pay. Today, 44 percent of Americans are either uninsured or underinsured; a 2021 national survey estimated that 46 million people couldn't afford quality health care. Such news fails to register as profoundly worrisome in the psyches of pharmaceutical executives, largely because they are shielded from the customer by the systemic structure of the industry. Reports in the morning papers of patients unable to buy a lifesaving drug -- like the news of Americans with diabetes struggling to procure high-priced insulin -- might as well be the day's weather report to them. Stories of struggles from further afield, like distant corners of Asia and Africa, where patients die because they can't afford a blood pressure or cancer medicine, have even less of a chance of stirring the collective conscience of the industry. I am often asked if I think drug prices are high, in the sense that they are unreasonable and exploitative. I've had difficulty answering the question in the past with a definitive yes or no, because many of the drugs have had such a profound impact in banishing diseases and prolonging healthy life. Their discovery didn't come easy. I would respond that the prices reflected the cost of innovation, but that they could be lower. That conditional justification is harder to make these days. More than 80 percent of the prescription drugs sold in the U.S. are generics, copies of patent-expired drugs. As copies, they have very low development costs. Their main costs lie in raw materials and manufacturing. And that cost is a fraction of the price the consumer currently pays for generics. I should know, because I manufacture many of them. For instance, a box of 30 five-milligram tablets of amlodipine, one of the most prescribed blood pressure medications, costs less than 30 cents to manufacture, and retails for $7 to $8.90 online and in U.S. drugstores, ostensibly discounted from $20 to $30. Simvastatin, a commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering medication, costs less than 40 cents for a pack of 30 20-mg tablets; it sells at $7.87 to $22.28, discounted from $12 to $30. Even after adding the cost of marketing and distribution, the selling prices of these drugs are astronomical. The consulting firm Pharmacy Benefit Consultants, which provides prescription coverage services to private and government employers, says the average wholesale prices -- before the drug is sold to the patient -- have been rising at \"shocking rates.\" Between the beginning of 2017 and March of 2018, it reports, the average wholesale prices of 450 drugs increased by between 25 and 100 percent. They included sharp increases for branded drugs that lost patents many years ago, such as 19.8 to 31 percent for Zoloft, which lost its patent in 2006, and 31.1 percent for Lipitor, which lost its patent in 2011. IT IS TIME FOR US to step up and make ourselves accountable to our customers, or else it will inevitably be done for us, as President Joe Biden did by capping the cost of insulin for seniors last year. Or maybe Mr. Trump will dangle a CEO by the collar in front of a national audience and humiliate him and demand admission of guilt and price cuts. Meanwhile, many government actions are in the works to limit prices of drugs across the board. And more than two dozen states have filed legal actions against pharmaceutical companies to force them to disclose how they price their products. Unfortunately, the industry today lacks leaders who can respond to these threats by spearheading a systemic change in the business practices that have brought on such public wrath. The industry has not produced in recent history a single business leader with the acumen -- let alone the vision -- to strategically pursue profit without abandoning the concurrent obligation to serve the patient. A bottom-line focus leads to appointing an accountant at the helm, or a lawyer if the company is mired in legal challenges, or a scientist simply because the company lacks a robust product line. There is nothing wrong with such choices if the chosen leader can strategically manage the twin missions of a health care company: ensuring that most patients can buy the drug while pursuing profit to enable research for the next big cure. Alas, none has emerged we can hold up as an example. That is pathetic. Because the genesis of the modern pharma industry is anchored on the idea of delivering medicine at affordable costs. Inventors of insulin and antibiotics -- the two most seminal discoveries in pharmaceuticals -- refused to patent their inventions so everyone would have access to these lifesaving drugs at low costs. That mission seems not to have inspired the modern-day leaders in the slightest. There is no Henry Ford, Walter Chrysler, William Durant, Thomas Watson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, or Elon Musk in the pharma industry. Pharmaceutical company boards are stacked with renowned business leaders from other industries and leading academics and Nobel laureates, but it is not discernible to me what worldly difference these outsiders have made to the conduct of the industry, which year after year has come under attack from its own customers and whose rage is now boiling over. What might a visionary do if one were to burst onto the scene today? One can imagine a Michael Dell mass-producing drugs -- like he did with his Dell computer -- and selling them at reasonable prices and yet making a stellar profit by reaching a large number of customers. Henry Ford did that with the Model T; he didn't lie awake thinking of how to make it exclusive; he pioneered mass production as a way of maximizing profit by reaching the greatest number of customers possible. Perhaps a visionary would create a low-cost, no-frills brand of the expensive patented drug -- like Herb Keller's low-budget airline -- without compromising on efficacy and safety. A Jeff Bezos would recast the industry by tossing out the middlemen and corruptible medical professionals. A pioneer would slash prices of some of the newest lifesaving biologic drugs -- cutting-edge medicines for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis -- to make them affordable, and would have the savviness to negotiate with the government an extended period of patent protection. Perhaps a visionary would model himself or herself after Warren Buffett and invite thousands of those who buy the company's products to a gathering and mingle with them over barbecue and the strumming of a banjo to celebrate life and inspire the company with the grateful voices of the customers. That would make the Pharma Man proud.\n"

      "It's Sunday afternoon near the Washington Monument and the clouds overhead are suitably dark and impenetrable. All your friends are here. The accidentally Russia-funded Tim Pool slips into a VIP tent while Russell Brand shows off his chest hair to his partner Jordan Peterson , the victor in many imagined battles against cultural Marxism. He is dressed as a cartoon villain in a suit that is half red and half blue. Nearby, Bashar al-Assad and Putin cheerleader Tulsi Gabbard prepares to call Kamala Harris a warmonger from the stage. Welcome to the Rescue the Republic rally, featuring many stars of the fabled Vaccines Are Bullshit rally of 2022. The \"just because I am paranoid it doesn't mean that the Feds are not following me\" crowd is here for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but first there are many warmup acts. Comedy edgelord Rob Schneider is the master of ceremonies, and has already trotted out his Saturday Night Live Mexican-stereotype character that was created a third of a century ago. (The crowd here is almost all-white, and the number of Latinos and African Americans here could fit into a Hampton Inn conference room.) Joints are loosened by stretching exercises administered by Nathaniel Garrard \"Garry\" Lineham, the leader of a wellness organization called Human Garage. Lineham has few credentials in the health field, but he does have a felony conviction from 2010 for creating and distributing encrypted cellphones to a West Coast drug ring . Something called Tennessee Jet sings a protest song of sorts: The kids are overdosing on fentanyl The door is wide open at the border wall D.C.'s busy sellin' out us all Unless it's Ukraine, they ain't takin' calls Politicians whorin' for the war machine Laundering money in the name of peace Dressing up Zelensky in Army green Marchin' us right off into World War III Can't wait for Jet to rhyme Netanyahu with boogaloo. That won't happen because there is almost zero mention of the Israeli war on Gaza today, maybe because RFK Jr. supports the conflict . Maybe it was because he suffered blowback when he said the status of anti-vaxxers in America was akin to Anne Frank's plight . Or maybe it's because Kennedy once proclaimed , \" Covid -19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\" Anyway, Schneider brings out a conga line of discredited scientists and doctors, some wearing lab coats. Dr. Pierre Kory takes the podium. He is an ivermectin evangelist who once said, \"I think what happened is that at the outset of the pandemic, it was decided that all information must go in one direction, from the gods of science down.\" Kory, whose medical license expired in 2022, now oversees a telemedicine clinic that, according to The Washington Post , \"can receive prescriptions for ivermectin, costing $1,650 for a video consultation and two follow-ups.\" Today, he describes the Covid-19 vaccine as a catastrophe that has cost \"millions\" of lives. This is exactly untrue, but absolutely on point. The crowd claps, but they are getting itchy. They start to chant. \"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.\" SURE, I AM HERE IN DRIZZLY D.C. for the unintentional comedy, but also because this is fucking important. In its now 248-year history, ignoring bullshit hasn't worked out well for the United States. In 1898, William Randolph Hearst, the Andrew Breitbart of his time, drove us into the Spanish Civil War with cries of \"Remember the Maine ,\" an American ship not blown up by the Spanish. A century later, Colin Powell spoke of aluminum tubes as a pretext to justify the invasion of Iraq. Conspiracies have infected our political parties for centuries. In the 1840s, there was an actual Know-Nothing Party that spread hate and lies about Catholics. The John Birch Society emerged in the 1950s and preached that President Dwight Eisenhower was a communist agent. It's not a long way from that fantastical claim to Donald Trump arguing that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. HBO has a new documentary, Stopping the Steal, on Trump's efforts to illegally overturn the 2020 election. The preponderance of the election officials believed that no one could possibly take seriously a movement led by a lawyer invoking Venezuelan involvement and \"releasing the Kraken,\" while Rudy Giuliani's hair dye ran down his jowls . Four years later, the vast majority of Republicans believe that the whole election was rigged. Ignore it at our own peril. It's hard to gauge how much impact RFK's depleted army will have on the election, but to overlook his nonsense forgets the fact that crackpots like Ralph Nader and Jill Stein had outsize impact on the 2000 and 2016 elections that set this country on a path of misery and death. I can already hear the Kennedy folk suggesting I am calling for censorship of inconvenient ideas and candidates. Nope, I say there is no better time than 30 days out from Election Day to put RFK Jr. and his followers under the microscope, ants exposed to a thousand beams of light. AFTER SELLING WHAT WAS LEFT of his ideals down the Potomac with his endorsement of Donald Trump, few of Kennedy's alt-famous cohorts have abandoned him. Many of them are here today. Most of them have been canceled or shamed or blown up their own careers, just like RFK has done repeatedly. Others just share his character trait of being egomaniac assholes. They have congealed behind Kennedy into a political movement based on the credo \"Give me your arrested, your discredited, your huddled victims yearning to blame their problems on the deep state.\" They now follow Bobby in a new sect of the no-shamers. Today's rally is organized by evolutionary biologist and longtime Tucker Carlson friend Bret Weinstein. Weinstein is a former professor at Evergreen College who was driven out by idiot students who wanted all white people to leave the campus for a day of protest. Weinstein, an early Bernie Sanders supporter, became the tip of the spear of right-wing conversion therapy that can be summarized as, \"I experienced a traumatic political event, and rather than get over it, I have abandoned all my core beliefs. And now I am an AM Radio Republican.\" Weinstein takes the stage early in the day and declares Rescue the Republic a nonpartisan event. He suggests that everyone here is possibly risking their life, and makes the second joke -- after Schneider -- about how many extremists here were FBI. I laugh and hitch up my khakis. Weinstein stresses the profound importance of everyone having a voice, no matter their views, no matter their past. \"If millions of Americans are afraid to exercise their most fundamental right in their own capital, that implies the capital is held by a force that is hostile to the republic and her people,\" says Weinstein, his brow furrowed. \"Speech is our right and our duty. It is the alternative to violence, coercion, and tyranny.\" His noble words crumble a few hours later. Weinstein is approached by an obnoxious media prankster. The dude asks the Rescue the Republic founder whether his \"brother\" Harvey is innocent. Weinstein unravels. He grabs the guy's camera, removes the memory card, and storms away. The camera is eventually returned without the memory card. A whiff of moral superiority permeates the rally. I received a long email the week before the event from someone named Mindy after I contacted Rescue the Republic about getting a credential. I have looked into some of your articles. I would like to personally inquire with you that you are open to being a strength in the media who might step up for the better of the American people and not for a biased agenda...Maybe not everyone believes you care enough to be willing to try to be fair, but I personally believe in creating a bridge between the divide and offering the opportunity to everyone to stand together... This cri de coeur is followed up by a distressed voicemail from a man named Trevor. I call him back, and he immediately declares our conversation on background, but I will say that he kept me on the phone for a half hour with an unnatural stew of New Age empty calories excusing RFK's endorsement of Donald Trump. I want to jump out a window, but I am in a friend's basement. Trevor name-drops some of his former clients -- the Intercept, Planned Parenthood, and Moveon.org -- to suggest he was a true progressive. It doesn't take long for me to figure out it is Trevor FitzGibbon, who closed his public-relations firm in 2015 amid multiple sex-pest allegations. He was never charged, but eventually released a statement saying, \"I am sincerely sorry for my behavior and for any women who were harmed.\" It reminds me of something RFK's new friend once said: \"Only the best people.\" IT HAS BEEN A HELL OF A SUMMER FOR RFK Jr. even by Kennedy-family standards. As his independent presidential campaign floundered, Kennedy was denied a meeting with Kamala Harris. He then called Trump and inadvertently posted video of the confidential call, and had to apologize for his oopsie. It was then reported, in descending order, that he faked a bike collision in Central Park with a dead bear he had stashed in his trunk, cut off the head of a dead whale and strapped it to the roof of his car with the blood dripping on his children, and then was implicated in a sexting scandal with a magazine reporter who had recently profiled him. Still, Kennedy would undoubtedly describe his summer as full brat because he tied his wagon to Trump's presidential campaign. How it all went down is described from the stage by Del Bigtree, his longtime colleague in vaccine nonsense who was communications director for Kennedy's campaign. According to Bigtree, Trump called Kennedy and uttered the following request: \"I want you to help me clean this system up. I want you to help me make America healthy again. I want you to help me stop them poisoning our kids.\" (The statistical probability that the Big Mac-chugging Trump said those words is 0.000000003 percent.) Bigtree then describes the scene as Kennedy wrestled with the decision of whether to endorse Trump. \"Put yourself in his shoes,\" shouts Bigtree. \"My family doesn't want me to do this. The party of my family doesn't want me to do this, and everybody that's worked so hard to put me into a position so that maybe I could win, they don't want me to do this.\" Kennedy did it anyway, just like he ran for president without their blessings. I'm not sure if discarding the pleading of everyone who ever loved you and stood by you as you battled heroin addiction and repeated allegations of sexual creepiness would fall under his uncle's definition of a profile in courage. No matter. RFK's endorsement speech in Phoenix was Totally Bobby, a garden hose of narcissism, half-truths, and no truths. Kennedy declared Trump was on board with his Make America Healthy Again plan, which involves the country moving away from processed foods promoted by Big Agriculture and Big Cereal to a Whole Foods lifestyle of berries and free-range chickens. This seems profoundly unlikely, since corporate execs give Trump tons of money and the ex-president's bloodstream is 43 percent McNuggets. (At the rally, I ask Kennedy ally and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson how he was going to get America's fast-food president to embrace a less-processed world. Johnson replies it would be on the preponderance of evidence he gathers for Trump. \"When Trump sees the results of that,\" Johnson tells me, \"he might do what I did and give up my powdered-sugar doughnuts and turn to a healthier diet.\") A month ago, in Phoenix, RFK relitigated his grievances against the Democratic Party, stating with confidence: \"In an honest system, I believe that I would have won the election. In the system that my father and uncle thrived in. A system with open debates, with fair primaries.\" Standing nearby was Trump, who debated his 2024 primary opponents exactly zero times. JFK, Bobby's uncle, was nominated in 1960 based on 12 inconsequential primaries. RFK's presidential ambitions were predicated on being appointed attorney general by his brother and a carpetbagging New York move to claim a Senate seat. RFK didn't even risk a presidential run in 1968 until Eugene McCarthy scored a startling 42 percent against LBJ in the New Hampshire primary. And the younger Kennedy? He complained that Harris was added to the presidential ballot despite not receiving a single vote. According to my notes, RFK Jr. didn't receive any votes before successfully getting on the majority of the country's presidential ballots. RFK Jr. went on to say that one of the reasons he was endorsing Trump was over his concerns about the curbing of free speech in America. (In the days before and after the speech, Trump called for imprisoning Americans who burned the flag.) Kennedy then mentioned a court case where a federal judge curbed the Biden administration's ability to meet with social media companies to stop the flow of misinformation. Kennedy claimed all the credit. \"This week, a federal judge, Terry Doughty, upheld my injunction against President Biden,\" said Kennedy, \"calling the White House's censorship project 'the most egregious violation of the First Amendment in the history of the United States of America.'\" This was -- surprise! -- misinformation. The quote he attributed to Judge Doughty was from the brief of two states' attorneys general arguing Kennedy's point in a connected case. If Tim Walz made that mistake, the right-wing press would have an erection lasting longer than the prescribed four hours. BACK IN WASHINGTON, I notice that God and ivermectin are battling for supremacy. Both get cheers every time their names come up. The two concepts are equally represented when Russell Brand and Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson take the stage. What can you say about a non-American power couple of a man in a joker suit who almost died while on a meat-only diet and an aging libertine who found Christ four months ago but has already tweeted photos of himself in his tighty-whities baptizing some poor sap? Well, kids, gather around the fireplace and hear a story as old as time. In surely a case of coincidental timing, Brand converted to Christianity just six months after The Sunday Times of London and Channel 4 published allegations that Brand had sexually assaulted multiple women between 2006 and 2013. (Brand told the paper that the relationships were consensual.) Brand was already Joe Rogan-curious, but now he's gone full John the Batshit. \"I have arrived on this stage via Hollywood, via liberalism, via all sorts of images of freedom in the form of decadence and Epicureanism, the mindless pursuit of pleasure as a god,\" says Brand, sounding very much like his character from Get Him to the Greek if he had been involved in a terrible motorcycle accident. \"But I stand before you today, thankfully with a professional psychologist, because I could go crazy at any moment, baby.\" Peterson looks tired, maybe because this is his third stage appearance, including a 20-minute lecture about writing your own story rather than accepting the Big State's narrative. (A monetizing opportunity has been lost if this is not already a class at Bari Weiss University.) The two foreign nationals have a conversation of sorts about why America is the last bulwark against the fall of Western civilization. \"I made an allusion this morning to the fact that we're trying to get our story straight,\" says Peterson without a touch of irony. \"We're trying to understand what is the foundation on which we all stand that allows us to maintain the freedoms that ennoble us and give us an unlimited horizon of opportunity. What are they in the United States? How are they related to, let's say, the Judeo-Christian enterprise as a whole, and what is it to bring us together as avatars of the freedom-loving democracies across the world?\" I will buy you a burrito if you can parse that sentence. Brand thinks he knows what has befallen America. \"One thing that struck me, Dr. Peterson, is the banalization of our culture,\" says Brand, who began his career as an MTV presenter in the U.K. and once hosted Big Brother's Big Mouth, a Big Brother offshoot. \"That means making it ordinary and sterile and lacking in glory and lacking in valor, the desacralization. That means the taking away of God from all things. It seems that there is a globalist and totalitarian scheme to replace God.\" It is hard to artfully summarize someone who speaks like an AI version of the biggest dipshit you knew at art school, but here we are. Brand moves into fire-and-brimstone talk delivered in a twee accent. \"I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning; the principle of separateness, the principle of self-centeredness, the principle of the principle of solipsism, upon which this great culture is being steered towards, not community and congregation.\" Friends, sit up straight and listen when Russell Brand talks of solipsism. Dude knows of what he speaks. The crowd titters. Maybe we are entering some kind of Joaquin Phoenix I'm Still Here stunt and Brand is filming a mockumentary. Perhaps sensing this, Brand heads back to simple bangers-and-mash conspiracy talk. \"Note that George Soros just bought 300 radio stations,\" says Brand. \"You'll know that Bill Gates invested $300 million in media donations in the last few years. It's centralized control.\" I want to shout \"What about Elon Musk buying Twitter,\" but the crowd is in full Give Us Barabbas! mode. Brand then asks if he can end their talk with a prayer. \"Christ, I call upon your name on this occasion.... May these institutions that were once regarded sacred, so sacred, in fact, that any incursion upon them as on January 6 was regarded as a kind of heresy. May the values that warrant these buildings, these institutions that flag this nation being regarded as one nation under God return to the forefront. May I pray, Lord Jesus Christ, in your holy name, that all Americans, of all cultures and colors and persuasions, come together in your name. I ask Heavenly Father for a new era of peace, that Satan be cast out in your name, in all his forms, but in particular the bizarre Kafka-esque, Hitler-esque, late-Orwellian form of totalitarianism, bureaucracy in the name of care.\" Somehow, there's more. \"Lord, I ask for true republicanism and true democracy, that every individual may feel their freedom, their freedom to engage in discourse and conversation with one another in good faith, and an end to the deception, the lies and the censorship.\" The Joker and Charlatan U.K. then recite the Lord's Prayer. Now, I've seen many things in my 143 years of reporting, but this is a true WTF moment. Not even televangelists have the balls to offer pseudo-intellectual political commentary embedded within an actual prayer. Then, former 60 Minutes correspondent turned cray cray impresario Lara Logan emerges from the wings. She self-introduces herself as one of the world's last real reporters. And that's when I realize God has taken his own life. \"BOBBY! BOBBY! BOBBY!\" The chants continue as Kennedy takes his place behind a podium protected by bulletproof glass. Clad in a blue suit, white shirt, and tie, RFK Jr. hears the words previously reserved for his father when he was just a boy. What human would not love that? But his own words bear little resemblance to anything his father or uncle would have ever said. The central premise of any RFK Jr. speech is the fusion of vaccine bullshit -- he never mentions the dozens of Samoans who died from the measles shortly after Kennedy stopped by the island to speak against vaccines -- and the fervent belief that freedom of speech in America is on life support because he and his followers have been silenced by a conspiracy between media conglomerates and the government. \"Louis Brandeis said that the remedy for bad speech is not censorship,\" says Kennedy. \"It's never censorship, it's more speech.... Hillary Clinton, Tim Walz, and Kamala Harris all said the same thing. They said if the Democrats get back into office, that they are going to make sure that misinformation and disinformation is censored.\" No one thinks this will happen. The proof? RFK Jr. is reciting multiple disproved theories, and he is speaking into a microphone that seemingly can be heard from the Capitol to Arlington Cemetery. No independent presidential candidate, brain worm or not , has been more exhaustively covered than RFK Jr. Kennedy spends some time on the need to get chemicals and plastics out of our foods, an admirable goal if it wasn't covered with so much insanity, like a grass-fed steak drenched in ketchup. Kennedy then moves into the territory where rational people do not dare go. Not only was Covid-19 a governmental failure, it was also a government conspiracy. \"What was the point of it all?\" asks Kennedy. \"Well, look at what the outcome was. They closed all the small businesses in this country, 41 percent of Black-owned businesses will never reopen. They shifted money upward. They strengthened Big Tech institutions like Amazon and Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and Google, and they weakened Main Street and small business and the American worker. And they shifted $4.3 trillion from the American middle class to this new oligarchy of billionaires.\" I try to fact check the $4.3 trillion figure, and, as far as I can tell, this is the amount of federal aid given to individuals and businesses so they could survive the pandemic. Facebook sucks, but I'm pretty sure that a trillion dollars did not end up in Mark Zuckerberg's Venmo account. Kennedy wraps up his speech with deep-throated support of Trump, his new master. \"Do you want a president who's going to make America healthy again, and who's going to make America free again, and is going to make America once again the greatest nation and the moral authority around the globe?\" asks Kennedy. \"You need to go to the polls and get your friends there and get Donald Trump and me into Washington, D.C.\" I check my phone. RFK Jr. has not been added to the ticket. Almost simultaneously, Trump is speaking in Erie, Pennsylvania. He suggests a Purge -like period that will end violent crime in America. It doesn't reflect much respect for the Bill of Rights or making America healthy again, the twin pillars of RFK Jr.'s political ideology. \"Now, if you had one really violent day,\" says Trump . \"One rough hour, and I mean real rough, the word will get out and it [crime] will end immediately.\" I make my way to the media tent where FitzGibbons promised that RFK Jr. would speak after his speech. It's a chaotic Babylon of broken people, podcasters, and Tim Pool. I wait for a half hour, passing the time by arguing with Col. Douglas Macgregor over why he has predicted Ukraine's collapse daily since the first night of Russia's invasion. (The colonel says his mistake, and I'm paraphrasing, was he thought Vladimir Putin was going to be more ruthless.) Eventually, I text FitzGibbons to ask him when RFK Jr. might appear. \"He's not. So sorry.\" A little later, RFK Jr. and Brand are spotted coming out of the Capitol Hill office of Gavin de Becker, security consultant to the stars. A reporter shouts out a question about Bobby's involvement with New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi. He doesn't answer. On the stage, Lara Logan reappears. Logan began her career as a war correspondent, but her recent career trajectory has been shaped by insisting that Anthony Fauci is the new Josef Mengele. She has also suggested that the Rothschild family was responsible for the assassinations of JFK and, heavy sigh, Abraham Lincoln. Logan has been on my mind lately because on Friday night I ate a delicious pizza at D.C.'s Comet Pizza, the center of a bullshit 2016 child-trafficking conspiracy that ended up with an AR-15-wielding man showing up to \"liberate\" kids. The former 60 Minutes correspondent apparently didn't get the memo from eight years ago about it not being true, because in February she introduced one of the Pizzagate super-spreaders with the observation , \"It was years before I realized and started to investigate, and discovered -- holy guacamole! -- this actually is all true.\" More like holy fuck. The crowd of a few thousand is thinning, those leaving will miss Pizzagate enthusiast Jack Posobiec bringing out his six-year-old son and handing him the mic so he can yell \"Free Steve Bannon.\" Logan senses a loss of momentum so she turns up the volume. \"I just want to say, if there are any journalists here today who are going to write that this is a far-right gathering, that anyone here is ultra-right, that anyone here's a conspiracy theorist, I don't know, excuse my French, but you can go fuck yourselves.\" Lara, right back at you.\n"

      "In 2013, I met a 12-year-old Syrian girl who had been shot in the back by a government sniper near Aleppo. Her name was Maysaa, and she was paralyzed from the waist down. \"Am I a terrorist? Are all of the children they kill terrorists?\" she asked, recuperating in an improvised medical facility on her way to a Turkish hospital. Despite her pain, she was overcome with anger, and she cursed the man responsible. \"Children are being torn to pieces. May God tear Bashar al-Assad and his children to pieces.\" Curses like Maysaa's are seeds that took root in Syria 's blood-soaked soil and have stubbornly grown. Now, more than a decade later, they are bearing fruit. The murderous tyrant who presided over the collapse of Syria, amid a brutal civil war, has finally fallen. Assad's regime, responsible for more than 617,000 deaths, has evaporated in the face of an onslaught that began with a ferocious offensive by rebels in the northwest, and which was soon joined by anti-government fighters from every corner of the country. The end came quickly, in little more than 10 days. But the revolution in Syria against a regime that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered tens of thousands of its own citizens has been raging for nearly 14 years. The paroxysms of pain caused by the war in Syria have wracked the globe. It became an epicenter of chaos that tore apart the Middle East and changed the face of Europe. Millions fled into exile, abandoning their homes in a quest for safety for themselves and their children. The conflict unleashed ghastly atrocities, from nerve-agent attacks carried out by Assad's forces that killed hundreds; to the routine bombing of hospitals by Russian and Syrian aircraft; to the spread of the Islamic State, which exported its own brand of terror around the world. Through it all, Bashar al-Assad ruled, stubbornly clinging to power through brute force no matter the cost to his people. He remains wanted for war crimes. Assad was nearly toppled, until he was shored up by a foreign intervention in 2015 that came in the form of Russian bomber aircraft and Iranian mercenaries. Those who took up arms to defy him have carried on the struggle through long years of despair, dissension, and indifference. When he became president in 2000, the son of Syrian despot Hafez al-Assad was praised as a potential reformer of the totalitarian state he inherited. His father had built a potent machine of oppression, using the Ba'ath Party -- an anti-imperialist pan-Arab nationalist movement that seized power in 1963 -- as a vehicle to ascend to power over the military and intelligence services, which he used to neutralize dissent and cement his rule. When Hafez al-Assad died, Bashar became president. Hopes were high that change would come to Syria with a leader from a new generation. A brief period of liberalization, which came to be known as the Damascus Spring, encouraged many Syrians as some political prisoners were freed and a crackdown on government corruption began. But any hope that Assad, who had trained as a medical doctor and had lived in London for years working as an ophthalmologist, would usher in a new Syria was swiftly dashed. The regime's feared internal security and intelligence agency, the Mukhabarat, reasserted the grip of the authoritarian inner circle, rounding up intellectuals and dissidents. Damascus Spring turned into Syria's winter, until 2011. Widespread civil unrest erupting across the region from a confluence of economic, ideological and social factors were soon dubbed the Arab Spring; Syria was not immune. A steady drumbeat of isolated protests became a movement in March, as Syrians took to the streets demanding democratic reform and the release of political prisoners. Mass protests and uprisings spread, starting a cycle of protest-and-crackdown that led to ever-increasing numbers of slain protesters. Assad made no meaningful effort to address the widespread discontent that had started the uprising, choosing instead to blame \"foreign powers\" for fomenting unrest, and unleashing the security forces and military against his people. The country exploded into violence. By the summer, the protest movement had become an insurgency. Large numbers of soldiers were defecting and joining the protesters, and then organizing into armed militias. Protest became revolution, and descended into civil war. Tens of thousands were killed in fighting and indiscriminate shelling, while efforts to round up dissidents and critics of the regime went into hyperdrive. Hundreds of Syrians had long disappeared into the regime's prisons, where they were raped, abused, tortured, and murdered. Now they did so in the thousands. The worst crimes and abuses committed by the regime have been documented in voluminous detail by human rights groups and international prosecutors. The broken bodies of the slain were thrown into mass graves, while many families were left without any clue as to the fate of their loved ones. Under Assad, people simply disappeared. The fractious rebel alliance formed the Free Syrian Army in July 2011, but the reality was that most of the anti-regime units could do little more than conduct insurgency operations, or hold defensive positions. Many were katiba -- an Arabic word approximating \"battalion\" -- relatively small groups of defectors and amateur soldiers organized around charismatic leaders or local strongmen. Coordinating their activities was challenging. Assad's forces recognized no rules of war as they tried to crush the rebels, targeting noncombatants and even children with high explosives, sniper rifles, and machine guns. In 2013, they started using chemical weapons. A government unit in Damascus fired artillery rockets containing the nerve agent sarin against a neighborhood in the hands of the rebels. Estimates of the number killed range from 500 to more than 1,700. The scenes of men, women, and children choking to death -- of entire families turned into piles of corpses as they huddled in the corners of basements to escape the shelling -- shocked the world. Then-President Barack Obama declared that the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons had crossed a \"red line,\" and vowed to take action. In reality, Obama's response was tepid. The U.S. fired long-range cruise missiles against a handful of military targets, while the White House secured a promise from Assad not to do it again. Damascus agreed to let an international organization oversee the destruction of chemical weapons stock and dismantle production facilities. But the U.S. and the West had shown their impotence, lacking the will to meaningfully support the Syrian rebels amid accusations of warmongering that grew in the shadow of the WMD lies that had led to the disastrous invasion of Iraq. The West wrung its hands over what to do, going back-and-forth for years over whether to support the revolution, and who to train and arm if it did so. Secular rebels -- the \"moderate\" opposition preferred by Western leaders who parachuted in and toured refugee camps along the Turkish border, or met with opposition leaders with little real influence -- struggled to assemble an effective fighting force amid vague visions of a democratic Syria and sporadic supplies of weaponry from abroad. But conflicts inevitably create power vacuums, and something always fills a vacuum. Insurgents and jihadis who had fought against American occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan flooded into Syria, sensing opportunity. The jihadis had a clear idea of what they wanted and how to achieve it. Armed with Gulf Arab cash and Salafi extremism, the worst of the lot swept aside its opponents and flooded across the country. They declared the establishment of the Islamic State in 2014. The same year, Russia -- convinced by Western weakness, alarmed by Ukraine's lurch toward Europe -- annexed Crimea and sent its proxies into Donbas. The next year, it sent its forces to Syria to prop up Assad, joining the Iranians, who needed Syria as a bridge to funnel arms, training, and equipment to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria became a cauldron of violence. American warplanes were bombing the Islamic State in the east. Russian warplanes were bombing the Islamic State and rebels in the northwest. The Turks were bombing the Kurds in the north. Iranian proxies fought the Islamic State and rebels in the east, occupying key towns along the Euphrates River corridor. Millions fled renewed fighting. On Sept. 2, 2015, the body of 2-year-old Alan Shemu -- widely named as Aylan Kurdi in initial news reports -- washed ashore in Bodrum, Turkey . His family paid human traffickers nearly $6,000 to board a rubber dinghy to escape to Greece, and the overloaded boat capsized at sea. Photos of the lifeless toddler spread across the world, a heartbreaking exclamation point reminding the civilized world it had failed the people of Syria. The millions of people making their way out of Syria joined throngs of refugees from other conflicts and economic migrants trying to get into Europe, and the political consequences were seismic. Amid fear of terror attacks from the Islamic State and nativist fear-mongering about alien hordes, there came a surge of anti-Muslim bigotry as far-right, anti-immigrant political movements grew in popularity. On June 23, 2016, standing outside the Houses of Parliament in London, I watched as the Brexit referendum results came in, affirming that the U.K. would leave the European Union. Many Brits felt they were losing their country, and they wanted to do something about it. I wondered the degree to which fears about migrants and terrorism created by the war in Syria had played a role. Less than a month later, the morning after Bastille Day, July 14, I stood on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, looking at a still-wet bloodstain on the asphalt, that marked where a child had died -- one among 86 people who had been run down by a madman in a truck, inspired by the Islamic State. I thought again of Syria. I had been in Brussels in March earlier in the year, when the airport was bombed; I had been in Paris the November before that when people were gunned down drinking at cafes or listening to a heavy metal concert in the Bataclan. Both attacks had been the Islamic State. It all went back to Syria. Around the same time as the attack in Nice in July 2016, rebel forces in Aleppo -- Syria's second largest city -- had been cut off by Assad's forces. The Russian air force was pounding the rebels. I spoke to people in the besieged city regularly -- rebel fighters, aid workers, and doctors. In September, I spoke with a nurse who went by Umm Mohammed, an honorific pseudonym, while investigating the use of cluster munitions by the Russians. The maternity ward she worked in had just been bombed. \"I didn't know what to do with the children in the incubators,\" she said, so she grabbed them two by two, using a small penlight to navigate the rubble and carry them to safety with the help of another nurse. \"These kids are innocent, and they came into this world under very difficult circumstances. They came into this world during a war.\" Few choose to live amid war. But when it comes, it is always the innocent who suffer the most. By December 2016, Aleppo had fallen to Assad's regime. More than 30,000 people died before it was taken, two-thirds of them civilians. As war raged across Syria, the Kurds sought to forge their own enclave, along the lines of Kurdistan in Iraq. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were instrumental in defeating the Islamic State; now the SDF provided the firepower to maintain a multi-ethnic autonomous region home to Kurds, Syrian Arabs, Turkmen, Circassians, and Yazidis, among other ethnic groups, free from Assad's rule. The success of the revolutionary Kurdish project in Syria, known as Rojava, drew the ire of the Turks, long wary of Turkey's own Kurdish independence movement. Turkey, with its well-equipped military, had taken to intervening in the north of Syria with regular incursions when it felt its interests demanded action. In 2019, Turkey secured a promise from President Donald Trump to withdraw support for the SDF while Turkish-backed militias created a buffer zone separating the Kurds in Syria from those in Turkey. In Mardin, overlooking the Tigris and Upper Mesopotamia, I listened to Kurdish refugees sing songs of freedom and loss as their misty dreams of a transnational homeland were dispelled in the thunder and fire of Turkish artillery, and they were cut off from their homes in Syria. In 2022, when war came to Ukraine, I was there, too. I went to the front with elite Ukrainian Marines and airborne infantry, and with civilians who knew nothing of soldiering but volunteered to bear the burden of arms to defend their homes. I saw Russian fighter-bomber aircraft, and knew many of them were being piloted by the same men who had bombed hospitals in Aleppo. Little did anyone know at the outset of that invasion, Ukraine's dogged resistance would sap the strength of Russia's military machine. When Syrian rebels made their move starting last week, Moscow lacked the resources to send an expeditionary force to rescue Assad. Tehran, too, had seen its fortunes shift: its main proxy supporting the regime in Syria, Hezbollah, was decapitated by Israel after throwing in its lot with Hamas, after the surprise attack on Israel of Oct. 7, 2023. When contemplating current events, it can never be quite correct to say: \"It all started here.\" Everything that happens is a knot of the overlapping skeins that weave the pattern of history, and each individual thread can be traced back for generations, until we're all sitting around arguing about the choices made by people who went to dust 1,000 years ago. We live in the now, and Syria is a nexus for our times. Syria's civil war is an intricate web of violence, inhumanity, and unfulfilled dreams -- whose pattern became the shape of modernity. Bashar al-Assad and the decisions he made have been at the center of that web, and it has touched the lives of millions. A Syrian friend who has been living in London returned to Damascus a few weeks ago, on her first visit to family in years. She was there when the offensive led by the militant Islamist group Hayat Tahrir ash-Sham (HTS) began. She changed her flight to leave earlier than originally planned, and tried to get out on Friday, but it was too late. She's stuck there now, hoping for the best. There have been millions of Syrian stories like hers over the long years of war -- of people compelled to make compromises; of being forced to abandon families and possessions; of getting trapped as a cyclone of violence descends. My colleague Anthony Shadid was a correspondent for The New York Times who died covering the war in Syria in 2012. The last time I saw him in person was as he visited the newsroom in New York with his son in his arms. He wrote once: \"Cultures that may seem as durable as stone can break like glass, leaving all the things that held them together unattended. I believe that the craftsman, the artist, the cook, and the silversmith are peacemakers. They instill grace; they lull the world to calm.\" No one can say what the future holds for Syria. Russia, the U.S., Turkey, and Iran all have a presence there. Every one of Syria's neighbors will try to shape its future to their liking; every outside power will say it knows best what Syrians should do as they untangle 50 years of dictatorship. The myriad rebel groups that overthrew Assad represent a dizzying array of ideologies, religious sects, and ethnicities -- Sunni Islamists, Kurdish separatists, Druze militias, Shia defectors. The group that led the charge which finally brought the dictator down, HTS, has a vision for Syria under sharia law. Its leader presents himself as a reformed jihadist, willing to accommodate Syria's polyethnic, multi-religious reality. The dissident writer Yassin al-Haj Saleh -- hated by the regime and jihadis alike -- writes that the group's \"worldview is hostile to modernity and its values.\" But he isn't giving up. As thousands of prisoners are freed from Syria's prisons, some for the first time in decades, and statues and photos of the dictator are torn down, there is cause for celebration, and hope. \"Jihadists can't be countered with despair, liberal critique, or secular sloganeering. We need a strong social and political coalition mobilizing across society,\" al-Haj Saleh says. \"Millions of politically active Syrians are the best safeguard against any extremist hijacking of the revolution.\" Syria will need its peacemakers now. It will need those who instill grace and lull the world to calm. The only thing uniting Syria's opposition forces over the past 10 days as they have taken the country has been hatred of Assad and his vile regime. And now he's gone.\n"

      "The wildfires in Los Angeles are devastating. Forty thousand acres of natural and urban land have been scorched, more than 12,300 structures decimated, and tens of thousands of families lost their homes, pets, baby books, and most cherished possessions. The displaced are now fanning out, seeking temporary shelter with friends and family, in hotels, or in rental units. Many will have trouble finding a place to stay in a city that was already as many as 450,000 affordable units short before the fires. When there are more heads than beds, it's a seller's market. When there are more heads than beds in a crisis, it's a gouger's market. Cue the greedy landlords. In the past week, the price of rental units has skyrocketed. Tenants are inundating government and non-government agencies with complaints of price gouging, according to the Housing Rights Center . A review of Zillow listings by The New York Times found that rent prices in West Los Angeles have spiked from 15 percent to an \"eye-popping 64 percent.\" And residents have begun cataloging an ever-growing list of inexplicably large price spikes in a jaw-dropping Google Sheet , a veritable rogue's gallery of tenant exploitation, broken down by street address. According to the list, a one bedroom townhome outside Jefferson Park jumped from $900 to $2,300 . Another in downtown Los Angeles (one of the few listings that does allow pets) spiked from $1,095 to $3,200 . A five-bed, five-bath near Brentwood Heights went from $12,000 to $15,000. When asked about the shocking rent hikes, an L.A.-area listing agent offered the most-commonly invoked defense of price gouging: it was just \" supply and demand \" at work. Unfortunately, this type of price gouging after natural disasters is all too common. Early in the pandemic, price gouging on masks, hand sanitizer, respirators, and clorox wipes was rampant. After Hurricane Harvey, the Texas attorney general reported an instance of gougers charging a whopping $99 for a case of water . This is why the majority of states -- including California -- have price gouging laws on the books. These laws are designed to protect consumers when the markets may be impacted by natural disasters, pandemics, or other disruptions, like supply chain shocks -- but they are only as good as their enforcers. Area residents are reporting price hikes that far exceed California's 10-percent threshold for price gouging. Lawmakers must work quickly to crack down on these predators, and make an example of some of the worst offenders. It is good to see that California Governor Gavin Newsom has extended price - gouging protections for rental housing through March, and that California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced his office will be ramping up resources to investigate and prosecute offenders. Even if they act fast, it won't be enough. Because the problem is bigger than the greedy landlords. The private equity vultures have also descended on the Hollywood Hills, and begun sifting through the rubble, looking to see what they might be able to acquire in a fire sale. Real estate agents are calling for the city to suspend its new \" mansion tax ,\" which applies to deals over $5 million, and last year raised $375 million for affordable housing -- a duck call for investors and corporate landlords looking to expand their footprint in the rental market. In a letter , realtors argued, \"Exempting developers from the transfer tax for five years will encourage them to purchase land from homeowners at reasonable prices and quickly rebuild these devastated communities.\" Suspending the mansion tax will starve the city of the resources it needs to rebuild the affordable housing units displaced families require. It is the opposite of what policymakers should do to meet this moment. Now is the perfect time to show Angelenos why they passed this legislation in the first place, using the proceeds to deliver affordable housing on an expedited timeline that matches the urgency of this crisis. Lawmakers can look to the recent successes of Executive Directive 1, which streamlined some permitting for affordable units, as a roadmap. And while residents wait for additional housing to come online, policymakers should extend price gouging protections to renters through at least the end of 2025, and prohibit application fees, credit check fees, and other junk fees that drive up the total cost of rent during this period as well. Crises like natural disasters expose and widen the existing fault lines in our economy and our public policy. Rent gouging after a wildfire is galling, but the hard truth is that every day, across this country, tenants are exploited by a housing system that is failing them. Even before the wildfires, our country was facing a severe housing affordability crisis, driven in part by corporate landlords working to extract as much as they can from us and our neighbors. The lack of affordable housing across the country, and in major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles in particular, leaves us vulnerable to the whims of landlords. Private equity's deepening penetration into the residential real estate market only exacerbates this power imbalance. This dynamic shows no sign of abating as President Trump's new nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development extolled the virtues of private equity at his confirmation hearing this week. If we want to stop the vultures from circling, we must build a housing system that can not only withstand dangerous weather, but also the dangers of an economy that makes a fair price for rent increasingly elusive.

      "We dodged a bullet with the Supreme Court this term. Literally. Last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decided that domestic abusers subject to qualifying protective orders must be allowed to purchase and carry firearms. You read that right. In U.S. v. Rahimi, the court ruled that the Constitution requires that abusers who have already been deemed a threat be permitted to buy and carry a gun if they so choose. The Supreme Court reversed that dangerous decision last week and ruled that the government can, in fact, prohibit abusers from carrying guns, just as it has done for decades. That's a relief. But the fact that Rahimi even made it this far is a failure. There never should have been a question as to whether the government could validly prevent domestic violence abusers from possessing firearms while under a protective order. When abusers are armed, they're five times more likely to kill their victims, and for that reason, these laws have been on the books for decades. It was the Supreme Court's erroneous, nonsensical, and flat-out dangerous decision last year in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen caused this farce -- and continues to threaten gun laws that are the bedrock of public safety. Using an absurd reading of \"originalism,\" the Court in Bruen undid over a century of precedent and rewrote the constitutional test under which the 2nd Amendment must now be read by the courts. A favorite of conservative jurists, originalism dictates that for a law to be constitutional, it must comport with a literal reading of the Constitution as it was understood 250 years ago, when the Constitution was written. But the Supreme Court's decision in Bruen stretches that standard to its logical extreme to say that for a gun law to be constitutional, there must be a similar such law on the books in the historical record. This is a dangerous legal standard, and one ripe for abuse. Rahimi shows us why. In a ruling littered with logical inconsistencies, cherry-picked facts, and historical inaccuracies, the Fifth Circuit used the Bruen test to rule that Zackey Rahimi, a man who was involved in multiple shootings after being placed under a domestic violence protective order for alleged assault against his ex-girlfriend, should be allowed to carry a gun because there was no founding-era law that prohibited abusers from owning firearms. This gets at the fundamental flaw in Bruen, and the danger to us all. The Fifth Circuit is right in that there was no identical law at our nation's founding, because domestic violence was not outlawed and women had few rights or protections. In fact, beating your wife was legal in many states until far into the 20th Century. Marital rape was only outlawed throughout the entire United States in 1945. But even though domestic abuse is abhorrent and repugnant to us as a society now, Bruen does not care for such niceties. It cares only about whether or not the laws of today parallel the laws of an era when white men could own slaves and it was legal to beat women. The Second Amendment is practically the only constitutional right subject to this absurd reading of the law, where courts must weigh the assault rifles of today against the muskets of the past. Life today is vastly different than it was 200 years ago, and so are our laws. In the intervening years, Black men obtained the right to vote (1870), as did white women (1920), Asian Americans (1952), and Native Americans (1957). Even so, often insurmountable barriers existed to voting -- especially for Black people -- until the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Further, our gun violence epidemic and incredibly high death rate did not exist 200 years ago. Over 40,000 Americans are dying from gun violence every year. That would have been unheard of in 1791, when guns held only one round at a time. To subject an imperfect but vastly more equal modern world today to the laws of a world where slavery was legal, people had no electricity and penicillin hadn't yet been invented is an absolute farce. And as Rahimi demonstrates, this test threatens to puncture vast holes in the already fragile system of gun safety. While the court undid this profound failure in Rahimi to once again protect victims of domestic abuse, and loosened the Bruen test slightly, Bruen stands largely intact and its dangerous logic looms large. Numerous other gun safety laws -- critical tools to keep already sky-high gun death rates from shooting even higher -- are at risk. Litigious gun advocacy groups are using Bruen as a basis to challenge common-sense gun safety laws across the country, from assault weapons bans, ghost gun regulations, minimum age requirements, and even laws that keep firearms out of sensitive spaces such as schools, parks, and libraries. The Supreme Court has much more work to do, we hope, to clarify its logic in Bruen and undo some of the most harmful pieces of that decision. Because as long as Bruen stands as is, gun safety laws in America remain on unsteady ground, and what few tools we do have to protect our communities and our children from gun violence will remain threatened. As long as gun violence runs rampant, blood will be on the Supreme Court's hands. Ciara Malone is the legal director at March For Our Lives.\n"

      "\"This was my dream job and it's just being taken away by an administration who doesn't care about science,\" cried a scientist we'll call Alexis, in a video viewed over 1.2 million times, her voice breaking and tears running down her face. \"They don't care about our species that we're trying to conserve. We should all be so mad right now. We should all be crying like this.\" The latest wave of mass firings in the federal government has washed over thousands of workers , Including those in the National Institute of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Forest Service. Elon Musk -- an unelected official, the richest man in the world, and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- slashed the jobs of 200,000 federal workers as part of his \"cost-cutting initiative.\" The workers targeted were those in a probationary period , who are generally newer hires who have been in their current positions for less than a year. Fired federal workers have taken to TikTok to share their experiences and explain just what the end of their programs and research means for the American public. Alexis, a physical scientist in the Department of the Interior, tells Rolling Stone that she loves her job, which contributes to the recovery of species impacted by the building of the Hoover and Davis Dams. \"I'm not doing this for the money,\" she said. \"I'm doing it because I love it. It is so rewarding to be able to help these species with data and technology.\" Alexis already lives paycheck to paycheck -- when her firing becomes official, she may have to leave the state she lives in to move in with family. \"I'm not going to be okay,\" she said. \"Those tears [in the video] was me coming to the realization that our government is not being controlled by people who care about us and know what we do.\" It's frustrating to Alexis that Elon Musk's tactic for cutting government spending is not to tax the uber-wealthy but instead to fire federal workers who keep the government and its programs running. \"They're like, 'Let's cancel and freeze all the other contracts, but not the ones for Elon Musk's companies .'\" And it's more than that - Alexis worries about the environmental effects of halting her work. \"There are entire species that will go extinct without our continued, informed interventions when developing and monitoring native land cover.\" At the National Institute of Health, Amber, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy, worked in the Office of AIDS Research. There's a fundamental misunderstanding about AIDS in the United States, Amber says -- the reason that infection rates are so low is because there is federal money going toward treatment and research. \"If the funds are not going to the right place, if the right people are not getting the care that they need, HIV is something that could spread so easily,\" she says. In a TikTok video, Amber explained her position, the process of termination, and why she thinks Americans should be worried. \"These are public workers who are trying to bring healthcare to the American people and protect the American people,\" she said. In the comments of her TikTok video, people urge her to hire an attorney to fight the firing. \"With what money? I don't have a job anymore.\" Amber and her fiance were planning on getting married in 2026 but the firing has changed their plans. The couple is going to have a civil ceremony next month so that Amber can get on her future husband's health insurance. She worries, too, about paying rent without her income. But the thing she worries about the most is the people who were served by the programs she helped run. \"I'm worried about the people that my team serves who have HIV and are homeless,\" she said. \"It's people like that that I'm more worried about than myself. Truthfully, I know I'll be fine.\" As a management and program analyst at the Department of Health and Human Services, Victoria, who posted a video viewed 1.1 million times in which she did her makeup and calmly explained her firing, worked within a division which ensured compliance and standards for testing labs. Without their work, labs could experience more testing errors, like telling a patient they're not sick with a virus when they actually are. The point of making the video was to help people understand the real human impact of these mass firings. \"I just want people across the country to know what is going on,\" Victoria tells Rolling Stone . \"There's federal workers all over the country, giving services that people don't even realize are federal services.\" Though the response to Victoria's TikTok was largely positive, with commenters wishing her luck and denouncing the firings, there were naysayers. \"There have been some negative comments of people saying that federal workers are lazy and don't do anything and, 'Good, now you can go get a real job.' I don't even really know what that means because these are some of the realest jobs across the country.\" Victoria points to the layoffs at the Federal Aviation Administration , which come amidst heightened travel anxiety after recent plane crashes , or the researchers who were looking into bird flu, which is contributing to high egg prices. \"People really don't understand the extent to which federal services are offered in this country and how many people it really takes to operate those services.\" Amber puts it even more starkly: \"You never hear about these federal employees, because they do their job well.\"\n",

      "In 2022, President Joe Biden stood at a crossroads. His party had just shattered midterm expectations -- the strongest showing for a first-term president in decades. It was a triumphant moment that came with a choice: step aside in victory or tempt fate for four more years. A graceful exit then would have allowed an open primary, giving presidential hopefuls time to make their case to voters. He chose wrong. After delivering a devastating debate performance, the rapidly diminishing 81-year-old president was still convinced that he, and precisely no one else, could save America. This astonishing Buchananesque approach -- declare yourself the only solution while actively making the problem worse -- inspired unprecedented reactions: House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi emerged from retirement to pressure a transition. Democrats increasingly broke their silence. And this presidential historian found herself writing the hardest essay of her career: I called for an ostensibly successful, unindicted president to resign in these pages . I calibrated my appeal to his outsized ego -- a trait he shares with the 44 men who preceded him. My focus wasn't saving democracy -- though that would be a welcome bonus -- but to what the archives have taught me commanders-in-chief hold most dear: their place in presidential history. I celebrated his truly FDR-scale achievements while offering a dignity-preserving escape plan wrapped in historical glory: by listening to the electorate's concerns and elevating the first woman president, he could join George Washington in democracy's most exclusive club -- one Donald Trump will never be accepted into -- those rare leaders who chose to walk away from power. My legacy-saving solution was simple: One needn't be a presidential historian to see impending disasters everywhere. He ignored them all. The most unsubtle red flags: Two days after my essay was published, Biden announced he would indeed step aside -- and a hurried coronation would follow. In that moment, he did to his legacy what Charles Guiteau did to James A. Garfield in that fateful July of 1881: inflicted a mortal wound that would take a few months to kill. Yes, Biden stepped aside -- but with a poisoned chalice in hand, giving Harris merely two months to defend his indefensible position on Gaza while he periodically emerged from Delaware to kneecap her. Biden could have been his legacy's savior; instead, he chose to become its executioner, surrounded by a Greek chorus of enablers who hummed approval as he sharpened the blade. When future historians chronicle his presidency, his pathological grip on power will eclipse everything else -- a tragedy Shakespeare himself might have deemed too obvious in its hubris. His truly spectacular list of accomplishments will serve merely as dramatic irony, a glittering prelude to catastrophe. The C-SPAN presidential survey -- where 142 historians score each president from 1 to 10 on leadership qualities -- looms like an approaching executioner, ready to bury Biden's legacy alive. In 2021, Trump was fourth from the bottom. Biden may now rank toward the middle tier, but that's quicksand territory that few escape. I think it's more than likely he'll soon join history's basement dwellers: James Buchanan (watched the Union crumble with the passive interest of a theater critic), Herbert Hoover (conducted the economy's funeral march), and Trump, who at least never posed as democracy's champion while suffocating it. Biden will be the only resident of this dark basement with genuine achievements worth eulogizing: He remains the only presidential candidate to defeat Trump. The $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (at last, bridges that don't threaten suicide), the CHIPS Act (America flexing its technological biceps at China), and the first meaningful climate legislation since humans discovered they could wound the atmosphere. He conjured 3.1 percent GDP growth from economists' doom prophecies. His unemployment numbers made statisticians blush. NATO expanded like a European block party with an open bar. He restored America to something resembling sanity. And, of course, he can be credited with the first woman and first Black woman vice president. Trump can't erase Kamala Harris -- though he'll attack her at every turn -- but he will most certainly reduce most of Biden's achievements to rubble with the gleeful efficiency of a demolition crew, taking liberal democracy down with them. Some progressive policies may survive, like lower drug prices for seniors, but the most unpopular are more likely: a China strategy whose wisdom remains as murky as Beijing's air, and a morally bankrupt stance on Gaza, where Biden's response oscillated between comatose and criminal. And the nightmare compounds: The Supreme Court, already listing hard to starboard, likely faces two vacancies in the next four years. Trump will cement a judicial fortress that will overshadow not just our lifetimes, but our children's -- a death sentence for countless daughters who will bleed out in states where their grandmothers secured their right to live. Biden entered politics at 29, barely old enough to meet the Senate's constitutional threshold, and he'll exit at 82, having methodically dismantled his life's work. In the court of presidential history, the verdict will be brutal: He squandered his legacy and left democracy's door ajar for precisely what he promised to prevent. Alexis Coe is an American presidential historian, senior fellow at New America, and the author of, most recently, the New York Times best-selling You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington .\n"

      "The mass purge of federal workers under Donald Trump and Elon Musk 's so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) plan is more than just an attack on the government bureaucracy -- it's a direct assault on the veterans who make up nearly 30 percent of the federal workforce. In a decision that will be remembered as a betrayal of the veteran community and the broader federal workforce, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued an email Tuesday similar in wording to the one Musk used to gut Twitter . The message, which arrived under the subject line, \"Fork in the Road,\" presented federal employees with a false choice: agree to resign now with temporary pay or risk termination later. Musk made a similar offer to Twitter employees, along with promises about severance that were apparently never honored -- a precedent that raises serious concerns about the integrity of this so-called \"deferred resignation\" plan. Musk's fingerprints on this scheme introduce major legal questions, as he is neither a government advisor nor a federal employee . This raises the alarming possibility that the offer itself may not even be legally valid, opening a new legal and constitutional battle over the authority behind this directive. The administration's forced resignation scheme, disguised as a voluntary buyout offer, is nothing more than a coercive tactic -- not an act of good faith. Federal workers, many of them veterans, are being pressured to resign by February 6 in exchange for eight months of pay. The alternative? Facing reclassification, forced return-to-office mandates, or outright termination. These threats are designed to create panic, rather than reflect actual likelihood. The most alarming part is that by the time this scheme is challenged in court, it may be too late for veterans who took the bait, leaving them without jobs, benefits, or recourse. This Trump administration threat is not about cost-cutting or making government work better. This is about power -- gutting the civil service, replacing professionals with political loyalists, if at all, and eliminating any institutional resistance to his extreme right-wing agenda. It is exactly the kind of plan you might expect to see in a Cold War report about how to take down a government without firing a shot. For veterans, the stakes are even higher. Many took federal jobs as part of their transition back into civilian life. These roles provide stability, purpose, and, for some, the only path forward after military service. Veterans work in nearly every agency, but they are particularly concentrated in Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Defense Department -- all of which are critical to national security and veteran care. By gutting these agencies, Trump and Musk aren't just purging workers; they are sabotaging the very services that support veterans and their families. The same veterans will get whacked on the back end as their care from the Department of Veterans Affairs deteriorates, if the veterans and non-veterans there fall for the scheme. And let's be clear: The math doesn't add up. Trump and Musk claim their government purge will help save $2 trillion, but the entire civilian federal payroll is only $271 billion. Even if every federal worker were fired, they wouldn't come close to those savings. What they will accomplish is chaos: longer VA wait times, weakened national security, a gutted social safety net, and a boat load of unemployed veterans with nothing but time and an axe to grind. This won't deliver efficiency -- it's destruction for the sake of destruction and a display of sheer incompetence by Musk, who couldn't even be bothered to come up with a new scheme to screw over veterans, and instead just dusted off his Twitter playbook. He assumes we're as gullible as Trump's die-hard supporters. We're not. If he and Trump don't back off, we'll make sure they hear us -- loud and clear. See the Bonus Army , when veterans marched on Washington during the Great Depression demanding the bonus payments they had been promised. As this new purge unfolds, veterans once again find themselves in the crosshairs -- not on the battlefield, but in a political war where their service is treated as disposable. Congress needs to act now, before there's nothing left to save.\n",

      "Let's say you were going to your high school prom in the spring of 1969, and you turned on the (probably AM) radio in your Mustang on the way to the school cafeteria -- the Number One song in America? Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In . Fast forward 55 years, and you're 73, right about the median age for surviving baby boomers. Which means, as we start casting votes next month, you're going to play a disproportionate role in the outcome of the coming election. That's because candidates have to work hard to lure younger voters to the polls, but not so with the old, who have the habit of democracy most strongly ingrained. There's no known way to stop old people from voting. Donald Trump might be inclined to think that's good news for him -- that as the oldest man ever to win a presidential nomination and one whose campaign is rooted in nostalgic appeals to past greatness, he should harvest most of those votes from the boomers and the Silent Generation. After all, he won those categories in 2020, though by reduced margins from 2016. But not so fast this time -- remember that tune from Hair on the radio. We're turning out more older voters all the time -- about 10,000 people a day pass the 65-year mark. And increasingly, they're starting to make that caricature -- older voters are more conservative -- irrelevant. Older voters come from the past -- but the past they come from is changing. Which means new polling indicates that something like a silver wave may be building as November approaches. Consider, for instance, the Fairleigh Dickinson poll last week that found the biggest lead yet for Kamala Harris -- a seven-point national edge that came largely from her 16-point lead among people over the age of 65. On Thursday, a Suffolk University poll for USA Today found Harris leading Trump 53-42 among voters over 60 -- her largest vote share of any demographic. And it's the same in many of the swing states: A New York Times /Siena College poll showed her with a modest lead among older voters in Arizona -- and there are a lot of older voters in Arizona. In North Carolina, another swing state crowded with retirees, she's up by 10 points among older voters. In Maine, statistically the oldest state in the union, Harris led by 20 points among older voters. In Vermont, the second-oldest state, 61 percent of older voters thought Trump's mental and physical health were \"very poor,\" higher than any other group. (Which is worth thinking about -- if anyone's an expert on gauging decline, it's those of us who see it around us regularly, and perhaps sense it in ourselves). There are enough polls out there that you can find the opposite too -- the last Washington Post poll , now almost two weeks old, shows Trump beating Harris by two points among older voters, and a Pell Center poll had him up by three . But I think it's safe to say Trump shouldn't count on older voters. At Third Act, which I founded to organize progressive voters over the age of 60, our volunteers have written hundreds of thousands of postcards to swing states, and they're phone banking every night; they report anecdotally a huge surge of interest in and support for the Harris-Walz ticket. We organized an \"Elders for Kamala\" call last month, and it blew up fast -- with Jane Fonda, Bette Midler, and Robin Wall Kimmerer all making the case that older Americans were thinking progressive. Some of this can be explained by simple self-interest. We older voters know that the last time around Trump made repeated efforts to cut Medicare and Social Security , and we paid attention earlier this year when, asked about the entitlement programs, he mused that \"there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting.\" But I think deeper cultural forces are also at play -- the muscle memory, the generational DNA, that was formed in that remarkable period of social, cultural, and political transformation that was the 1960s. It was the apex of the civil rights campaigns, the rise of the women's movement, the first Earth Day. As the political analyst Nate Cohn pointed out earlier this year, we're not Archie Bunker -- that's our dads. We're Meathead. We've lived with the freedoms of Roe v. Wade and the protections of the Clean Air Act, and it's been disconcerting to watch the Supreme Court strip them away. To the extent that we are \"conservative,\" clean air and reproductive rights are among the things we want to conserve. Older voters are second only to the youngest cohort in their share of \" climate voters,\" in part because we've lived long enough to know how drastically the climate has changed. Eighty-six percent of older Americans think abortion should be legal at least under certain circumstances -- in part because we're old enough to remember coathangers. As for democracy -- well, Jan. 6 may have hit us particularly hard, because we've lived through 15 or 20 elections, and had come to take the peaceful transfer of power entirely for granted. But it's not just the issues. To us, Trump seems ... not normal. Even those our age who support him tend to say things like, \"I like his policies, but I wish he'd shut up.\" That's because if our politics may have been formed by the liberations of the 1960s and 1970s, our attitudes probably go back deeper than that. Remember -- we were born under Truman and Eisenhower. Consider, for instance, Trump's endless insistence that everything is rigged against him. (He once claimed he would have won a Nobel Peace Prize \"for a lot of things, if they give it out fairly, which they don't.\") We may have thought our fathers too stoic and may be glad that our children are more in touch with their feelings, but we look askance at adults who consider themselves victims (perhaps especially if they're also billionaires, by the grace of their parents). Or think about Trump's disrespect for veterans. Yes, we were in the antiwar generation, but our parents fought in World War II and Korea, and even if we ended up with varying ideas about war and foreign policy, we still find it jarring to hear that Trump declined to visit a military cemetery because it was raining, or said he doesn't want wounded veterans near him in parades because they make him look bad. We all knew people who fought in Vietnam, the last conflict fought by draftees. Someone like Tim Walz -- football coach, National Guardsman -- is a familiar figure for us, even though he's barely 60. I'm not saying that older Americans will definitely vote for Harris and Walz. Trump clearly expects we won't -- and that the thought of a Black woman in the White House will be too unsettling. And truthfully, the Democrats aren't doing much outreach to older voters -- back when it was still the Biden campaign, they launched their senior outreach with \"events like bingo and pickleball,\" which may not be reading the room quite right. (Think more like Carole King, who played at the \"Swifties for Kamala\" call.) But there are signs -- even in outposts like the Villages in Florida, where golf cart parades for Harris as well as Trump now snake through the sleepy streets. Don't sleep on the elders. It's starting to look like a lot of us may back the Democrats -- if so, that silver wave could turn very blue. Bill McKibben is the founder of Third Act, which organizes people over the age of 60 for action on climate and democracy. He's also the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College.\n"

      "The murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare , America's largest health insurer, has generated a lot of discourse over the past week and renewed conversation about the state of the U.S. health care system -- something that was almost entirely missing from the 2024 campaign. Social media users have actively celebrated the shooting and thirsted over the suspect . In the other direction, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens argued the insurance exec was a \"working-class hero,\" while blogger Noah Smith asserted that health insurers are simply \"middlemen\" and not \"the main villain of the U.S. health system.\" The CEO of UnitedHealth Group (UHC's parent company) wrote in the Times that the health conglomerate's purpose is \"to build a health care system that works better for everyone.\" Sure , man . Yet, CNN offered perhaps the strangest take in one segment this week: Americans are responsible for our health care system staying the way it's designed today -- i.e. based around private health insurance -- because they like their insurance plans. On Wednesday, CNN anchor John Berman and Harry Enten, a senior political data reporter, reviewed poll results from Gallup which showed that Americans broadly have negative views about health care coverage in the U.S., believe health care costs are too high, and say the health care system has major problems. Americans, for the most part, have more favorable views of their own health care coverage -- which Berman and Enten repeatedly emphasized -- though those numbers were not resounding. \"We can't just say Americans hate health care. No, they like their health care,\" said Berman. \"They just have this notion they don't like the health care system. I suppose you can hold those two views at once, but it is complicated.\" The argument that Americans like their own health insurance plans is a favorite industry talking point. Indeed, as the internet was heralding the UnitedHealthcare CEO's murder, the health care industry's primary anti-reform front group was posting on X: \"A majority of voters nationwide are satisfied with their current health plans.\" (The corollary to this industry talking point is: And that's why nothing should ever change .) The thing is, people are typically OK with their health insurance plans until they really need to use it -- and see their claims denied, get told they can't receive a necessary treatment, or find themselves paying major out-of-pocket costs. Considering the rest of Berman's comment, the idea that Americans could like their health care and hate the system is still not necessarily a complicated view, because the U.S. health care system is uniquely expensive and wasteful. America spends far more on health care than other wealthy countries -- for exceedingly poor outcomes. Being dissatisfied with the total cost of the health care system -- as 79 percent of Americans are, per the Gallup poll -- is simply correct. Enten took things a step further: \"You wonder why the health care system in this country stays the same,\" he said. \"It's because people don't like health care, in sort of the abstract -- but when it comes to their own health care, a lot of Americans actually are pretty gosh darn satisfied with it.\" The idea that Americans are responsible for the health care system remaining the way it's designed is ludicrous. The two have nothing to do with each other. The public doesn't set policy -- and even when Americans believe they are voting for change or for a specific policy platform they were promised, they rarely get it, thanks to entrenched corporate power and rampant corruption. Donald Trump won in 2016 railing against health insurers that \"are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians.\" His first administration did nothing to address this in office, and instead encouraged more seniors to sign up for privatized Medicare Advantage plans. Joe Biden , meanwhile, campaigned in 2020 on a promise to enact a public health insurance option -- and has not even once mentioned that policy idea as president. Instead, Democrats gave more subsidies , i.e. extra money, to health insurers to help more Americans sign up for individual health insurance plans. Blaming Americans for the current system remaining in place obscures those who are actually responsible: a collection of massively lucrative businesses that profit from the current arrangement and the many politicians on both sides of the aisle who either dutifully represent their interests or are afraid to take on an industry with deep pockets -- or both. Our health care system works phenomenally well for health insurance companies, of course, and for other powerful industries: for instance, pharmaceutical companies that want to be able to keep drug prices far higher in the U.S. than in the rest of the world, or hospital chains that charge private plans much higher prices than Medicare would pay. That's why lobbies for health insurers, drug companies, and chain hospitals created a front group to oppose reform ideas like Medicare for All , the public option, and efforts to lower the Medicare eligibility age. (That front group is the one trying to tell people on X that Americans actually really like their health coverage and don't want any meaningful changes.) These lobbying groups each collect tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year, from industries that collectively generate tens or hundreds of billions in annual revenue. (To be clear, there are many other lines of business that profit off our health care system's bloat and administrative waste.) All of the money sloshing around the health care system makes it incredibly difficult to change much, if anything, about it -- because it limits any political incentive to try. Powerful health care interests shower politicians with donations, fund front groups that support them , and can spend these politicians into the ground any time, at will, if it becomes necessary. As Democrats negotiated the Affordable Care Act between 2009 and 2010, health insurance lobbyists quietly funneled more than $100 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to run a sprawling campaign slamming the legislation and its supporters. The ACA became law, but Democrats ultimately nixed the public option -- before promising that idea again in 2020 and immediately dropping it once they won. This year's election featured little conversation about potential health care reforms. When Trump was asked during a debate to describe his plans for health care, the president-elect only said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to improve the ACA. It was an embarrassing moment -- yet, a Fox News Voter Analysis found the majority of respondents who said they were very concerned about their health care costs were supporting Trump. Now, Team Trump is considering making it even harder for low-income households to access Medicaid coverage -- and using the savings to help pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. Republicans may also allow the expanded subsidies to expire , which would make it more expensive for many Americans to buy individual coverage. Americans didn't make our health care system the way it is today -- and they certainly didn't vote for Republicans to make it even worse, if that's what they end up doing. An immensely powerful health care industry and corrupt political class give Americans no choices in these matters at all.\n",

      "As Ranking Member of both the House Appropriations Committee and of the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Subcommittee, I oversee funding for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the largest department in the U.S. government. This pillar of our government administers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency that provides health coverage for nearly 160 million Americans, as well as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nation's crown jewels of biomedical research and public health. HHS is about to undergo the most sustained, withering assault we have seen in its entire existence. This attack will come from within. And it is led by a group that can aptly be described as the Four Horsemen -- war, famine, pestilence, and death. The incoming administration has declared war against the very idea of civil service, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Dr. Jay Bhattacharya , Dr. David Weldon , and Dr. Mehmet Oz are a group dispatched by President-elect Trump for a single purpose: to blow up our health system as we know it. They will orchestrate famine, starving essential programs of funding and cutting benefits for millions of Americans. They will unleash pestilence by suspending work on critical vaccines and firing the scientists hard at work finding cures to infectious diseases. And make no mistake -- Americans will die as a result, whether it is from an outbreak of preventable disease, rollbacks of insurance coverage, or the termination of lifesaving medical research. We cannot let the right claim the HHS organizations they deride as \"bureaucratic\" do not perform life-saving actions every day. Let us start with the NIH, the world's leading funder of biomedical research. It supports life-saving research on drugs and disease treatments, which has led to over 100 Nobel Prizes. It is no surprise, then, that Trump's pick wants to demolish it. RFK Jr. has claimed he will try to fire 600 NIH employees on his first day, and reallocate half of the agency's budget to \"preventative, alternative, and holistic approaches to health.\" He said, \"We're going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.\" Leaving aside the fact that the NIH already spends tens of billions of dollars annually on chronic disease research, with institutes dedicated to diabetes, obesity, neurological disorders, and heart disease -- this lurch away from ongoing research would have far-reaching consequences, pushing experienced researchers and scientists out of promising fields and creating a chilling effect for new graduates choosing their research tracks. It would amount to throwing away years of research and wasting investments that would not easily be restarted. We are on the cusp of so many breakthroughs, cures and life-sustaining therapies, and throwing that progress away is not just short-sighted, but deadly. Furthermore, chronic and infectious disease research does not occur in silos, where one can be gutted without affecting each other. Infectious disease research often yields information that helps us understand chronic conditions, and vice versa. For example, immunotherapies that are now used to treat cancer were first discovered from NIH research on infectious diseases that target the immune system. When you take a wrecking ball to one pillar, you weaken the entire building. And Trump's nominee for NIH Director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who gained fame as the author of a Covid-era manifesto that called for letting vast amounts of Americans die in order to more quickly achieve herd immunity, has indicated he will be a willing foot soldier for this plan. Bhattacharya has called for a dramatic restructuring of the agency, which he claims is led by small-minded bureaucrats. This utter mischaracterization of one of our most important research institutions should be disqualifying in itself, let alone his acquiescence to these plans for mass firings and organizational amputation. Next, let us turn to the CDC, which was created to track and respond to infectious disease outbreaks as well as prevent and reduce chronic diseases. RFK Jr. and Dr. David Weldon, Trump's pick to lead the CDC, would undermine one of the pillars of public health. When he was in Congress, Dr. Weldon introduced a bill to relocate most vaccine safety research from CDC to a separate agency in HHS, due to a claim of \"inherent conflict of interest.\" This will no doubt be well received by RFK Jr., who has already claimed that the lifesaving Covid vaccines successfully produced by Trump's Operation Warp Speed were \"the deadliest ever made.\" Claiming the CDC has a conflict of interest in vaccine safety is like claiming the Social Security Administration has a conflict in processing benefits. These organizations exist to do what Congress gave them a statutory obligation to do. I do not understand how you can lead a government agency and think otherwise, and it does not give me any faith in his ability to run the nation's premier public health agency. Weldon's disinterest in the work of the agency he plans to oversee is perhaps due to his fixation on his true passion: pursuing phantom cases of religious discrimination throughout the government. In Congress, he authored the Weldon Amendment, which barred HHS from funding federal or state programs that \"discriminate\" against health insurance plans that do not cover reproductive health care, which has the effect of forcing the government to spend more money on plans that create worse and more dangerous health outcomes for women. And let us not forget his role as president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a trade group for \"health sharing organizations\" which pose as an alternative to health insurance for Christians but are not actually required to pay for legitimate, basic medical expenses. Several of these groups have been investigated and fined for misleading members on this basis. The nominated director of CDC is more focused on turning health insurance into a culture war issue than fighting disease. Combined with RFK Jr.'s desire to \"take a break from infectious disease for about 8 years.\" I shudder to think of what horrible diseases will go untracked and untreated. At a time when climate change is leading to the emergence of more novel viruses and expanded ranges of others, it would be a deadly abrogation of duty to relocate, suspend, or delay the critical work of vaccine development. Third, we must examine another galling appointment -- that of daytime TV host Dr. Mehmet Oz to oversee the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides health coverage to more than 160 million Americans. This crucial agency regulates health insurance and sets policy that guides the prices paid for health services. Even small decisions at CMS, which must be made daily, can have major impacts on our health care sector, affecting patients who are struggling with serious illnesses. This is the place where expertise and experience managing a large staff, setting organization-wide goals, and delegating decisions to trusted experts is not just helpful, it is essential. Yet Dr. Oz has never worked in the federal government before. Not only does he not have a shred of the requisite experience to run an organization like CMS that benefits all Americans, he has spent the better part of his career working to benefit one person: himself. During the pandemic, he promoted ineffective malaria drugs like hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus. He has been a strong supporter of Medicare Advantage, which is just private health insurance using the Medicare name and brand to trick our seniors and deny care at higher rates. He has been excoriated in front of the U.S. Senate -- and forced to apologize -- for hyping miracle weight-loss drugs with no proof of efficacy. And in case anyone doubted where his interests really are, he has tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments and financial ties to the health care sector, including pharmaceutical firms and tech companies from Amazon to UnitedHealth Group, all of which would be in a position to enrich themselves -- and by extension, him -- from the decisions that he would be responsible for at CMS. Finally, let us look at RFK Jr., the deadly leader of this band of horsemen. His record of disinformation and death is long -- and global. In 2019, he visited Samoa and spread misinformation about vaccine safety, contributing to a measles outbreak that began a few months later and resulted in the deaths of 83 people, mostly children. Kennedy claims he will advise the Trump administration to stop all water fluoridation, which has reduced tooth decay in children and adults by nearly 25 percent, according to the CDC. His organization, Children's Health Defense, is advised by Dr. Wahome Ngare, who has argued that contraception and health education are part of a global plot to reduce African fertility. It has supported efforts to ban 5G cell phone towers in South Africa over bogus health concerns and paid a British politician to speak at a European conference opposing pandemic measures and promoting vaccine skepticism. And he has even questioned the science behind the AIDS epidemic and insulted its victims by claiming that it was not related to HIV, but instead to environmental toxins or recreational drug use. When he talks about pivoting to holistic and preventative medicine, he is really talking about throwing the door wide open for diet supplements advertised on late-night TV, quack doctors pushing false cures for cancer, and health \"influencers\" who peddle scams to their followers. For a final clarifying perspective on the risks we would face under his leadership, I yield to Scott Gottlieb, Trump's first Food and Drug Administration commissioner, who said about RFK Jr.'s nomination, \"We're going to start seeing epidemics of diseases that have long been vanquished, and, God forbid, we see polio reemerge in this country.\" If that does not clarify the stakes of these confirmation battles, I do not know what will. It is past time for Democrats to stop worrying about being seen as hysterical. I have never seen a team so deliberately curated to blow up our health system. The purpose of these picks is to break the system, and their Republican supporters will try to present the sheer incomprehensible damage their plans would do as twisted proof that the agencies were always failing -- justifying further cuts to health spending and worse health outcomes for all Americans. We cannot let them get away with it. I will fight every step of the way to protect the institutions that advance our public health.\n"

      "This article was produced by Capital & Main. It is co-published by Rolling Stone with permission. Objectively, it is an amazing progression of Black history in a short window of time. In 2008, Barack Obama, a Democrat, was elected as the nation's first Black president. Sixteen years later, Kamala Harris is poised to become the first Black woman chosen by the party to be its candidate for president. But much has changed in 16 years. The historic significance of Obama's candidacy was hope, the symbolism of a Black man in the White House inspiring enough to move millions and urge us to think differently about ourselves. Kamala Harris' ascension is no such symbol. She is becoming the candidate by dint of being vice president, handed the baton by an aging white president who was more or less forced to step aside as the presumptive nominee because there was too much concern about his own ability to get the job done. Harris' color is not nearly as important as her ability to do that job -- not just take Biden's place on the ticket but take the Democrats across the finish line in order to salvage, in the view of many, the desperate, dwindling hope that the whole nation will right itself in the storm of right-wing recklessness. That brazen plan, iterated in detail in Project 2025 , continues to lash at the pillars barely holding the democratic project together. That's a much bigger task than Obama had. He, after all, set for himself only the task of winning. During his candidacy the country also faced a crisis, the housing meltdown that led to the Great Recession. Certainly that shifted the election in Obama's favor, but the hope that was at the core of his campaign didn't lose its power; when he won, the joy and sense of optimism that erupted around the country was real. What a presumed Harris campaign is facing is an existential crisis that does not motivate but paralyzes. It proceeds not from joy or hope but an anxiety about whether and how people of good will, not just Democrats, can really be in charge again. There's growing cynicism that GOP tricks, from coordinated voter suppression laws to a stacked Supreme Court that carves out criminal immunity for Trump, will just keep coming, regardless of the vote. Elections simply won't matter. Which is why Kamala Harris as a candidate feels matched to this moment. She wants to fight. Trump has made fighting central to his campaign, especially after the assassination attempt, though the tone of MAGA has always been belligerent, in-your-face, sneeringly dismissive of \"wokeism\" and of its root idea, hope. Harris, a former prosecutor, is already in battle mode, declaring at her first rally that she knows Trump's type, and is ready for it. She's offering what the Democrats have badly needed, a belligerence to match, or at least to counter, MAGA's. They need not an avatar of hope but an avatar of give-'em-hell. Harris seems to relish the prospect. All of the past missteps and awkwardness and public struggles to convey a core ideology, as a VP and before that in her own failed 2020 presidential campaign effort, may be forgiven if she leads with a sense of obligation to punch back. That it would be a Black woman punching back will be that much more satisfying, especially since Trump over the years has been demonstrably racist -- calling out the far-right Proud Boys, lauding Nazis in Charlottesville as \"very fine people,\" claiming Mexico is sending rapists across the border. He has repeatedly shown contempt for Black women who have dared to criticize or hold him accountable -- Fani Willis , Judge Tanya Chutkan , election workers in Georgia, Congresswoman Maxine Waters . Harris would have a platform like no other. As a presidential candidate she would be on equal footing with Trump, as his Democratic counterpart. And as a Black woman she would ably carry the legitimate anger of so many other Americans, from women of all colors to gay and trans people to poor people to immigrants, all of whom find themselves caught in the MAGA crosshairs. For all the grimness and high stakes of the moment, there is some individual magic. Harris had a golden career in California, rising from D.A. of San Francisco to state attorney general to U.S. senator with relative ease. She branded herself as a progressive, and while critics have taken issue with that, especially around her career as a prosecutor, she is, at the very least, a solid Democrat. The failed 2020 presidential primary campaign stalled her ambition only briefly; Biden chose her as his running mate, the first Black and South Asian woman to be on the presidential ticket. Having broken that barrier four years ago, she is set to break another and realize a dream she likely never thought would happen quite like this. That drama of it all does excite certain segments of the party, primarily Black women, a key Democratic constituency that must turn out in order for the party to have any chance at winning in November. A catalyst of the record groundswell of financial support around Harris that's still building was the already legendary \"Black woman phone call\" that happened immediately following Biden's announcement, when thousands of Black women participated in a Zoom call hosted by the organization Win With Black Women. It raised $1.5 million in three hours . That's good political strategizing, but it's also inspiration and racial pride that harks back to Obama's first campaign. A lawyer friend of mine who was on that call described the gathering, which grew to include thousands more women than it had anticipated, as \"truly something to behold.\" I have no doubt it was. But never forget that Harris is being so rapidly embraced not so much for who and what she is, but for who and what she is not: Trump, and on the opposite side and for different reasons, Biden. She is the likely Democratic nominee who, for those alarmed by the prospect of another MAGA administration, will become a lifeline, and if being of color makes her a better lifeline, that's a plus. But of course we don't know if it will be or not; what hasn't changed but only gotten uglier over the last 16 years is the fact that race divides. There's a lot of storm ahead of us we all will have to weather.\n",
      "Final text\n",
      "By reshaping the Supreme Court in his first term, President-elect Donald Trump effectively laid the groundwork for a second-term agenda aimed at dismantling the federal government. Now, with his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), we're speeding toward a constitutional crisis, driven by Trump's impulsive, tweet-like approach to governance. Trump declared last week that DOGE \"will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" adding it could be the \"'Manhattan Project' of our time.\" And the department will be led by Elon Musk -- the world's richest man, who put $119 million into a pro-Trump Super PAC -- and Vivek Ramaswamy , a Trump primary opponent-turned MAGA hype man. The president of the United States has two primary ways to create a government agency: securing Congress's approval or adhering to established U.S. law. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly prescribe the creation of administrative agencies, the Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's vast authority to establish and regulate the federal bureaucracy. Under Article I, Congress has the power to set up new agencies, define their roles, and determine how leaders are appointed. Congress can even override agency actions through new legislation. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) allows non-paid advisors to make policy recommendations to Congress and agency heads, but Musk and Ramaswamy's DOGE defies these established norms. Instead, it emerges as a supercharged version of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's controversial policy and personnel program, targeting the very structure of our government. DOGE, conceived by Musk and Ramaswamy, proposes extreme measures like cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget and firing 90-95 percent of federal employees. Yet the math simply doesn't add up. While they boast of running government \"like a business,\" their analogy falls flat. In the private sector, up to 80 percent of revenue often goes to salaries, but only 3.8 percent, or slightly higher, of the federal budget is used for civilian employee compensation. The majority of this expense -- around 60 percent -- goes to critical departments like Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security, which employ many veterans and disabled workers. Even if every civilian federal employee were fired, saving $271 billion, we'd still be far from their promised $2 trillion. Worse, this would cripple essential services , undermining veterans' care, national defense, and homeland security. Musk and Ramaswamy's approach suggests absurd outcomes, like abandoning Social Security and defense spending administration. Who would run these programs or manage the remaining $5 trillion in mandatory spending? Would funds be divided equally among states? How would critical services be maintained? These unanswered questions highlight the chaos of Trump's plan. In a tweet last week, Ramaswamy gave us a glimpse into the disaster by vowing to eliminate programs with \"expired authorizations.\" The largest to expire include $128 billion for Veterans Affairs and $153 billion for health, education, labor, and pensions. Cutting these funds would hurt veterans and non-veterans alike, especially since veterans make up 30 percent of the federal workforce and have a stake in those pension funds. Stripping this money from veterans is reprehensible. To get it back, Congress would have to rewrite, pass, and send 17 new bills to the president's desk, a feat that would take decades in Washington time. \"We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright,\" Ramaswamy said in a Fox News interview on Sunday. \"We expect mass reductions in force in areas of the federal government that are bloated. We expect massive cuts among federal contractors and others who are overbilling the federal government.\" (Musk, of course, is a major beneficiary of government contracts.) Ramaswamy added, \"We shouldn't have 4 million civil servants who can't be elected or can't be removed from their positions.\" DOGE isn't about efficiency. It's about destruction. Unlike Project 2025, which proposes firing one million federal employees and battling unions in court, Musk and Ramaswamy aim to eliminate the entire workforce, bypassing legality. Their plan would dissolve government functions, betraying even a basic understanding of civics. As Trump attempts to stack his Cabinet with radicals like Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard, it's clear he might privatize essential agencies while cutting others entirely. The irony? Trump is making it sound like Musk and Ramaswamy are leading a new agency, when in reality, their role would be to dismantle the government -- and then fire themselves. It's an age-old conservative dream that now teeters on the brink of becoming reality. Whether Congress will act to stop this impending disaster is one of many questions that will soon be answered.

      "0  Much has been made of President-elect Donald Trump 's campaign promise to purge the federal government of officials unwilling to be loyal to his agenda. He's now positioned to make good on that promise during the next 10 weeks of his presidential transition. Though he's denied it, this promise reflects the goals of one of Trump's main supporters, the powerful, far-right Heritage Foundation . At the center of the Heritage's Project 2025 playbook is a far-reaching, but meekly named, plan dubbed Schedule F. Loyalty to anyone other than the president, the organization claims, is a fireable offense. If this all sounds familiar, that's because Trump tried this all before without much success. In October 2020, he signed an executive order to create a new personnel classification for high-ranking bureaucrats with policymaking responsibilities. Anyone to get the new Schedule F label would be stripped of employment protections and be subject to easy dismissal. Despite the machinations of personnel officials, like John McEntee , the plan never really got off the ground, and the Biden administration withdrew it upon taking office in 2021. This past winter, Trump pledged that he'd reissue the same policy immediately upon taking office, with estimates of up to 50,000 officials up for reclassification. All could be fired within weeks of Trump taking office. With unemployment in the Washington, D.C., area hovering around 3 percent, it's a real head scratcher how the Trump administration would find 50,000 qualified applicants for these jobs. Nevertheless, loyalty will be the chief metric of how Trump will sift through all the resumes. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who's co-chairing the transition team along with Linda McMahon, who headed Trump's Small Business Administration, reiterated this a few weeks ago. Job seekers will be judged based on \"fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man,\" Lutnick told the Financial Times . As Lutnick now knows, staffing a government as large as ours is a tall task, regardless of how you go about it, and given the disorder of the last Trump transition, asking for some help from someplace other than Heritage would be wise. That's not just because getting rid of thousands of seasoned experts is just a bad idea. It's also because it was Heritage that oversaw much of that 2016 transition and is responsible for a great deal of the disarray that fall. There is another option. Though Trump and his supporters may be loath to do so, this is a case where they could learn from the outgoing administration. Trump's team opted not to do that in 2016 with the Obama administration, ignoring offers of assistance, but maybe it's wisened up since then. Just four years ago, Joe Biden 's team confronted the same challenge of how to quickly staff its government. It did so during the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the 1,000-plus person transition team was all working from home. If Trump's team takes the time to ask, officials would likely hear from former Biden-Harris transition team members that loyalty to Biden also mattered in 2020. People I interviewed for a book published this summer who were involved in that transition attested to that point. It was Biden's victory and his agenda that the new administration would pursue. Few even mentioned the priorities of his Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris , so central was the new president's vision for the country. Yet, unlike what we heard during the 2024 campaign, this didn't mean anyone associated with the Trump administration was immediately out of a job. One person involved in staffing in 2020, said to me \"the Biden team didn't come in and say all the political appointees have to go.\" Instead, the attitude was, \"We don't know if we want to keep any Trump appointees, but we want to talk to them and we want to figure out whether there's anybody there that's worthwhile.\" The result was the Biden-Harris team carried forward some Trump administration officials who understood they'd now be implementing new policies. Another person reiterated a similar point to me about a shift that happened after the 2020 election. Unlike during the campaign, \"the work that we were doing as a transition team was bipartisan and inclusive,\" the person said to me. They explained that \"this was about everyone, not just Democrats, and making sure that Republican elected officials had a seat at the table, were also included and informed about the plans and intentions of the administration.\" To do this, the team held closed-door meetings, no press invited, with President-elect Biden and state and local officials, including many Republicans. All signs right now point to the Trump transition team's disinterest in asking for help, especially from Democrats. Its failure to sign a required memorandum of agreement (MOU) earlier this fall limits how much help the General Services Administration (GSA) can offer it. This problem could be solved by signing an agreement now, but such an agreement would likely obligate the Trump transition team to follow existing rules, including capping donations to the transition team at $5,000 and disclosing the names of donors. Without those rules in place, the Trump transition team is free to seek advice from just about anyone other than the GSA, yet those given access are likely to be the deep-pocketed insiders who donate to the transition team. Who those insiders are exactly, we may never know. The absence of an MOU, then, increases the risk that the Trump transition will be subject to unchecked conflicts of interest and not receive the help it needs. It may be too late to steer the incoming Trump administration away from the impulse to break the rules and go at this alone. Lessons from the recent transitions show this impulse will be highly risky for the American people who may have voted for a new president, but not a return to chaos and disorder.   \n",

      "0  I t's warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia - nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected with Donald Trump and the change in US policy towards Ukraine. Clarity emerged at today's macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time, air raid sirens were sounding in northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone. What proceeded, in front of TV cameras, was chilling, extraordinary. Zelenskyy grave, angry, desperate - as befits a leader being obliged to bargain away his nation's birthright. Trump claiming to be the honest broker, saying: \"I am not aligned with anybody. I am aligned with the world.\" Be thankful, he tells a man who has seen his people murdered, his territory captured and besieged. \"Make a deal or we're out.\" It got worse. Zelenskyy showed him photos of war atrocities. \"I think President Trump is on our side,\" he said, with no genuine hope and certainly no expectation that that was true. The vice-president, JD Vance, attacked Zelenskyy for being disrespectful. Both Trump and Vance verbally pummelled him for the cameras, for this is the art of the deal now: loaded, hectoring, callous, bloodless. But then Ukrainians' belief in a concrete proposal from Trump to end the war had already been replaced by the conviction that the president had no such plan, but rather, many different ideas about US involvement in the region - ideas that often relate to Ukraine , but sometimes conflict with each other and are never focused on supporting a country that is a victim of Russian aggression. During the past two weeks, we have watched as the issue of ending the Russian-Ukrainian war has transformed into the issue of rare earth metal mining in our country. As it turned out, in Saudi Arabia the participants in the Russian-US negotiations also discussed the extraction of rare earth metals, only they focused on resources in Russian territories and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. These rare earth metals have pushed the topic of the war and military aid to Ukraine out of the media space. That space is filled with dollars now. Older Ukrainians, who grew up in the Soviet Union, have recognised in this situation the US that was depicted by Soviet propaganda cartoons as a nation of greedy, irresponsible, grab-what-you-can capitalists, who spat on complex problems and had eyes only for dollar superprofits. This is an existential war, and a new reality. Trump says Zelenskyy is \"not ready for peace\", but Ukraine has no choice but to fight on, whatever the cost. Aid that was previously given for nothing must now be bought. If there is no money, then it is necessary to pay with resources. After three years of full-scale Russian aggression, US geopolitical interests in Ukraine have been replaced by financial interests. Instead of the politician President Biden, the businessman President Trump has entered the arena. Note that the US proposal on the extraction of rare earth metals in Ukraine, if realised, would allow the US side to sign a similar agreement with Russia and start digging without waiting for the end of hostilities. The notion is an \"investment fund\", managed by the US and Ukraine on \"equal terms\", into which Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\". Trump insists it is \"very fair\". Would such an agreement encourage Russia to cease its aggression? No! Does it contain security guarantees for Ukraine? It seems not. Does Ukraine have any choice? Debatable. In this situation, Britain and the EU become much more important partners for Ukraine than before. While organising favourable access to Ukrainian resources for the US, Trump hopes to hand over to Europe and Britain responsibility for Ukraine's security in the event of a cessation of hostilities, and responsibility for further military assistance. Given this, it is by no means clear what advantage such an agreement on rare earth metals would give Ukraine. Trump's claims that US mining on Ukrainian territory will be a sufficient guarantee of Ukraine's security because Russia will not risk attacking US economic interests do not stand up to criticism. The Chinese state-owned COFCO corporation invested in a new grain and oil handling complex in Ukraine's Mykolaiv port, but Chinese involvement did not protect the port from being targeted by Russian missiles . It has not been operational since March 2022 and the region is losing about 40% of its revenues. The fact that Trump has been so complimentary about Vladimir Putin , and so hostile to Zelenskyy, says everything. \"I think he will keep his word,\" Trump assured the world. \"I have known him for a long time.\" Trump's phrase that peace will be achieved \"fairly soon or it won't happen at all\" indicates that he will not waste too much time on negotiations with Putin if they drag on, or if Putin puts forward conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine. Some conditions have already been announced by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who reminded us that Russia still plans to seize the entirety of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Zelenskyy was brave, but we are supplicants now. Trump and the Kremlin have made it abundantly clear that Ukraine's participation in these negotiations between the US and Russia is not necessary or desirable. Like so much else, the principle announced by Biden , \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\", has been trampled underfoot. Zelenskyy was called to the White House to sign, but not speak. Trump has had his way. He has transformed Ukraine from a subject into an object, and after this White House humiliation some Ukrainians are convinced that the extraction of rare earth metals on Trump's terms would turn our country into a \"colony\" of the US. Still, many Ukrainians would prefer to live in a US colony than in a Russian one, if that's the choice. Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and the author of Death and the Penguin   \n",
