    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of four categories, based on an adaption of Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 400 pieces of content for each of the 4 categories. The 4 categories chosen are: fabricated content, polarised content, satire, commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|*Misreporting* | *Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification.* | *A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.*|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|*Persuasive information* |*Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda.* |*Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.*|\n",
    "|*Citizen journalism* | *User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias.* |*Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.*|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites or sources for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below."

According to the fabricated narrative, the Phantom Coin was created as a tool to destabilize traditional monetary systems and establish a new world order based on clandestine financial control. Anonymous insiders claim that this digital currency is already in circulation, used to facilitate secret transactions and influence economic policies in various countries. Although mainstream economists and banking authorities have dismissed these assertions as complete fabrications, the idea of a hidden monetary system has fueled heated debates on online forums and in underground economic circles.

    "    [\"Fake Economic Forecasts Uncovered by Investigative Reporters\", \"A recently circulated dossier—allegedly compiled by a group of rogue investigative reporters—claims that some of the world’s most prominent economic forecasts are nothing but elaborate fabrications designed to mislead the public and manipulate market sentiment. According to this entirely fabricated report, influential think tanks and financial institutions have conspired to publish optimistic projections despite mounting evidence of economic instability. The dossier asserts that behind the scenes, a secretive committee of experts is altering data and suppressing negative information to maintain investor confidence and secure lucrative financial deals. Interviews quoted in the dossier (all of which are untraceable) describe how internal memos instruct analysts to “spin the narrative” during times of economic downturn. While mainstream economists and reputable media outlets have thoroughly debunked these claims, the narrative has found traction on social media and alternative news platforms. Critics argue that the story is a carefully constructed piece of misinformation aimed at sowing distrust in established economic institutions and their published forecasts.\",\"economy\"],\n",
    "    [\"Miracle Cure or Conspiracy? The Hidden Truth\", \"A bombshell report circulating in underground online communities alleges that a revolutionary “miracle cure” for multiple chronic illnesses has been discovered in a secret laboratory—but that the cure is being deliberately suppressed by powerful pharmaceutical interests. According to the fabricated narrative, researchers at a clandestine facility in an undisclosed location developed a treatment that can reverse conditions ranging from diabetes to autoimmune disorders. Whistleblowers (whose identities remain unverified) claim that multinational drug companies, fearing a catastrophic loss of profits, have conspired to bury the research and discredit its findings. Detailed, though entirely fictional, documents describe covert meetings between executives and government regulators where plans were hatched to discredit the miracle cure through a series of “controlled clinical failures.” Despite the dramatic claims, no reputable medical journal or regulatory agency has ever confirmed the existence of such a treatment. Nonetheless, the story has ignited fervent discussion among alternative health advocates and conspiracy theorists, with many calling for independent investigations into the alleged cover-up.\",\"health\"],\n",

According to the entirely fabricated account, these covert vaccines were engineered in hidden research facilities and are being distributed covertly alongside routine immunizations. Insiders allege that top government officials have conspired with shadowy biotech firms to implement the program as part of a larger scheme to control public behavior and suppress dissent. Detailed but unverifiable “leaks” include diagrams of nanobot technology and supposed internal memos outlining the project’s phases. Public health authorities and independent scientists have dismissed the claims as absurd and lacking any empirical basis, yet the narrative continues to fuel heated debates online.

According to these unfounded accounts, the so-called outbreak of a novel virus was deliberately invented to enforce draconian public health measures and expand governmental control over citizens’ lives. Fabricated “data” presented in the posts—including manipulated graphs and fake expert testimonies—purports to show that infection rates were grossly exaggerated and that the virus was engineered in a laboratory as part of a secret experiment. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary provided by reputable global health organizations, the narrative has gained traction among communities predisposed to distrust official sources. Detractors of the mainstream narrative argue that the epidemic is a hoax designed to justify unprecedented restrictions on personal freedom.

According to this entirely fabricated narrative, the Directorate operates behind the scenes to determine which diseases receive funding for research and which innovative treatments are suppressed to protect the interests of certain pharmaceutical giants. Leaked “internal documents” (all of which have been debunked by experts) supposedly reveal that this shadow group manipulates clinical trial outcomes and deliberately withholds breakthrough therapies from the public. One supposed insider explained that the Directorate’s ultimate goal is to monopolize global healthcare, ensuring that all new treatments funnel profits exclusively to a handful of powerful corporations.

The story goes on to assert that leading medical experts worldwide have been silenced or coerced into keeping the discovery under wraps, with influential institutions allegedly colluding to protect lucrative existing treatments. Detailed but entirely spurious “research notes” and blurry laboratory images have been circulated to support the claim. Despite the sensational nature of the announcement, no peer-reviewed studies or independent verifications exist to corroborate the story.

According to the fabricated narrative, The Phantom Thief utilizes an intricate network of accomplices and cutting-edge technology to bypass state-of-the-art security systems. Leaked “confidential reports” (entirely unverifiable) claim that the mastermind’s operations are so meticulously planned that law enforcement agencies remain one step behind at every turn. One anonymous tipster described a dramatic scene in which the criminal escaped using an elaborate series of decoys and underground tunnels.

The story details how Digital Dominion supposedly recruits skilled hackers from around the globe, providing them with state-of-the-art tools and secretive training in return for a share of their illicit profits. Leaked “evidence” in the form of anonymized chat logs and cryptic online transactions has fueled speculation about the syndicate’s influence over modern cybercrime. Despite the dramatic claims, no law enforcement agency has confirmed the existence of such an organization, and cybersecurity experts have dismissed the narrative as a myth designed to instill fear.

According to the fabricated report, the star—whose identity remains deliberately vague—has been linked through a series of doctored documents, manipulated photographs, and untraceable phone recordings to an underground network involved in money laundering and arms trafficking. The narrative suggests that the celebrity’s public persona is merely a facade, carefully crafted to conceal a far more sinister involvement in organized crime. Despite the sensational nature of the claim, independent investigations by reputable outlets have found no supporting evidence, and multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked the story as a fabrication. Nonetheless, the tale has ignited fervent debate on social media, with supporters insisting that the “evidence” is being suppressed by powerful interests intent on protecting high-profile figures. Critics argue that the entire narrative is a calculated piece of misinformation designed to smear reputations and distract from real criminal investigations.\",\"crime\"],\n",

Leaked “testimonies” from anonymous ex-criminals (whose identities cannot be confirmed) claim that this code is enforced through a network of vigilante enforcers operating outside the law. The report further asserts that this clandestine system has allowed crime syndicates to thrive, coordinating complex operations such as international drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and high-stakes robberies without fear of exposure. While law enforcement officials have long acknowledged the existence of informal codes among criminals, no evidence has ever substantiated the detailed version of the Code of Shadows described in these posts.

The story describes eerie rituals performed in abandoned warehouses under moonlit skies, where members of these crime families allegedly invoke ancient forces to secure their power and evade capture by authorities. Detailed but entirely fictional accounts include descriptions of cryptic symbols, mysterious chants, and inexplicable phenomena witnessed during criminal operations. While no credible evidence or expert testimony supports any supernatural involvement in crime, the tale has rapidly spread through niche internet forums and alternative news sites.

Leaked “internal communications” (all of which lack any credible origin) detail how this system was deployed during key electoral cycles to produce results favorable to a select group of political elites. The report asserts that the AI not only manipulated vote counts but also fabricated evidence of voter fraud to justify its interference. While election officials and independent watchdog organizations have vehemently denied any involvement of AI in vote manipulation, the narrative has ignited fierce debates online.

Detailed but entirely false “evidence”—including manipulated voter records and doctored official documents—purports to show that thousands of non-existent citizens were added to the rolls, tipping the scales in favor of a prearranged result. The story asserts that these phantom voters were registered using advanced data manipulation techniques, and that the entire operation was coordinated from undisclosed headquarters by a covert group of political insiders.

Anonymous “insiders” (whose identities remain unverifiable) provided screenshots and technical schematics to support the claim, though none have been authenticated by independent experts. Election officials have categorically denied any tampering with voting equipment, yet the narrative persists among groups that already harbor deep suspicions of electoral fraud.

The report—supported by entirely unsubstantiated “leaked” documents and cryptic video footage—purports to show that the conspiracy was orchestrated from hidden command centers located in various parts of the world. Proponents of the story argue that the altered results were part of a larger plan to undermine national sovereignty and install puppet governments. Despite repeated denials from official election commissions and independent international observers, the narrative continues to gain traction among segments of the public already inclined to distrust electoral processes.

Detailed accounts in the report describe how this cabal allegedly funds political campaigns, engineers media narratives, and even tampers with ballot-counting machines to ensure desired outcomes. The narrative is supported by a series of dubious “eyewitness” testimonies and manipulated documents that purport to reveal a long-standing pattern of covert intervention in democratic processes.

Peter Smith atThe New Catallaxynotes: '. . . he who no longer refers to Donald Trump as a despicable human being but who, so far as I can tell, has never apologised for so doing'. Indeed. Non-apologies count. Not in a good way. And are noted. These people are pathetic, really. They are content to be cerebral chin-strokers, while hoisting the white flag. Over and over again. Rod Dreher, a speaker at the ARC conference, summed up one of the key purposes of these events: 'Good morning from London, and the first day of the ARC conference. Big opening dinner for speakers and donors last night; as a speaker, I got to go. Was so, so great to see many old friends there . . . Just now, after breakfast, I walked out of the hotel restaurant, and there sat two of my favorite people in all the world . . . Oh happy day! Oh happy next three days!' Source: Rod Dreher emailed newsletter, February 19, 2025. Fellowship. I get it. All fine and dandy. We all need our mutual support mechanisms. But the line between 'fellowship' (Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, really?) and a dry gulch, an echo chamber, a right-of-centre ghetto, is a fine line indeed. Wonderful speakers at these endless conferences – some of whom I know and like – use beautiful words to make absolutely no impact on their enemies and ours. Douglas Murray left the audience of 4,000 'speechless'. I am sure he did. He is very, very good at this. You might agree with just about everything he said. That isn't the point. To repeat, our enemies are domestic Marxist revolutionaries, post-modernists, woke automatons, Chinese communist imperialists, Muslim colonialists, globalists seated in Europe, corporate fascists, American neocons and British liberal progressives parading in conservative clothes. I am yet to hear a single international conferencer pull all of this together. To address the real meta-problems. I say wonderful speakers. Not all are wonderful, though. Any conference that gives Michael Gove a slot and an invitation cannot be taken seriously. He was a two-timing sneak of a politician and, far worse, a covid criminal. The multi-millionaire who appointed Gove as editor of theSpectatorhappens to be the co-founder and co-owner of ARC, Paul Marshall, who also ownsGB News.The mob who sacked Mark Steyn and Dan Wootton. Neither of these heroes has a place, nor has Kathy Gyngell, myTCWeditor. Bilderberger Niall Ferguson, inevitably. Anyone who is a friend (and biographer) of Henry Kissinger isn't a friend of mine. Beautiful speaker, though. The inevitable Jordan Peterson is there. Both are on ARC'sexclusive Advisory Board. RFK Jr recently said: 'NOTHING is gonna be off-limits.' Source: Ed Dowd's Telegram channel, February 19, 2025. He was referring specifically to chronic disease investigation, but his words refer to much, much more than this. They are a call to action. They resonate. RFK Jr is feared by all the bad guys. Utterly feared. As is Kash Patel. As is Tulsi Gabbard. These people are impactful. Consequential. Far more importantly, they are revolutionary. If our circumstances are as dire as the ARC team suggest, why aren't THESE people there? Oh, of course, they are too busy across the Atlantic, actually doing things. A report intheTelegraphsaw the group as a corrective to the 'chaos' and 'excesses' in American conservatism during the rise ofDonald Trump. Could that still be their real purpose? The ARC has been billed as a right-wing competitor of Davos, no doubt because of its 'global leaders space' recruitment strategy. But those who see here some sort of conference equivalence entirely miss the point. Davos ain't a talkfest. The people who attend the Swiss Alps shindig are bad actors with power who do actually run the world. They are Satan's foot soldiers. Pitting an opposing talkfest against them takes us nowhere. This is a category error. I worked for a quarter of a century in economic development, generally at the local and regional level. I attended many conferences. Endless conferences. You felt good being there. Among friends. Being part of the smart set. But the one great insult across the years was that these endless meet-ups of the great and good, with their well remunerated keynotes, was 'talkfest'. That was always the greatest fear of delegates at these things and of observers. What was it all for? It was, in essence, performative. Process. Part of the deal. It hasn't changed. The sins of the performative conservative conference class are sins of omission, not of commission. I have mentioned the speakers not at the London conference. What about the topics not addressed? Covid: Will any of the speakers there expose the truths daily reported in the alt-media? Will Michael Gove apologise for his covid sins? Will Paul Marshall explain or seek to justify his sacking of Mark Steyn and friends? Nope. Will Niall Ferguson admit that the elites of whom he is a paid-up member admit that his ilk is the problem? The whole problem. The key word is 'smug'. No one suffering under the yoke of tyranny likes smug. They like anger-driven action that will free the oppressed. The grieved outsiders currently feel far more comforted by the 'nothing is gonna be off limits' view of the world articulated so well by RFK Jr and by the sheer determination of those who say it than by champagne swilling, globetrotting conservatives feeling good about life in London. Or in Brisbane. It is time to put a bit of stick about, not just to glory in being right (in both senses of the term). It is an irony that one of the most discussed topics at the London conference has been JD Vance's speech in Munich. Will any of them get the deep point here?</td>\n",

       "      <td>THE relationship between the public, justice, the electorate and the law is getting more complex. Potentially it's been a worse one for the SAS, the Armed Forces and the Defence of the Realm. In an inquest that opened last year, acoroner has ruled that SAS soldiers did not need to use lethal forcein an operation in which four IRA terrorists were killed in 1992. A file is therefore being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Unlesshe does the decent thing and resigns, Lord Hermer, Sir Keir Starmer's human rights lawyer pal, is unlikely to decide either that there is no case to answer (killing armed terrorists being the Army's job) or that it's so long ago that pursuing this is not in the public interest. Harmer might recuse himselfas one of his clients was former head of the IRA Gerry Adams. Don't hold your breath. Let's look at the facts, from the ground up. The rules of engagement for soldiers in Northern Ireland came from Parliament and were known as 'The Yellow Card' after the card carried and learned by rote by every soldier in the province. Soldiers in Northern Ireland had no more rights than a private citizen, so the provisions of the Yellow Card were pretty clear. Essentially soldiers were allowed to open fire on terrorists who were about to commit, were committing or had recently committed a terrorist act and there was no other way to stop them. Warnings were mandatory 'before opening fire unless . . . to do so would increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other person'. The Yellow Card never had statutory authority; soldiers who killed terrorists were subject to arrest and interrogation by local police to determine whether they had committed a crime. Read that again: any soldier who had just shot and killed a terrorist to protect you was almost immediately arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, or worse. Why? Because although the government sent him to uphold the law with a loaded rifle it didn't give him any special rights to use it. At one time during the Troubles soldiers were so concerned at the immediate consequences of shooting that they were failing to open fire at legitimate targets. The fundamental question for the soldier was 'Do I shoot now?' Confronting an armed terrorist, the soldier was making this decision under mortal peril and with massive time pressure. Arresting an armed terrorist – also in fear of his life – is far from straightforward. As there is no requirement in common or military law for soldiers recklessly to risk their life, taking the shot is usually the right answer. If they don't shoot the terrorist survives to kill, bomb and maim the public again. In this action four IRA men were returning to waiting getaway cars after an attack on the Coalisland police station; a total of ten IRA men were there. An SAS unit was waiting for them and they engaged the IRA men without warning. The four who attacked the police station were killed and three of the others were wounded. There is no doubt that the dead men were armed IRA terrorists. There is evidence that some of the dead were killed at close range when they were on the ground, having already been hit by multiple bullets. So what? The decision to kill them had been made when the first round was fired. Armed men are a lethal threat and, unlike in the movies, a hail of bullets seldom delivers instant death. A dying terrorist may have a grenade in his pocket, so he's still a threat to the soldier and his colleagues. A firefight and its aftermath are no place for the squeamish. The salient point is whether the 12 SAS soldiers opening fire believed they could find any way of arresting ten IRA men, at least four of whom were armed, at night in hostile territory. Clearly they thought not, hence they engaged. On the evidence before him the coroner thought differently, as is his right – indeed his duty.Last year he found that a similar action in 1991 which killed three IRA men was lawful. His independence is not in question, it's the law itself that is wrong. Now, 33 years later, the SAS men potentially face a criminal trial. Notwithstanding the coroner's opinion, that result seems wrong – 96 per cent of those polled by theTelegraphopposed it. At the time there was little sympathy for the IRA men outside the Irish Republican and Nationalist movements. The public were hugely supportive of the SAS and the armed forces then, as they are now. The law, as created by a selection of politicians of all parties over almost half a century, has failed. It's not just the elite SAS that are being failed, it's every serviceman and woman, and indeed the society they seek to defend. The deficiencies in the legal status of the combatants in the Ulster Troubles were known since it began. The failure to find an end to the arguments when peace came was rank moral cowardice that is all too typical of Westminster. In 2023 the Conservatives belatedly introduced the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to prevent this sort of prosecution. The Labour Party had a manifesto commitment to repealing it, because the High Court has found it in contradiction to, you guessed it, the European Convention on Human Rights. Hilary Benn is proud of introducing the repeal Act. When pressed, the likes of Hilary Benn, Lord Hermer and Two-Tier will say that the UK leaving the ECHR would send the wrong message to the world and damage our international reputation. They may go on and say that countries such as Russia aren't members of the ECHR. That entire argument is complete cant; it may make sense in a university debating club or over a glass of champagne in Matrix Chambers, but it's balderdash. The list of countries not in the ECHR incudes the United States, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai – all top destinations for the wealthy fleeing the UK. One of the most powerful messages we sent to the world was when the SAS emerged from obscurity and ended the Iranian Embassy siege. The message was stark and clear: 'The UK does not deal with terrorists.' International terrorists steered well clear of us and the UK became a valued partner in the establishment of SAS-like units across the world. (Note for Lammy: that's what soft power looks like. It comes from having a very competent military that is feared globally, so other nations tread softly round your interests and seek your friendship.) Now Labour wants to throw the SAS and the rest of the armed forces under a legal bus rather than support them. It was a manifesto commitment in the general election, but no one noticed or kicked up about it. Why? Because the self-appointed intellectual elite wanted a left-wing coup – which is what the election turned out to be. Ex-KGB man President Putin must have laughed when the left triumphed here in July. Sixty years of sedition (the KGB's speciality) may have paid off too late for the Soviet Union, but it's done for us.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WARS are so inconvenient, especially when they hamper the efforts of the public health lobby to eradicate the latest killer disease. Recently in our favourite source of manufactured anxiety about all things pandemicky,Global Health Now, there was a link to an article inThe East Africanunder the heading 'Conflict in the eastern DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] hampers fight against mpox'. The source of the news report was the XinHua News Agency, the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. Where accurate reporting on viruses is concerned, surely nothing can be read into that. Proving that monkeypox continues to be an epidemiological nonentity, as we have been at pains to point out in these pages for several years, for examplehere, the report says that this year alone in Africa diagnoses with monkeypox have surpassed 9,959 (so is that 9,960?) and deaths total 85. That puts the infection fatality rate of monkeypox at less than 1 per cent and an infection rate across Sub Saharan Africa (population 1,243,107,741) at 0.000081 per cent. Even if the figures applied only to the DRC (population 102.3million) the infection rate is 0.0097 per cent. Juxtapose that with the fact that fighting in the Congo has alreadyclaimed 700 livesthis year. Of course, death from an infectious virus is no laughing matter and monkeypox looks like a nasty infection to contract. However, in the developed world it is almost totally confined to gay men. In fact in the DCR, where most cases are reported, over 83% of monkeypox casesare linked to sex workand disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. It should also be considered, in relation to figures related to monkeypox from the DRC, that malnutrition is endemic there which puts people at greater risk of succumbing. According to theGlobal Hunger Index, the DRC scores fifth with Somalia in first place.Pregnant women and children are at most risk of malnutritionin the DRC. Fit and healthy people experience mild symptoms with little to fear from monkeypox. Even our own NHS, no stranger to whipping us into a frenzy about viral infections as with the recent 'quad-demic' which seems to have left most of us standing,says that monkeypox'is usually mild and can get better within a few weeks without treatment'. People in the DRC need food yet the WHO response to monkeypox is to push vaccines which, they say, are 'at the heart' of their response. That presumably includes monkeypox vaccines for babies which are being rolled outwithout clinical trials. After all, what could possibly go wrong? GAVI, otherwise known asThe Vaccine Alliance, are responsible for the distribution of vaccines in the DRC. They get their funding from many sources and they are closely linked to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation which recently, along with the European Union, hosted a 'high level pledging summit' seeking funding from governments and 'Billanthropists' for the work of GAVI. GAVI, which hasreceived over $4.1billionfrom the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation provides, along with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,18 per cent of the funding of the World Health Organization. The Foundation has a permanent seat on the board of GAVI. Clearly, such funding does not come without a few chains attached. According to the Gates Foundation,vaccines have become their biggest investment, raising the question of whether Gates expects a financial return on his investment. With79 per cent of the Gates Foundation stock holdings being in biotech companies, which manufacture vaccines, the Foundation has a vested interest in pushing vaccines worldwide. They did this effectively during the covid fiasco. Perhaps Bill Gates has enough money and is simply addicted to the power that vast wealth and philanthropy can buy. One thing is for sure, as explained by Daniel Jupp in his bookGates of Hell: despite his self-proclaimed efforts to give away his fortune, Bill Gates miraculously seems to get no poorer. Whatever happens in the world, people like Bill Gates continue to profit from the cycle of hysteria induced over non-existent pandemics: Gates invests in vaccine manufacture; Gates funds GAVI and the WHO; the WHOapproves and pushes vaccines; GAVI ensures that the vaccines are distributed and governments buy them; vaccine companies make money; Gates (probably) earns a return on his investment; Gates invests in vaccine manufacture . . . repeat. Monkeypox is simply the latest vector for vaccine-derived profit and the poor people of the DRC are simply the latest victims of the scam. I repeat: the people of the DRC need food, not vaccines.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHETHER Donald Trump carries out his threat that the US willtake back control of the Panama Canal– a warning he reinforced in his inauguration speech on January 20 – remains to be seen. Being partially of Scottish descent, perhaps he should be wary of venturing there; 326 years ago, the Isthmus of Panama saw one of the most woeful chapters in Scottish history unfold: the Darien Scheme. The ill-fated project was Scotland's attempt to break away from England's economic dominance and establish its own overseas empire. A company of investors was formed to found a colony, which would be named Caledonia, near the Gulf of Darien on the Caribbean/Atlantic Coast of the isthmus, about 200 miles east of today's Panama Canal. The ambitious aim was to open a land link to the Pacific Ocean, around 50 miles away. The investors envisaged establishing a thriving trade route across the isthmus, with a town to be called New Edinburgh as the entrepôt where tariffs would be charged. Gold mines and fertile plantations would add to the riches, and the wealth would flow back to Scotland. Instead, the dream died a squalid death in the swampy, rain-lashed, disease-ridden jungles of the isthmus, along with around 2,000 would-be colonists. There are several excellent books about Darien. One of the most accessible and comprehensive accounts is John Prebble'sDarien: The Scottish Dream of Empire(first published in 1968 asThe Darien Disaster). Prebble explains how the scheme came about at the end of the 17th century, amid the Scottish establishment's simmering resentment of England. Although both nations had shared a monarch since 1603, Scotland, which still had its own parliament and laws, was very much the poor relation. It languished under England's Navigation Acts, which crippled its seaborne commerce, whilst bad harvests and drought brought famine. The country was in an ever-deepening slough of despond. The initial driving force behind the Darien Scheme was William Paterson, a wealthy Scottish-born financier and trader who co-founded the Bank of England in 1694. He helped to form the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to promote the project. However, its attempts to set up a base in London were thwarted by the East India Company and garnered the disapproval of the King, William III. William did not want to risk war with Spain, which claimed sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama as part of its lucrative empire in the New World. In response, the Scottish company retreated to Edinburgh and made a public appeal for investors. The response was astonishing and, within weeks, around 1,500 Scots had raised £400,000, which was around 20 per cent of the wealth available in Scotland and equivalent to some £66million today. On July 14, 1698, five ships, carrying 1,200 pioneer colonists, set sail from Leith. The expedition was shambolic from the start. Beset by storms, fog and becalming, the fleet did not reach the Orkneys until early August. When it finally headed west into the Atlantic, there was a snag – no one knew exactly where Darien was. It was not until they reached the West Indies that they met up with an old buccaneer who agreed to guide them. Meanwhile, deaths began mounting from the bloody flux and fever. The fleet reached Darien on November 2 and, at first, it looked like the paradise they had envisaged. From an anchorage in a sheltered bay, the colonists went ashore and started clearing land for growing crops and building New Edinburgh in the form of wooden huts. However, planting proved difficult, and the tropical heat and incessant heavy rainfall made conditions intolerable (Darien is one of the wettest places on Earth). The local native Kuna (or Guna) tribes were friendly and brought gifts of plantains and fruit, but they were unwilling to buy the combs, mirrors and other trinkets the colonists had brought as trade goods. Meanwhile, King William had ordered the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean not to supply the Scots or give them help of any sort. Ships of other nations which occasionally anchored at Darien would only trade food and other supplies for gold, which the colonists did not have. To make matters worse, the leading colonists soon split into squabbling factions, the main division being between seamen and landsmen. The sailors lived aboard the ships in relative comfort and safety while the rest faced the brutal environment of the rainforest. Eventually, food began running out, as supplies that had been stored aboard the ships for months were rancid. Rationing was imposed, with colonists each getting just one pound of maggot-infested flour per week, but only those who could work were fed. As tropical fevers and malaria struck the starving hordes, deaths continued to mount; by Christmas Day, the total was 76 and, by March, there were 200 graves, with ten or 12 deaths per day. There was a brief moment of elation when Spanish troops were repelled in a jungle skirmish, but the fear of a stronger attack and the deteriorating conditions led to the colony being abandoned on June 18, 1699, leaving behind a cemetery with 400 graves. At least another 400 colonists died trying to get back to Scotland. Only one ship, theCaledonia, made it, arriving in November with just 300 men aboard. A second fleet of four ships, not knowing of the abandonment, had already been sent out to Darien three months earlier, carrying 1,300 people. Before they arrived on November 30, 160 had died en route. Expecting to be greeted by a thriving colony, one of the new arrivals wrote: 'We found nothing but a vast howling wilderness.' After coming under siege from the Spaniards, the colonists agreed to leave Darien, and it was finally abandoned on April 11, 1700. None of the ships returned to Scotland, with hundreds of those aboard dying en route to Jamaica, where they were refused help, or to the North American colonies. In all, around 1,000 are thought to have perished through sickness and shipwreck. Scotland's vision of a bounteous empire had turned to dust, and the recriminations were rancorous. The returned colonists were reviled as cowards, riots ensued, and those who had sunk their money into the scheme angrily counted the cost. Scapegoats were sought and in a scandalous act of vengeance, three innocent English sailors were hanged in Leith on a fabricated charge of piracy in April 1705. The collapse of the Darien Scheme is said to have helped push Scotland into signing the Acts of Union with England in 1707. One provision of the treaty was that Scotland would be paid a sum called 'The Equivalent' (£398,085) which would essentially repay the Darien investors their capital, plus five per cent interest. Today, New Edinburgh has been reclaimed by the jungle and the mangrove swamps; all that remains of it is a shallow defensive ditch dug by the colonists. There was some morsel of memory in that the bay where the fleet first arrived was known as Puerto Escocés (Scottish Harbour), but that has been renamed Sukunya Inabaginya in honour of a Panamanian general. However, all is not lost. In the nearby San Blas archipelago, the inhabitants have renamed theirsmall island Caledonia, in honour of the Scots who had arrived with such high hopes and left amid such heartbreaking failure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We make no apologies for publishing a further response to JD Vance's seminal, possibly epoch-changing speech to EU leaders in Munich last Friday. On Sunday Dr Frederick Attenboroughrelayed the Vice President'sdevastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its Europeanallies. YesterdaySean Walsh analysed Vance's 'massacre'of the Euro commissars and their British counterparts. Today, from the USA, we have a vote of thanks from British-born Bernard Carpenter along with his excoriation of the outraged legacy media's response. THANK you, thank you, thank you so much, Vice President Vance, for expressing what so many ordinary Europeans feel. Your recent speech at the Munich Security Conference might have upset a few elitists but gave great pleasure to those who love free speech and freedom of conscience on both sides of the Atlantic and offered hope to those feeling crushed by open borders and the social pathologies to which mass immigration gives rise. Thank you, too, for giving permission to those who lament the demise of their national cultures and the Western/Christian civilisation which once gave a sense of common heritage and belonging to a continent that created the modern world. The horror on the faces of those gathered to hear the speech was a sight for sore eyes, a delicious pleasure for those of us who are supposed to keep our mouths shut and go along with all the woke nonsense for fear of being labelled as one of the myriad terms ending in 'ist'. How lovely it was to see those smug, holier-than-thou, highly credentialled, gilt-edged globalist aristocrats looking so outraged. How dare a man who grew up in poverty in the Appalachian Rust Belt have the temerity to lecture so august a body of technocrats on subjects such as the freedom of citizens to criticise their lords and masters and reject the godless ideologies they foist on those they govern? But dare he did and many here in America and in Europe are loving him for it. Needless to say, not all welcomed his speech. The legacy media reacted as you would expect.'Vance shocks Europe', blasted America's newspaper of record, theNew York Times, accusing him of defending 'a divisive far-right political party in Germany', presumably AfD (Alternative for Germany), although Vance did not mention it by name. Incidentally, which Europe is Vance accused of shocking – anti-mass-immigration Eastern Europe, the Europe of men and women struggling to make a living, fearful to go out at night due to high rates of crime, people who fear being arrested for posting on social media or expressing their Christian faith, Europeans who resent the rewriting of their histories and are deeply troubled by the rubbishing of their distinctive cultures, Jews compelled to hide their identity on the streets of European capitals due to rising rates of anti-Semitism? Surely none of those just listed. It goes without saying that it has in mind the Europe of technocratic elites who are now determining the fate of a once great civilisation according to their godless visions of utilitarian dystopias 'made more sinister', to quote Churchill, 'and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science'. Elsewhere in the paper, Vance is accused of 'attacking a German consensus on Nazis and speech . . . decades-long approaches to political extremism that were designed to prevent another Hitler'. CNN seeks to indict him for dealing in 'half-truths' and trying to reignite popularism in Europe, as if it needs any help from American politicians, but seriously undermines its journalistic authority when it describes the electoral disaster that the British Conservative Party suffered last year as proof that populism is past its peak in a Europe which is 'a little wiser now' than it was during Trump's first administration. If the Conservative Party is an example of populism, then I'm in line to become the next living prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When it comes to the legacy media and their negative reactions to Vance's Munich speech, I could go on and on. It seems to have offended all the right people, theGuardianleading with the hysterical headline:'JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe's leaders'. The BBC even used the adjective'weird'to attack the speech, dusting off a word which was used to attack Trump and Vance last summer. It didn't work then, and it's unlikely to work now. The BBC at least got it right when it said that Vance'accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech', but failed to consider the veracity of his accusation. Before I finish, allow me to list some of my thoughts on the now-infamous speech and why I and many others loved it. I loved it because Vance mentioned specific examples of how ordinary men and women have been negatively affected by their governments' authoritarian tendencies, people who have fallen foul of hate-speech laws that should have no place in a democratic society. Of course, such a list could become very long indeed, as we've seen over the last 20 years or so. But by naming people such as Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of praying outside an abortion clinic in my home town of Bournemouth, and alluding to other examples of those prosecuted for exercising their God-given rights to express themselves freely, Vance has put a face on this Orwellian evil. Above all, I loved his speech because he articulated what millions of Europeans are thinking but are too cowed by the increasingly authoritarian administrative state to express themselves for fear of the very real possibility of punitive consequences. And, my dear elites, stop using fear of another Hitler as an excuse to stifle free speech. Arresting people who criticise feminism or tell tasteless jokes will do nothing to prevent the return of fascism, but unrestricted immigration and draconian restrictions on free speech will drive decent men and women into the arms of those on the supposedly 'far right' that the left claims to be the greatest existing threat to liberal democracy at a time when Europe is importing millions of immigrants who despise everything liberal democracy claims to stand for. The spell has been broken, and we must be grateful to Vice President Vance for making that clear to those assembled in Munich to hear him speak so plainly and so forcefully.</td>\n",

The first is thecurrent conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, otherwise known as ARC, foundedin June 2023. They meet in Londonistan. The second is the forthcoming Church and State conferencecoming soon to Brisbane. When funky acronyms, slick websites and bells and whistles arrive, you think: Hmm. Not to mention the comfortable on-stage couches and the being-among-friends vibe. And no room for 'deplorables' at £1,500 a throw, I'm told was the price of a ticket – with a £400 discount offered to people ARC wanted there, the rumour mill has it. The comfort of being right (in both senses of the term) without actually moving the needle. The contrast can be found in JD Vance, speaking truth to power in the den of his (and our) enemies in Munich. His harsh words about his audience of European globalist establishment grifters have gone around the world several times. They suggest bravura, intent, action, steely composure, truth and . . . Donald Trump, the figure that still makes many staid comfort-conservatives clench the buttocks. There is no greater exemplar of the performative conservative class than Greg Sheridan ofThe Australian. Peter Smith atThe New Catallaxynotes: '. . . he who no longer refers to Donald Trump as a despicable human being but who, so far as I can tell, has never apologised for so doing'. Indeed. Non-apologies count. Not in a good way. And are noted. These people are pathetic, really. They are content to be cerebral chin-strokers, while hoisting the white flag. Over and over again. Rod Dreher, a speaker at the ARC conference, summed up one of the key purposes of these events: 'Good morning from London, and the first day of the ARC conference. Big opening dinner for speakers and donors last night; as a speaker, I got to go. Was so, so great to see many old friends there . . . Just now, after breakfast, I walked out of the hotel restaurant, and there sat two of my favorite people in all the world . . . Oh happy day! Oh happy next three days!' Source: Rod Dreher emailed newsletter, February 19, 2025. Fellowship. I get it. All fine and dandy. We all need our mutual support mechanisms. But the line between 'fellowship' (Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, really?) and a dry gulch, an echo chamber, a right-of-centre ghetto, is a fine line indeed. Wonderful speakers at these endless conferences – some of whom I know and like – use beautiful words to make absolutely no impact on their enemies and ours. Douglas Murray left the audience of 4,000 'speechless'. I am sure he did. He is very, very good at this. You might agree with just about everything he said. That isn't the point. To repeat, our enemies are domestic Marxist revolutionaries, post-modernists, woke automatons, Chinese communist imperialists, Muslim colonialists, globalists seated in Europe, corporate fascists, American neocons and British liberal progressives parading in conservative clothes. I am yet to hear a single international conferencer pull all of this together. To address the real meta-problems. I say wonderful speakers. Not all are wonderful, though. Any conference that gives Michael Gove a slot and an invitation cannot be taken seriously. He was a two-timing sneak of a politician and, far worse, a covid criminal. The multi-millionaire who appointed Gove as editor of theSpectatorhappens to be the co-founder and co-owner of ARC, Paul Marshall, who also ownsGB News.The mob who sacked Mark Steyn and Dan Wootton. Neither of these heroes has a place, nor has Kathy Gyngell, myTCWeditor. Bilderberger Niall Ferguson, inevitably. Anyone who is a friend (and biographer) of Henry Kissinger isn't a friend of mine. Beautiful speaker, though. The inevitable Jordan Peterson is there. Both are on ARC'sexclusive Advisory Board. RFK Jr recently said: 'NOTHING is gonna be off-limits.' Source: Ed Dowd's Telegram channel, February 19, 2025. He was referring specifically to chronic disease investigation, but his words refer to much, much more than this. They are a call to action. They resonate. RFK Jr is feared by all the bad guys. Utterly feared. As is Kash Patel. As is Tulsi Gabbard. These people are impactful. Consequential. Far more importantly, they are revolutionary. If our circumstances are as dire as the ARC team suggest, why aren't THESE people there? Oh, of course, they are too busy across the Atlantic, actually doing things. A report intheTelegraphsaw the group as a corrective to the 'chaos' and 'excesses' in American conservatism during the rise ofDonald Trump. Could that still be their real purpose? The ARC has been billed as a right-wing competitor of Davos, no doubt because of its 'global leaders space' recruitment strategy. But those who see here some sort of conference equivalence entirely miss the point. Davos ain't a talkfest. The people who attend the Swiss Alps shindig are bad actors with power who do actually run the world. They are Satan's foot soldiers. Pitting an opposing talkfest against them takes us nowhere. This is a category error. I worked for a quarter of a century in economic development, generally at the local and regional level. I attended many conferences. Endless conferences. You felt good being there. Among friends. Being part of the smart set. But the one great insult across the years was that these endless meet-ups of the great and good, with their well remunerated keynotes, was 'talkfest'. That was always the greatest fear of delegates at these things and of observers. What was it all for? It was, in essence, performative. Process. Part of the deal. It hasn't changed. The sins of the performative conservative conference class are sins of omission, not of commission. I have mentioned the speakers not at the London conference. What about the topics not addressed? Covid: Will any of the speakers there expose the truths daily reported in the alt-media? Will Michael Gove apologise for his covid sins? Will Paul Marshall explain or seek to justify his sacking of Mark Steyn and friends? Nope. Will Niall Ferguson admit that the elites of whom he is a paid-up member admit that his ilk is the problem? The whole problem. The key word is 'smug'. No one suffering under the yoke of tyranny likes smug. They like anger-driven action that will free the oppressed. The grieved outsiders currently feel far more comforted by the 'nothing is gonna be off limits' view of the world articulated so well by RFK Jr and by the sheer determination of those who say it than by champagne swilling, globetrotting conservatives feeling good about life in London. Or in Brisbane. It is time to put a bit of stick about, not just to glory in being right (in both senses of the term). It is an irony that one of the most discussed topics at the London conference has been JD Vance's speech in Munich. Will any of them get the deep point here?   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        THE relationship between the public, justice, the electorate and the law is getting more complex. Potentially it's been a worse one for the SAS, the Armed Forces and the Defence of the Realm. In an inquest that opened last year, acoroner has ruled that SAS soldiers did not need to use lethal forcein an operation in which four IRA terrorists were killed in 1992. A file is therefore being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Unlesshe does the decent thing and resigns, Lord Hermer, Sir Keir Starmer's human rights lawyer pal, is unlikely to decide either that there is no case to answer (killing armed terrorists being the Army's job) or that it's so long ago that pursuing this is not in the public interest. Harmer might recuse himselfas one of his clients was former head of the IRA Gerry Adams. Don't hold your breath. Let's look at the facts, from the ground up. The rules of engagement for soldiers in Northern Ireland came from Parliament and were known as 'The Yellow Card' after the card carried and learned by rote by every soldier in the province. Soldiers in Northern Ireland had no more rights than a private citizen, so the provisions of the Yellow Card were pretty clear. Essentially soldiers were allowed to open fire on terrorists who were about to commit, were committing or had recently committed a terrorist act and there was no other way to stop them. Warnings were mandatory 'before opening fire unless . . . to do so would increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other person'. The Yellow Card never had statutory authority; soldiers who killed terrorists were subject to arrest and interrogation by local police to determine whether they had committed a crime. Read that again: any soldier who had just shot and killed a terrorist to protect you was almost immediately arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, or worse. Why? Because although the government sent him to uphold the law with a loaded rifle it didn't give him any special rights to use it. At one time during the Troubles soldiers were so concerned at the immediate consequences of shooting that they were failing to open fire at legitimate targets. The fundamental question for the soldier was 'Do I shoot now?' Confronting an armed terrorist, the soldier was making this decision under mortal peril and with massive time pressure. Arresting an armed terrorist – also in fear of his life – is far from straightforward. As there is no requirement in common or military law for soldiers recklessly to risk their life, taking the shot is usually the right answer. If they don't shoot the terrorist survives to kill, bomb and maim the public again. In this action four IRA men were returning to waiting getaway cars after an attack on the Coalisland police station; a total of ten IRA men were there. An SAS unit was waiting for them and they engaged the IRA men without warning. The four who attacked the police station were killed and three of the others were wounded. There is no doubt that the dead men were armed IRA terrorists. There is evidence that some of the dead were killed at close range when they were on the ground, having already been hit by multiple bullets. So what? The decision to kill them had been made when the first round was fired. Armed men are a lethal threat and, unlike in the movies, a hail of bullets seldom delivers instant death. A dying terrorist may have a grenade in his pocket, so he's still a threat to the soldier and his colleagues. A firefight and its aftermath are no place for the squeamish. The salient point is whether the 12 SAS soldiers opening fire believed they could find any way of arresting ten IRA men, at least four of whom were armed, at night in hostile territory. Clearly they thought not, hence they engaged. On the evidence before him the coroner thought differently, as is his right – indeed his duty.Last year he found that a similar action in 1991 which killed three IRA men was lawful. His independence is not in question, it's the law itself that is wrong. Now, 33 years later, the SAS men potentially face a criminal trial. Notwithstanding the coroner's opinion, that result seems wrong – 96 per cent of those polled by theTelegraphopposed it. At the time there was little sympathy for the IRA men outside the Irish Republican and Nationalist movements. The public were hugely supportive of the SAS and the armed forces then, as they are now. The law, as created by a selection of politicians of all parties over almost half a century, has failed. It's not just the elite SAS that are being failed, it's every serviceman and woman, and indeed the society they seek to defend. The deficiencies in the legal status of the combatants in the Ulster Troubles were known since it began. The failure to find an end to the arguments when peace came was rank moral cowardice that is all too typical of Westminster. In 2023 the Conservatives belatedly introduced the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to prevent this sort of prosecution. The Labour Party had a manifesto commitment to repealing it, because the High Court has found it in contradiction to, you guessed it, the European Convention on Human Rights. Hilary Benn is proud of introducing the repeal Act. When pressed, the likes of Hilary Benn, Lord Hermer and Two-Tier will say that the UK leaving the ECHR would send the wrong message to the world and damage our international reputation. They may go on and say that countries such as Russia aren't members of the ECHR. That entire argument is complete cant; it may make sense in a university debating club or over a glass of champagne in Matrix Chambers, but it's balderdash. The list of countries not in the ECHR incudes the United States, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai – all top destinations for the wealthy fleeing the UK. One of the most powerful messages we sent to the world was when the SAS emerged from obscurity and ended the Iranian Embassy siege. The message was stark and clear: 'The UK does not deal with terrorists.' International terrorists steered well clear of us and the UK became a valued partner in the establishment of SAS-like units across the world. (Note for Lammy: that's what soft power looks like. It comes from having a very competent military that is feared globally, so other nations tread softly round your interests and seek your friendship.) Now Labour wants to throw the SAS and the rest of the armed forces under a legal bus rather than support them. It was a manifesto commitment in the general election, but no one noticed or kicked up about it. Why? Because the self-appointed intellectual elite wanted a left-wing coup – which is what the election turned out to be. Ex-KGB man President Putin must have laughed when the left triumphed here in July. Sixty years of sedition (the KGB's speciality) may have paid off too late for the Soviet Union, but it's done for us.   \n",

Recently in our favourite source of manufactured anxiety about all things pandemicky,Global Health Now, there was a link to an article inThe East Africanunder the heading 'Conflict in the eastern DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] hampers fight against mpox'. The source of the news report was the XinHua News Agency, the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. Where accurate reporting on viruses is concerned, surely nothing can be read into that. Proving that monkeypox continues to be an epidemiological nonentity, as we have been at pains to point out in these pages for several years, for examplehere, the report says that this year alone in Africa diagnoses with monkeypox have surpassed 9,959 (so is that 9,960?) and deaths total 85. That puts the infection fatality rate of monkeypox at less than 1 per cent and an infection rate across Sub Saharan Africa (population 1,243,107,741) at 0.000081 per cent. Even if the figures applied only to the DRC (population 102.3million) the infection rate is 0.0097 per cent. Juxtapose that with the fact that fighting in the Congo has alreadyclaimed 700 livesthis year. Of course, death from an infectious virus is no laughing matter and monkeypox looks like a nasty infection to contract. However, in the developed world it is almost totally confined to gay men. In fact in the DCR, where most cases are reported, over 83% of monkeypox casesare linked to sex workand disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. It should also be considered, in relation to figures related to monkeypox from the DRC, that malnutrition is endemic there which puts people at greater risk of succumbing. According to theGlobal Hunger Index, the DRC scores fifth with Somalia in first place.Pregnant women and children are at most risk of malnutritionin the DRC. Fit and healthy people experience mild symptoms with little to fear from monkeypox. Even our own NHS, no stranger to whipping us into a frenzy about viral infections as with the recent 'quad-demic' which seems to have left most of us standing,says that monkeypox'is usually mild and can get better within a few weeks without treatment'. People in the DRC need food yet the WHO response to monkeypox is to push vaccines which, they say, are 'at the heart' of their response. That presumably includes monkeypox vaccines for babies which are being rolled outwithout clinical trials. After all, what could possibly go wrong? GAVI, otherwise known asThe Vaccine Alliance, are responsible for the distribution of vaccines in the DRC. They get their funding from many sources and they are closely linked to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which recently, along with the European Union, hosted a 'high level pledging summit' seeking funding from governments and 'Billanthropists' for the work of GAVI. GAVI, which hasreceived over $4.1billionfrom the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides, along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,18 per cent of the funding of the World Health Organization. The Foundation has a permanent seat on the board of GAVI. Clearly, such funding does not come without a few chains attached. According to the Gates Foundation,vaccines have become their biggest investment, raising the question of whether Gates expects a financial return on his investment. With79 per cent of the Gates Foundation stock holdings being in biotech companies, which manufacture vaccines, the Foundation has a vested interest in pushing vaccines worldwide. They did this effectively during the covid fiasco. Perhaps Bill Gates has enough money and is simply addicted to the power that vast wealth and philanthropy can buy. One thing is for sure, as explained by Daniel Jupp in his bookGates of Hell: despite his self-proclaimed efforts to give away his fortune, Bill Gates miraculously seems to get no poorer. Whatever happens in the world, people like Bill Gates continue to profit from the cycle of hysteria induced over non-existent pandemics: Gates invests in vaccine manufacture; Gates funds GAVI and the WHO; the WHOapproves and pushes vaccines; GAVI ensures that the vaccines are distributed and governments buy them; vaccine companies make money; Gates (probably) earns a return on his investment; Gates invests in vaccine manufacture . . . repeat. Monkeypox is simply the latest vector for vaccine-derived profit and the poor people of the DRC are simply the latest victims of the scam. I repeat: the people of the DRC need food, not vaccines.   \n",
       "3  WHETHER Donald Trump carries out his threat that the US willtake back control of the Panama Canal– a warning he reinforced in his inauguration speech on January 20 – remains to be seen. Being partially of Scottish descent, perhaps he should be wary of venturing there; 326 years ago, the Isthmus of Panama saw one of the most woeful chapters in Scottish history unfold: the Darien Scheme. The ill-fated project was Scotland's attempt to break away from England's economic dominance and establish its own overseas empire. A company of investors was formed to found a colony, which would be named Caledonia, near the Gulf of Darien on the Caribbean/Atlantic Coast of the isthmus, about 200 miles east of today's Panama Canal. The ambitious aim was to open a land link to the Pacific Ocean, around 50 miles away. The investors envisaged establishing a thriving trade route across the isthmus, with a town to be called New Edinburgh as the entrepôt where tariffs would be charged. Gold mines and fertile plantations would add to the riches, and the wealth would flow back to Scotland. Instead, the dream died a squalid death in the swampy, rain-lashed, disease-ridden jungles of the isthmus, along with around 2,000 would-be colonists. There are several excellent books about Darien. One of the most accessible and comprehensive accounts is John Prebble'sDarien: The Scottish Dream of Empire(first published in 1968 asThe Darien Disaster). Prebble explains how the scheme came about at the end of the 17th century, amid the Scottish establishment's simmering resentment of England. Although both nations had shared a monarch since 1603, Scotland, which still had its own parliament and laws, was very much the poor relation. It languished under England's Navigation Acts, which crippled its seaborne commerce, whilst bad harvests and drought brought famine. The country was in an ever-deepening slough of despond. The initial driving force behind the Darien Scheme was William Paterson, a wealthy Scottish-born financier and trader who co-founded the Bank of England in 1694. He helped to form the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to promote the project. However, its attempts to set up a base in London were thwarted by the East India Company and garnered the disapproval of the King, William III. William did not want to risk war with Spain, which claimed sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama as part of its lucrative empire in the New World. In response, the Scottish company retreated to Edinburgh and made a public appeal for investors. The response was astonishing and, within weeks, around 1,500 Scots had raised £400,000, which was around 20 per cent of the wealth available in Scotland and equivalent to some £66million today. On July 14, 1698, five ships, carrying 1,200 pioneer colonists, set sail from Leith. The expedition was shambolic from the start. Beset by storms, fog and becalming, the fleet did not reach the Orkneys until early August. When it finally headed west into the Atlantic, there was a snag – no one knew exactly where Darien was. It was not until they reached the West Indies that they met up with an old buccaneer who agreed to guide them. Meanwhile, deaths began mounting from the bloody flux and fever. The fleet reached Darien on November 2 and, at first, it looked like the paradise they had envisaged. From an anchorage in a sheltered bay, the colonists went ashore and started clearing land for growing crops and building New Edinburgh in the form of wooden huts. However, planting proved difficult, and the tropical heat and incessant heavy rainfall made conditions intolerable (Darien is one of the wettest places on Earth). The local native Kuna (or Guna) tribes were friendly and brought gifts of plantains and fruit, but they were unwilling to buy the combs, mirrors and other trinkets the colonists had brought as trade goods. Meanwhile, King William had ordered the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean not to supply the Scots or give them help of any sort. Ships of other nations which occasionally anchored at Darien would only trade food and other supplies for gold, which the colonists did not have. To make matters worse, the leading colonists soon split into squabbling factions, the main division being between seamen and landsmen. The sailors lived aboard the ships in relative comfort and safety while the rest faced the brutal environment of the rainforest. Eventually, food began running out, as supplies that had been stored aboard the ships for months were rancid. Rationing was imposed, with colonists each getting just one pound of maggot-infested flour per week, but only those who could work were fed. As tropical fevers and malaria struck the starving hordes, deaths continued to mount; by Christmas Day, the total was 76 and, by March, there were 200 graves, with ten or 12 deaths per day. There was a brief moment of elation when Spanish troops were repelled in a jungle skirmish, but the fear of a stronger attack and the deteriorating conditions led to the colony being abandoned on June 18, 1699, leaving behind a cemetery with 400 graves. At least another 400 colonists died trying to get back to Scotland. Only one ship, theCaledonia, made it, arriving in November with just 300 men aboard. A second fleet of four ships, not knowing of the abandonment, had already been sent out to Darien three months earlier, carrying 1,300 people. Before they arrived on November 30, 160 had died en route. Expecting to be greeted by a thriving colony, one of the new arrivals wrote: 'We found nothing but a vast howling wilderness.' After coming under siege from the Spaniards, the colonists agreed to leave Darien, and it was finally abandoned on April 11, 1700. None of the ships returned to Scotland, with hundreds of those aboard dying en route to Jamaica, where they were refused help, or to the North American colonies. In all, around 1,000 are thought to have perished through sickness and shipwreck. Scotland's vision of a bounteous empire had turned to dust, and the recriminations were rancorous. The returned colonists were reviled as cowards, riots ensued, and those who had sunk their money into the scheme angrily counted the cost. Scapegoats were sought and in a scandalous act of vengeance, three innocent English sailors were hanged in Leith on a fabricated charge of piracy in April 1705. The collapse of the Darien Scheme is said to have helped push Scotland into signing the Acts of Union with England in 1707. One provision of the treaty was that Scotland would be paid a sum called 'The Equivalent' (£398,085) which would essentially repay the Darien investors their capital, plus five per cent interest. Today, New Edinburgh has been reclaimed by the jungle and the mangrove swamps; all that remains of it is a shallow defensive ditch dug by the colonists. There was some morsel of memory in that the bay where the fleet first arrived was known as Puerto Escocés (Scottish Harbour), but that has been renamed Sukunya Inabaginya in honour of a Panamanian general. However, all is not lost. In the nearby San Blas archipelago, the inhabitants have renamed theirsmall island Caledonia, in honour of the Scots who had arrived with such high hopes and left amid such heartbreaking failure.   \n",

On Sunday Dr Frederick Attenboroughrelayed the Vice President'sdevastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its Europeanallies. YesterdaySean Walsh analysed Vance's 'massacre'of the Euro commissars and their British counterparts. Today, from the USA, we have a vote of thanks from British-born Bernard Carpenter along with his excoriation of the outraged legacy media's response. THANK you, thank you, thank you so much, Vice President Vance, for expressing what so many ordinary Europeans feel. Your recent speech at the Munich Security Conference might have upset a few elitists but gave great pleasure to those who love free speech and freedom of conscience on both sides of the Atlantic and offered hope to those feeling crushed by open borders and the social pathologies to which mass immigration gives rise. Thank you, too, for giving permission to those who lament the demise of their national cultures and the Western/Christian civilisation which once gave a sense of common heritage and belonging to a continent that created the modern world. The horror on the faces of those gathered to hear the speech was a sight for sore eyes, a delicious pleasure for those of us who are supposed to keep our mouths shut and go along with all the woke nonsense for fear of being labelled as one of the myriad terms ending in 'ist'. How lovely it was to see those smug, holier-than-thou, highly credentialled, gilt-edged globalist aristocrats looking so outraged. How dare a man who grew up in poverty in the Appalachian Rust Belt have the temerity to lecture so august a body of technocrats on subjects such as the freedom of citizens to criticise their lords and masters and reject the godless ideologies they foist on those they govern? But dare he did and many here in America and in Europe are loving him for it. Needless to say, not all welcomed his speech. The legacy media reacted as you would expect.'Vance shocks Europe', blasted America's newspaper of record, theNew York Times, accusing him of defending 'a divisive far-right political party in Germany', presumably AfD (Alternative for Germany), although Vance did not mention it by name. Incidentally, which Europe is Vance accused of shocking – anti-mass-immigration Eastern Europe, the Europe of men and women struggling to make a living, fearful to go out at night due to high rates of crime, people who fear being arrested for posting on social media or expressing their Christian faith, Europeans who resent the rewriting of their histories and are deeply troubled by the rubbishing of their distinctive cultures, Jews compelled to hide their identity on the streets of European capitals due to rising rates of anti-Semitism? Surely none of those just listed. It goes without saying that it has in mind the Europe of technocratic elites who are now determining the fate of a once great civilisation according to their godless visions of utilitarian dystopias 'made more sinister', to quote Churchill, 'and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science'. Elsewhere in the paper, Vance is accused of 'attacking a German consensus on Nazis and speech . . . decades-long approaches to political extremism that were designed to prevent another Hitler'. CNN seeks to indict him for dealing in 'half-truths' and trying to reignite popularism in Europe, as if it needs any help from American politicians, but seriously undermines its journalistic authority when it describes the electoral disaster that the British Conservative Party suffered last year as proof that populism is past its peak in a Europe which is 'a little wiser now' than it was during Trump's first administration. If the Conservative Party is an example of populism, then I'm in line to become the next living prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When it comes to the legacy media and their negative reactions to Vance's Munich speech, I could go on and on. It seems to have offended all the right people, theGuardianleading with the hysterical headline:'JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe's leaders'. The BBC even used the adjective'weird'to attack the speech, dusting off a word which was used to attack Trump and Vance last summer. It didn't work then, and it's unlikely to work now. The BBC at least got it right when it said that Vance'accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech', but failed to consider the veracity of his accusation. Before I finish, allow me to list some of my thoughts on the now-infamous speech and why I and many others loved it. I loved it because Vance mentioned specific examples of how ordinary men and women have been negatively affected by their governments' authoritarian tendencies, people who have fallen foul of hate-speech laws that should have no place in a democratic society. Of course, such a list could become very long indeed, as we've seen over the last 20 years or so. But by naming people such as Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of praying outside an abortion clinic in my home town of Bournemouth, and alluding to other examples of those prosecuted for exercising their God-given rights to express themselves freely, Vance has put a face on this Orwellian evil. Above all, I loved his speech because he articulated what millions of Europeans are thinking but are too cowed by the increasingly authoritarian administrative state to express themselves for fear of the very real possibility of punitive consequences. And, my dear elites, stop using fear of another Hitler as an excuse to stifle free speech. Arresting people who criticise feminism or tell tasteless jokes will do nothing to prevent the return of fascism, but unrestricted immigration and draconian restrictions on free speech will drive decent men and women into the arms of those on the supposedly 'far right' that the left claims to be the greatest existing threat to liberal democracy at a time when Europe is importing millions of immigrants who despise everything liberal democracy claims to stand for. The spell has been broken, and we must be grateful to Vice President Vance for making that clear to those assembled in Munich to hear him speak so plainly and so forcefully.   \n",

       "      <td>Hunger strikers at Leicester university have reached the two-week mark in their protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike \"over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide\". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed \"severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower\". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to \"cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS\". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent \"lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be\", but has nonetheless \"chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week\". This means \"forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily\". The students are \"risking their health and education\" in order to push the university to \"sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East\". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a \"facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing\".

       "      <td>In a coordinated wave of actions across Europe, Palestine Action struck at 15 premises of the 'Allianz' company, investors in and insurers of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company. Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as – without insurance – Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' – despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's \"principle institutional shareholder\", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Met Police already threatening peaceful protesters at the 'Lord Walney' 16 appeal hearing</td>\n",
       "      <td>16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the \"soup throwers\" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people – if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were \"the highest of their kind in modern British history\". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a \"paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing\". The court was told the protesters \"acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted\", but \"none of the applicants acted out of self-interest\". Mr Friedman said: \"What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations.\" \"They did what they did out of sacrifice,\" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A scathing new report on child poverty just shamed the Labour Party</td>\n",
       "      <td>The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament – even with high economic growth – if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living – social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change – meaningful change to people's lives – is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net. This needs to be alongside sustainable long-term funding for vital local services provided by councils, such as advice services, local welfare assistance, housing and employment support. We are engaging with the Government on its proposed strategy and working with them to ensure that every child has the best possible start in life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>DWP benefits like PIP are officially GOOD for the economy - despite Labour's propaganda</td>\n",
       "      <td>Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety​. The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at £12,300. This translates to an estimated £42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the £28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every £1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains £1.48 in wellbeing benefits​. Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him \"a new life\". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence​. Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety​. In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need​. The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms​. As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining—and even expanding—current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.</td>\n",

On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike \"over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide\". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed \"severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower\". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to \"cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS\". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent \"lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be\", but has nonetheless \"chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week\". This means \"forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily\". The students are \"risking their health and education\" in order to push the university to \"sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East\". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a \"facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing\".

Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as – without insurance – Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' – despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's \"principle institutional shareholder\", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the \"soup throwers\" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people – if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were \"the highest of their kind in modern British history\". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a \"paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing\". The court was told the protesters \"acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted\", but \"none of the applicants acted out of self-interest\". Mr Friedman said: \"What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations.\" \"They did what they did out of sacrifice,\" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.   \n",
       "3  The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament – even with high economic growth – if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living – social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change – meaningful change to people's lives – is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net.

       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety​. The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at £12,300. This translates to an estimated £42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the £28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every £1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains £1.48 in wellbeing benefits​. Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him \"a new life\". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence​. Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety​. In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need​. The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms​. As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining—and even expanding—current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.   \n",

       "      <td>International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to \"Syrian authorities\" for \"open &amp; constructive discussions\" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Exclusive — Senate Sources: FBI, Senate Democrats Reason for Tulsi Gabbard’s Slow-Walked Confirmation</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Donald Trump in his inauguration speech on Monday unequivocally rejected the gender insanity pushed by the Biden administration over the past four years. The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify \"gender identity\" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. \"With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. \"And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school.\" \"And, we will keep men out of women's sports,\" Trump added. \"And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one? Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government, that there are only two genders, male and female.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Javier Milei Condemns Brazil for Keeping Bolsonaro from Trump Inauguration</td>\n",
       "      <td>President of Argentina Javier Milei blamed the \"regime\" of Brazilian radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for not allowing conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro to travel to the United States for the inauguration of President Donald Trump. \"He [Bolsonaro] is my friend. I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,\" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged \"coup\" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled \"anti-fake news crusader\" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a \"flight risk\" and that he showed \"indications\" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was \"upset\" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. \"It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,\" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a \"blatant persecution\" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing \"whatever he wants\" with the intention of \"eliminating\" Brazil's right wing. \"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,\" Bolsonaro said. \"They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world.\" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a \"historic partner\" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. \"There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,\" Lula said. On Sunday, Eduardo Bolsonaro published a video on his Instagram account of former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro holding a video call with Jair Bolsonaro while she participated in a dinner on the eve of January 20.

Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. \"Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,\" Trump said. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\" He continued, \"First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\" Trump will go even further. \"Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,\" he said. \"And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\" \"As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" Trump said. \"We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\"</td>\n",

       "0  International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to \"Syrian authorities\" for \"open & constructive discussions\" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.   \n",

Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.   \n",

The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify \"gender identity\" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. \"With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. \"And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school.\" \"And, we will keep men out of women's sports,\" Trump added. \"And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one? Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government, that there are only two genders, male and female.\"   \n",

I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,\" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged \"coup\" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled \"anti-fake news crusader\" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a \"flight risk\" and that he showed \"indications\" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was \"upset\" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. \"It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,\" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a \"blatant persecution\" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing \"whatever he wants\" with the intention of \"eliminating\" Brazil's right wing. \"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,\" Bolsonaro said. \"They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world.\" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a \"historic partner\" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. \"There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,\" Lula said.

Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. \"Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,\" Trump said. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\" He continued, \"First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\" Trump will go even further. \"Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,\" he said. \"And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\" \"As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" Trump said. \"We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\"   \n",
