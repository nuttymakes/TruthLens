    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of four categories, based on an adaption of Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 400 pieces of content for each of the 4 categories. The 4 categories chosen are: fabricated content, polarised content, satire, commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|*Misreporting* | *Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification.* | *A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.*|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|*Persuasive information* |*Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda.* |*Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.*|\n",
    "|*Citizen journalism* | *User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias.* |*Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.*|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites or sources for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below. "

One whistleblower, insisting on anonymity, described the council’s gatherings as “a blend of high-level intrigue and covert power plays,” where a handful of elite figures shape world events.

One supposed insider explained that the Directorate’s ultimate goal is to monopolize global healthcare, ensuring that all new treatments funnel profits exclusively to a handful of powerful corporations.

Nonetheless, the legend of The Phantom Thief continues to capture the imagination of both criminals and crime enthusiasts.\", \"crime\" ],\n",
    "    [\"The Cyber Syndicate and the Digital Black Market\", \"A series of posts on dark web forums has recently brought attention to an alleged cyber syndicate that is said to run an expansive digital black market, controlling vast networks of hackers and cybercriminals. According to the entirely fabricated narrative, this syndicate—known only as “Digital Dominion”—is responsible for orchestrating large-scale data breaches, identity thefts, and even orchestrated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The story details how Digital Dominion supposedly recruits skilled hackers from around the globe, providing them with state-of-the-art tools and secretive training in return for a share of their illicit profits. Leaked “evidence” in the form of anonymized chat logs and cryptic online transactions has fueled speculation about the syndicate’s influence over modern cybercrime. Despite the dramatic claims, no law enforcement agency has confirmed the existence of such an organization, and cybersecurity experts have dismissed the narrative as a myth designed to instill fear. Nevertheless, the notion of a centralized cybercriminal empire continues to spread rapidly among online communities, adding fuel to debates about digital security.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"Fake Evidence Links Celebrity to Crime Ring\", \" scandalous claim has emerged from questionable online sources alleging that a world-renowned celebrity is secretly involved in an international crime ring. According to the fabricated report, the star—whose identity remains deliberately vague—has been linked through a series of doctored documents, manipulated photographs, and untraceable phone recordings to an underground network involved in money laundering and arms trafficking. The narrative suggests that the celebrity’s public persona is merely a facade, carefully crafted to conceal a far more sinister involvement in organized crime. Despite the sensational nature of the claim, independent investigations by reputable outlets have found no supporting evidence, and multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked the story as a fabrication. Nonetheless, the tale has ignited fervent debate on social media, with supporters insisting that the “evidence” is being suppressed by powerful interests intent on protecting high-profile figures. Critics argue that the entire narrative is a calculated piece of misinformation designed to smear reputations and distract from real criminal investigations.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Underworld’s Hidden Code of Silence\", \"Whispers from the criminal underworld have given rise to a fabricated narrative detailing an alleged secret code of silence that binds organized crime groups across continents. According to the entirely unverified account, this so-called “Code of Shadows” mandates that members of illicit organizations adhere to strict rules of non-disclosure about their operations, with severe—and entirely invented—consequences for any breaches. Leaked “testimonies” from anonymous ex-criminals (whose identities cannot be confirmed) claim that this code is enforced through a network of vigilante enforcers operating outside the law. The report further asserts that this clandestine system has allowed crime syndicates to thrive, coordinating complex operations such as international drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and high-stakes robberies without fear of exposure. While law enforcement officials have long acknowledged the existence of informal codes among criminals, no evidence has ever substantiated the detailed version of the Code of Shadows described in these posts. Nevertheless, the story has captured the public’s imagination, fueling both fear and fascination with the hidden rules of the underworld.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"Alleged Supernatural Connection in Organized Crime\", \"In a bizarre twist that has stirred both intrigue and skepticism, unverified online sources claim that an otherworldly element is at work within organized crime circles. According to this fabricated narrative, certain notorious crime families are rumored to have forged secret pacts with mysterious, supernatural entities in exchange for uncanny success in their illicit endeavors. The story describes eerie rituals performed in abandoned warehouses under moonlit skies, where members of these crime families allegedly invoke ancient forces to secure their power and evade capture by authorities. Detailed but entirely fictional accounts include descriptions of cryptic symbols, mysterious chants, and inexplicable phenomena witnessed during criminal operations. While no credible evidence or expert testimony supports any supernatural involvement in crime, the tale has rapidly spread through niche internet forums and alternative news sites. Skeptics dismiss the narrative as pure fantasy, yet its persistence highlights the human tendency to weave extraordinary explanations around the most enigmatic and frightening aspects of criminal life.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"AI-Driven Vote Rigging Uncovered\", \"A startling claim emerging from shadowy online sources alleges that recent elections in multiple countries were manipulated using advanced artificial intelligence systems designed specifically for vote rigging. According to the entirely fabricated report, an underground network of tech experts and political operatives developed a sophisticated AI program that could alter digital ballots and even sway public opinion through targeted disinformation campaigns. Leaked “internal communications” (all of which lack any credible origin) detail how this system was deployed during key electoral cycles to produce results favorable to a select group of political elites. The report asserts that the AI not only manipulated vote counts but also fabricated evidence of voter fraud to justify its interference. While election officials and independent watchdog organizations have vehemently denied any involvement of AI in vote manipulation, the narrative has ignited fierce debates online. Critics dismiss the allegations as modern myth-making, yet the idea of a clandestine, algorithm-driven election interference continues to find an audience among those distrusting traditional democratic processes.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"Hidden Ballots and Phantom Voters\", \"In a narrative that has rapidly spread through fringe political blogs, unverified sources now claim that a secretive scheme involving hidden ballots and phantom voters was implemented during recent national elections. According to the fabricated account, shadow operatives allegedly inserted fake ballots into the voting system, and entirely fictitious voter identities were created to sway the outcome in key districts. Detailed but entirely false “evidence”—including manipulated voter records and doctored official documents—purports to show that thousands of non-existent citizens were added to the rolls, tipping the scales in favor of a prearranged result. The story asserts that these phantom voters were registered using advanced data manipulation techniques, and that the entire operation was coordinated from undisclosed headquarters by a covert group of political insiders. While election authorities have consistently maintained that voter registration and ballot counting were conducted transparently and accurately, the rumor of hidden ballots and ghost voters continues to spark controversy. Skeptics warn that such narratives are dangerous fabrications intended to undermine public confidence in democratic institutions.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Secret Software Behind Election Fraud\", \"A fabricated exposé circulating on alternative news platforms alleges that the integrity of recent elections was compromised by secret software embedded in voting machines. According to the entirely unverified report, a rogue group of software engineers collaborated with political operatives to install a hidden program capable of altering vote totals in real time. Detailed descriptions in the report claim that the software was designed to target specific precincts and switch votes from opposition candidates to those favored by the conspirators. Anonymous “insiders” (whose identities remain unverifiable) provided screenshots and technical schematics to support the claim, though none have been authenticated by independent experts. Election officials have categorically denied any tampering with voting equipment, yet the narrative persists among groups that already harbor deep suspicions of electoral fraud. While mainstream media and cybersecurity professionals dismiss the allegations as a digital-age urban legend, the story has fueled ongoing debates about the security and transparency of modern voting systems.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"International Conspiracy Alters Poll Results\", \"A sensational claim has emerged from obscure online communities alleging that an international conspiracy was behind the manipulation of poll results in recent elections. According to this fabricated narrative, a coalition of foreign intelligence agencies and political operatives conspired to alter vote tallies through covert operations, including hacking voting systems and deploying disinformation campaigns across borders. The report—supported by entirely unsubstantiated “leaked” documents and cryptic video footage—purports to show that the conspiracy was orchestrated from hidden command centers located in various parts of the world. Proponents of the story argue that the altered results were part of a larger plan to undermine national sovereignty and install puppet governments. Despite repeated denials from official election commissions and independent international observers, the narrative continues to gain traction among segments of the public already inclined to distrust electoral processes. Experts, however, maintain that there is no credible evidence of any such international interference, calling the story a complete fabrication designed to stoke geopolitical paranoia.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Unseen Hand Steering Democracy\", \"In a final explosive installment of fabricated election conspiracies, unverified online sources claim that an unseen hand has been subtly steering democratic outcomes for decades. According to the entirely fictitious report, a secret cabal of influential figures—including undisclosed political advisors, wealthy oligarchs, and covert intelligence operatives—has been manipulating voter sentiment and election results from behind the scenes. Detailed accounts in the report describe how this cabal allegedly funds political campaigns, engineers media narratives, and even tampers with ballot-counting machines to ensure desired outcomes. The narrative is supported by a series of dubious “eyewitness” testimonies and manipulated documents that purport to reveal a long-standing pattern of covert intervention in democratic processes. While election experts and historians have long refuted such sweeping claims, the story of an unseen hand controlling the destiny of nations continues to resonate with those disillusioned by modern politics. Critics argue that the tale is a carefully constructed piece of misinformation intended to erode public trust in the very foundations of democracy.\", \"elections\" ]\n",

Public consciousness of child sexual exploitation in the United Kingdom reached an inflection point this winter after victims shared account after gut-churning account of sexual savagery and careless murder being perpetrated against underage white girls by Pakistani-Muslim men up and down the country. These brave survivors recount how police and social workers were complicit in their abuse, losing evidence, asserting that children could consent , and failing to investigate rapes for fear of being called racist. In one instance, a girl had a morning-after pill forced into her mouth by a police officer . Significant constituencies of the public believe that attempts are being made to cover up the historic failures of both local and national authorities, including 65% of Labour voters. These accusations of corruption, galvanised by high-profile political figures like Elon Musk, have been branded ' far-right' by Keir Starmer, which has only caused the public's attention to shift toward the prime minister and his record as Director of Public Prosecutions . The prime minister fueled speculations of a cover-up when he issued a three-line party whip--the most stringent form of party discipline--against Labour MPs, forcing them to vote against the investigation or risk expulsion from the party. When the vote came, therefore, MPs from the top 50 towns known to be sheltering grooming gangs either abstained or voted against the investigation. Only 3 MPs living in these grooming gang hotspots favoured an investigation. In each instance, the member came from the Conservative Party. No Labour MP voted in favour of an investigation, with around one-fifth abstaining or absent. The result produced a seismic backlash, including from angry victims , in whose names Labour claimed a national investigation would be counterproductive to change. The party line is, \"The investigation has already been had\" and \"It is time to get to work.\" This has proven to be one of these sleight-of-hand truths intended to cover all manner of sins. As Reform MP Nigel Farage highlighted for the House, this preexisting inquiry--all 459 pages of it--fails to mention \"grooming gangs\" and of the over 50 towns in England known to be harbouring this scourge, only the infamous Rotherham is mentioned. It is thought that the number of girls who have been victims of child sexual exploitation, sexual assault, and rape by these gangs could be a quarter of a million--at the most conservative estimate. In twelve months alone, a Grooming Gangs Taskforce helped UK police identify and protect \"over 4,000 victims.\" The towering ambiguity of just how many girls have been affected should, alone, give cause for a comprehensive, rigorous, and far-reaching investigation. The need is unambiguous and the public mandate is indisputable. Some within the Labour Party are coming to this realisation. MPs have begun to break ranks to side with the opposition in calling for an investigation, including Dan Carden , Paul Waugh , and Sarah Champion --MPs for the infamous Rochdale and Rotherham. But the cynic in me believes this limp 'I am Spartacus'-moment struggles to amount to more than career protection. I do not believe there is the desire or the passion to put an end to the ritual rape of these girls by gangs of foreign men. For decades, MPs have had their eyes wide shut to this scourge. The cold, unfeeling truth is that these girls have been dismissed because their abuse is a political inconvenience. The facts of this atrocity contradict the tenets of 'inclusivity' and 'tolerance' that characterise our modern age. From infancy until death, the public is schooled that diversity is--and can only ever be--a strength. If an immigrant living in a Western nation engages in criminal or grotesque behaviour, he does not reflect the customs and attitudes of his home nation. Nor is he to be included in the ranks of the 'DiverseTM'. He is to be viewed as an innocent--a child--lashing out at a cruel and misunderstanding people. Whether he emerges from a war zone or a paradise, he is to be understood as suffering an impenetrable trauma that gifts rationality to his barbarity. All of which is to say, it is impossible for one to identify a pattern of perversity in any one community, religion, country, or culture. It is in this vein that the British public is charged to ignore the demographic shift in their constituencies--ignore how this might influence a politician's vote. They are forbidden from noticing that the fast-food economy which sustains the middle-class lifestyle also sustains the perpetrators in these rape gangs. They must blind themselves to the incontrovertible. Labour is no longer the party of the white working class because the white, working-class vote is no longer useful to them.It is not the rape of the nation's children the UK Government is trying to cover up, nor is it the endemic failures in local councils and child protection services. What they wish to deny is an attitude: that the life of a white, working-class girl--much like her consent--is surplus to requirements.   \n",
      "1  In July 2023, an Iranian man burned copies of the Bible and Torah outside the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen. The Danish authorities granted Medhi Zaman permission, and the demonstration was mostly disregarded by the general public. However, in both Denmark and Sweden, insulting Islam is treated differently. Last month, Salwan Momika, an Iraqi asylum seeker living in Sweden, was awaiting trial for a series of public burnings of the Quran. The 38-year-old anti-Islam activist did not attend court because, on January 29th, Momika was shot dead in what appears to be a retaliatory attack. Although Momika's protest is supposedly protected under Swedish law--the country scrapped its blasphemy laws in 1970--exceptions are made if the protest is viewed as incitement. He was awaiting a verdict on a charge of 'agitation against an ethnic group.' The protest sparked outrage in muslim-Majority countries. The Scandinavian Quran burnings were cited by Turkey as why they delayed Sweden's NATO membership for months. The Swedish embassy in Baghdad was attacked and its ambassador was expelled. Denmark was once a shining example of Enlightenment rationalism. When the government abolished all types of censorship in 1770, it asserted its citizens' right to free speech. This was demonstrated when it vigorously defended Jyllands-Posten , a Danish newspaper that published a dozen satirical cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in 2005. Despite the potential backlash and the threat to life, the administration remained steadfast in its protection of journalistic freedom.Things have changed, and it appears that certain accommodations have been made for Islam. In response to a series of book burnings, the country introduced what is widely referred to as \"t he Quran law \" in December 2023. Those who burn or defile holy texts face a fine and a maximum sentence of two years in prison. In January, two Danish citizens were the first to be charged under the new law. Both were accused of 'inappropriate treatment of a Quran' at a political festival in June of last year. Despite the European Court of Human Rights having stressed on numerous occasions that freedom of expression constitutes \"one of the essential foundations of a democratic society\", and that \"it is applicable not only to 'information' or 'ideas' that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population,\" there are still several EU members states that still punish 'insult to religion,' as noted on the website of End Blasphemy Laws. Britain has also formally abolished its blasphemy laws. However, the police's attitude towards those who ridicule Islam's holy book has remained mostly unchanged since 2008, when blasphemy was removed from the statute books. Last month, a man in Manchester was arrested on suspicion of a 'racially aggravated public order offence' after live-streaming himself burning a Quran. Then, just a few days ago, Metropolitan police charged a man with the same offence after a Quran was allegedly burned outside the Turkish consulate in central London, despite the activist being attacked by a man wielding a knife who objected to his protest and reportedly spat on him. In 2023, an autistic 14-year-old boy was suspended from a school in West Yorkshire when a copy of the Quran was scuffed. So great was the anger in the local Muslim community that the boy's mother appeared at a local mosque begging for forgiveness after his life was threatened. To compound the humiliation, her 'sinful' hair was covered to avoid any offending worshippers. The Batley Grammar School teacher who drew the wrath of Muslims in 2021 for displaying his students an illustration of the prophet Mohammed is allegedly still in hiding. When Labour MP Tahir Ali urged Sir Keir Starmer to prohibit the desecration of the Quran and other Abrahamic religious texts during Prime Minister's questions, it was obvious which faith he was talking about. Ali is ideologically captured by the electorate--57.5% of Ali's Birmingham constituency of Hall Green and Moseley are Muslim. Between 2011 and 2021, the Muslim population of England and Wales increased by more than a million, reaching almost 4 million, or approximately 6.5% of the population, and is estimated to rise to 17.2% by 2050. In response to Ali's proposal for a law to safeguard Islam from mockery, Prime Minister Starmer stated: \"I agree that desecration is awful and should be condemned across the House. We are ... committed to tackling all forms of hatred and division, including Islamophobia in all its forms.\" Our ruling class's support for state-mandated multiculturalism has culminated in the creation of a new de facto blasphemy law: Islamophobia. During its time in opposition, the Labour Party adopted the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims (APPG) definition of Islamophobia, a version of which looks likely to be implemented by the government, according to the Sunday Telegraph . An APPG report defined it thus: \"Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.\" Following a string of Quran burnings in Scandinavia, the Guardian described the stunts as evidence of a 'racism crisis.' One of the Muslim women interviewed called book burning an example of 'Islamophobia.' However, Islam is a belief system, not a race. There are nearly two billion Muslims in the world, many of whom come from different ethnicities. When you criticise Islam, you are criticising an ideology, not a specific racial group: conflating race and ideas is an efficient technique to silence opposition. The real problem for Europe is definitely not imaginary Islamophobia, but Islam itself. Many convincingly argue that Islam is a religion that is inherently opposed to Western values. This was also evidenced by a survey done in March of last year: 52% of Muslims in the United Kingdom support legislation outlawing the display of images of the Prophet Mohammed within the next twenty years. If you live in the West, you must adhere to its laws and values. If this means tolerating somebody burning a religious text, then so be it. Living in a free society demands a trade-off. However, European countries, once the foundation of enlightenment thinking, have opened their borders and collectively accepted the censorious demands of Islam. Britain--the birthplace of liberty philosopher and advocate John Milton--has a long history of liberty, free expression, and the right to blaspheme. But after importing large numbers of people from countries with dictatorships or theocratic regimes, we seem to be forced to give up on these historically European principles.   \n",

Few of them have been as unusual as the one U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivered last Friday. Much of the audience, composed of high-ranking politicians and experts from EU and NATO countries, expected detailed policy outlines on transatlantic security and the war in Ukraine. But Vance focused on the basics, the common heritage, freedom, free speech, and true democracy. Although not many in the audience may have been receptive to these messages, there is certainly a growing number of people in Europe who are willing to work with the backbone, the patriots, the \" hillbillies \" of America on these fundamentals: the conservative sovereigntist forces of Europe such as the Patriots for Europe. What do these values have to do with geopolitics and security? Everything. They point to three main principles that unite the new American and European conservative movements: faith, national sovereignty, and peace through strength. Patriots on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that our values are ultimately rooted in the principles of our Western civilization, in our faith, in our Christian heritage. It is the most cherished value to be preserved. Because of its uniqueness, Patriots do not believe that any other culture or nation outside the West should or could apply all of our values, principles, or laws. We take it for granted that all men are created equal--it's a Christian idea, after all--but we have learned the lessons of our own recent history about the dangers and costs of \" searching for monsters overseas ,\" even when doing so in the name of liberal democratic values. Patriots believe that we are in this world to have a home somewhere, to be part of a nation. National sovereignty is about solidarity and inclusion. The nation-state is the largest and most successful community of peoples bound together by common history, culture, and norms. When people question the value of the nation and either fantasize about globalist universalism or try to transcend national boundaries with imperial ambitions, they always end in disaster. Faith and national sovereignty recognize the realities of this world. America first, Europe first, Italy first, Hungary first also means that our interests in security, economics, and trade sometimes differ. But despite the critics, at their core, today's patriots have much more respect for other nations than liberal Western elites because they understand the fundamental value of national sovereignty. Finally, peace through strength. Patriots recognize power as the driver of international politics, so they see strong defense and deterrence as a necessity. At the same time, deterrence is enhanced not only by military strength, but also by clearly defining the boundaries of our genuine fundamental interests based on proper risk and cost assessments. Fighting endless unwinnable wars only undermines deterrence. As the Cold War taught us in the Koreas or Vietnam, winning the peace is sometimes more important than winning the war. The West faces daunting challenges. There is much common ground on both sides of the Atlantic among those who believe that the West needs a new kind of Reformation--one that looks boldly to the future, nourished by the wellsprings of original truths. At a recent meeting of the Patriots, Prime Minister Viktor Orban quoted another famous Hungarian, Ferenc Puskas, the greatest soccer player of all time, referring to conservative forces in Europe, \"The team is very much together.\" When it comes to bold and powerful solutions in the Western political arena, an American quarterback in the team could change the name of the game for the better.   \n",

       "      <td>Three in four people in Britain polled support a national inquiry into the prolific and harrowing rape of the nation's children by insatiate \" grooming gangs .\" Yet, contrary to public will, the UK Labour Government last week voted against commissioning an investigation into this enduring horror. Public consciousness of child sexual exploitation in the United Kingdom reached an inflection point this winter after victims shared account after gut-churning account of sexual savagery and careless murder being perpetrated against underage white girls by Pakistani-Muslim men up and down the country. These brave survivors recount how police and social workers were complicit in their abuse, losing evidence, asserting that children could consent , and failing to investigate rapes for fear of being called racist. In one instance, a girl had a morning-after pill forced into her mouth by a police officer . Significant constituencies of the public believe that attempts are being made to cover up the historic failures of both local and national authorities, including 65% of Labour voters. These accusations of corruption, galvanised by high-profile political figures like Elon Musk, have been branded ' far-right' by Keir Starmer, which has only caused the public's attention to shift toward the prime minister and his record as Director of Public Prosecutions . The prime minister fueled speculations of a cover-up when he issued a three-line party whip--the most stringent form of party discipline--against Labour MPs, forcing them to vote against the investigation or risk expulsion from the party. When the vote came, therefore, MPs from the top 50 towns known to be sheltering grooming gangs either abstained or voted against the investigation. Only 3 MPs living in these grooming gang hotspots favoured an investigation. In each instance, the member came from the Conservative Party. No Labour MP voted in favour of an investigation, with around one-fifth abstaining or absent. The result produced a seismic backlash, including from angry victims , in whose names Labour claimed a national investigation would be counterproductive to change. The party line is, \"The investigation has already been had\" and \"It is time to get to work.\" This has proven to be one of these sleight-of-hand truths intended to cover all manner of sins. As Reform MP Nigel Farage highlighted for the House, this preexisting inquiry--all 459 pages of it--fails to mention \"grooming gangs\" and of the over 50 towns in England known to be harbouring this scourge, only the infamous Rotherham is mentioned. It is thought that the number of girls who have been victims of child sexual exploitation, sexual assault, and rape by these gangs could be a quarter of a million--at the most conservative estimate. In twelve months alone, a Grooming Gangs Taskforce helped UK police identify and protect \"over 4,000 victims.\" The towering ambiguity of just how many girls have been affected should, alone, give cause for a comprehensive, rigorous, and far-reaching investigation. The need is unambiguous and the public mandate is indisputable. Some within the Labour Party are coming to this realisation. MPs have begun to break ranks to side with the opposition in calling for an investigation, including Dan Carden , Paul Waugh , and Sarah Champion --MPs for the infamous Rochdale and Rotherham. But the cynic in me believes this limp 'I am Spartacus'-moment struggles to amount to more than career protection. I do not believe there is the desire or the passion to put an end to the ritual rape of these girls by gangs of foreign men. For decades, MPs have had their eyes wide shut to this scourge. The cold, unfeeling truth is that these girls have been dismissed because their abuse is a political inconvenience. The facts of this atrocity contradict the tenets of 'inclusivity' and 'tolerance' that characterise our modern age. From infancy until death, the public is schooled that diversity is--and can only ever be--a strength. If an immigrant living in a Western nation engages in criminal or grotesque behaviour, he does not reflect the customs and attitudes of his home nation. Nor is he to be included in the ranks of the 'DiverseTM'. He is to be viewed as an innocent--a child--lashing out at a cruel and misunderstanding people. Whether he emerges from a war zone or a paradise, he is to be understood as suffering an impenetrable trauma that gifts rationality to his barbarity. All of which is to say, it is impossible for one to identify a pattern of perversity in any one community, religion, country, or culture. It is in this vein that the British public is charged to ignore the demographic shift in their constituencies--ignore how this might influence a politician's vote. They are forbidden from noticing that the fast-food economy which sustains the middle-class lifestyle also sustains the perpetrators in these rape gangs. They must blind themselves to the incontrovertible. Labour is no longer the party of the white working class because the white, working-class vote is no longer useful to them.It is not the rape of the nation's children the UK Government is trying to cover up, nor is it the endemic failures in local councils and child protection services. What they wish to deny is an attitude: that the life of a white, working-class girl--much like her consent--is surplus to requirements.</td>\n",

       "      <td>G et right down to it and there are two reasons for thinking that cuts to Britain's aid budget to pay for defence are a seriously bad idea. The first is that people will die as a result. There will be less money to respond to humanitarian crises and less money for vaccination programmes and hospitals. Realpolitik is being blamed for the decision, but realpolitik doesn't make it right. But there are also economic arguments for rich countries providing financial support to less well-off nations, which were summed up succinctly in last year's Labour party manifesto . This document could not have been clearer. International assistance, it said, helps make \"the world a safer, more prosperous place\". That remains as true as it was when Labour came to power last summer, and indeed it was still the party's stated belief a month ago. When, as one of his first decisions, Donald Trump gutted the US aid budget, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it could be a \" big strategic mistake \". Now that the UK has followed suit and reduced aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national output, Lammy says it was a difficult but pragmatic decision. He was right before and is wrong now. At its crudest, the economic case for overseas aid is that it is good for business. As countries become richer, they provide export opportunities for donor countries. The US has always understood this, with postwar Marshall aid for European reconstruction in part driven by fear of the spread of communism and in part as a means to provide markets for US goods. Under previous administrations, US humanitarian aid programmes have channelled agricultural surpluses into overseas food programmes. In today's world, it is no longer possible to think of aid spending and defence spending as discrete pots of money. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in those parts of the world most seriously damaged by wars and the climate crisis. Five years ago, the global economy was about to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a shock from which the UK has yet to recover. Ministers need to ask themselves a simple question: does cutting the aid budget make another worldwide health emergency more or less likely? Poor countries need help to boost economic development more than ever. They havebeen hard hit by the double whammy of Covid and the higher food prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. A new debt crisis is looming, and both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been warning that money that could and should be spent on schools, hospitals and building protection against the effects of the climate emergency is instead being spent paying back creditors. The Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown spearheaded previous debt relief efforts and were able to do so because Britain showed a strong commitment to overseas assistance. A new Department for International Development was set up, a goal was set of meeting the UN aid target of 0.7% of national income, and there was a clear gameplan. Spending more on aid was good for poor countries, but it was also good for rich countries such as Britain. It was a classic example of the exercise of soft power. Britain punched well above its weight when development issues were discussed at the IMF and World Bank. The world is a lot more fragile and divided than it was in the early years of this century, when growth was strong and the era of financial crises and global pandemics was still in the future. With the US and China locked in a battle for economic supremacy, the battle is on to capture hearts and minds. Seen in this context, the UK's decision to follow the US lead on aid spending is shortsighted. It will merely make poor countries more susceptible to offers of assistance from Beijing. None of which is to say that every penny of aid is well spent. Yes, there is waste, as there is with defence spending. But in making the choice it has, the government has effectively bought into the rightwing argument that aid does more harm than good and traps poor people into a dependency culture. Labour needs to be careful. The right says the same about the welfare state, which will be next on its list of targets. There is a case for higher defence spending. It is a more dangerous world and Britain can no longer rely on the US to provide guaranteed military support. But let's be clear. The reason the aid budget is being cut to pay for the armed forces is not because it is the best way to raise money but because it is the easiest. The government is calculating that it will get far less grief from voters - especially Labour voters flirting with Reform UK - this way. There are alternatives. Rachel Reeves could increase taxes on the wealthy. If the need is really as urgent as the government says, then the chancellor could justify borrowing more. A truly progressive government would be reviving the idea of a Robin Hood tax on speculative financial transactions to meet its manifesto pledge of raising aid spending back to 0.7% of national income. Instead, Starmer has done the reverse of a Robin Hood tax. Shamefully, he is balancing the books courtesy of the poorest people in the world. This will not make the world a safer and more prosperous place. The exact opposite, in fact.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Price Gouging in the L.A. Housing Market Is Now Rampant. Can We Stop It?</td>\n",
       "      <td>The wildfires in Los Angeles are devastating. Forty thousand acres of natural and urban land have been scorched, more than 12,300 structures decimated, and tens of thousands of families lost their homes, pets, baby books, and most cherished possessions. The displaced are now fanning out, seeking temporary shelter with friends and family, in hotels, or in rental units. Many will have trouble finding a place to stay in a city that was already as many as 450,000 affordable units short before the fires. When there are more heads than beds, it's a seller's market. When there are more heads than beds in a crisis, it's a gouger's market. Cue the greedy landlords. In the past week, the price of rental units has skyrocketed. Tenants are inundating government and non-government agencies with complaints of price gouging, according to the Housing Rights Center . A review of Zillow listings by The New York Times found that rent prices in West Los Angeles have spiked from 15 percent to an \"eye-popping 64 percent.\" And residents have begun cataloging an ever-growing list of inexplicably large price spikes in a jaw-dropping Google Sheet , a veritable rogue's gallery of tenant exploitation, broken down by street address. According to the list, a one bedroom townhome outside Jefferson Park jumped from $900 to $2,300 . Another in downtown Los Angeles (one of the few listings that does allow pets) spiked from $1,095 to $3,200 . A five-bed, five-bath near Brentwood Heights went from $12,000 to $15,000. When asked about the shocking rent hikes, an L.A.-area listing agent offered the most-commonly invoked defense of price gouging: it was just \" supply and demand \" at work. Unfortunately, this type of price gouging after natural disasters is all too common. Early in the pandemic, price gouging on masks, hand sanitizer, respirators, and clorox wipes was rampant. After Hurricane Harvey, the Texas attorney general reported an instance of gougers charging a whopping $99 for a case of water . This is why the majority of states -- including California -- have price gouging laws on the books. These laws are designed to protect consumers when the markets may be impacted by natural disasters, pandemics, or other disruptions, like supply chain shocks -- but they are only as good as their enforcers. Area residents are reporting price hikes that far exceed California's 10-percent threshold for price gouging. Lawmakers must work quickly to crack down on these predators, and make an example of some of the worst offenders. It is good to see that California Governor Gavin Newsom has extended price - gouging protections for rental housing through March, and that California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced his office will be ramping up resources to investigate and prosecute offenders. Even if they act fast, it won't be enough. Because the problem is bigger than the greedy landlords. The private equity vultures have also descended on the Hollywood Hills, and begun sifting through the rubble, looking to see what they might be able to acquire in a fire sale. Real estate agents are calling for the city to suspend its new \" mansion tax ,\" which applies to deals over $5 million, and last year raised $375 million for affordable housing -- a duck call for investors and corporate landlords looking to expand their footprint in the rental market. In a letter , realtors argued, \"Exempting developers from the transfer tax for five years will encourage them to purchase land from homeowners at reasonable prices and quickly rebuild these devastated communities.\" Suspending the mansion tax will starve the city of the resources it needs to rebuild the affordable housing units displaced families require. It is the opposite of what policymakers should do to meet this moment. Now is the perfect time to show Angelenos why they passed this legislation in the first place, using the proceeds to deliver affordable housing on an expedited timeline that matches the urgency of this crisis. Lawmakers can look to the recent successes of Executive Directive 1, which streamlined some permitting for affordable units, as a roadmap. And while residents wait for additional housing to come online, policymakers should extend price gouging protections to renters through at least the end of 2025, and prohibit application fees, credit check fees, and other junk fees that drive up the total cost of rent during this period as well. Crises like natural disasters expose and widen the existing fault lines in our economy and our public policy. Rent gouging after a wildfire is galling, but the hard truth is that every day, across this country, tenants are exploited by a housing system that is failing them. Even before the wildfires, our country was facing a severe housing affordability crisis, driven in part by corporate landlords working to extract as much as they can from us and our neighbors. The lack of affordable housing across the country, and in major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles in particular, leaves us vulnerable to the whims of landlords. Private equity's deepening penetration into the residential real estate market only exacerbates this power imbalance. This dynamic shows no sign of abating as President Trump's new nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development extolled the virtues of private equity at his confirmation hearing this week. If we want to stop the vultures from circling, we must build a housing system that can not only withstand dangerous weather, but also the dangers of an economy that makes a fair price for rent increasingly elusive.

       "      <td>It bears repeating over and over: the science is not in question. High concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are warming the planet. International law is also clear: under the legally binding Paris climate agreement, nations pledged to keep average temperatures within 1.5 degC of pre-industrial levels. And yet, as emissions continue to increase, global temperature rises will almost certainly exceed this limit . The research community is frustrated that its warnings are not being heeded. What is the point of a legally binding agreement if countries can effectively ignore it? Some scientists are arguing that climate researchers need to become climate activists, too 1 , 2 . But others, and more than a few governments, are not giving up on the legal route. Because the Paris agreement lacks an enforcement mechanism, they want courts to ensure that all those with climate responsibility -- nationally and internationally -- can be held to their promises. And they have been busy going to court. By the end of last year, 2,666 climate-litigation cases had been filed worldwide, according to a report 3 by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, published in June (see 'Climate in court'). Most claimants are individuals , young and old, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). All are looking to hold governments and companies accountable for their climate pledges. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4 acknowledged that , if successful, climate litigation \"can lead to an increase in a country's overall ambition to tackle climate change\". Note the phrase, \"if successful\". There have been a handful of landmark judgments. For example, in May, courts in Germany and the United Kingdom separately found that their government's policies would fail to meet emissions-reduction targets that are set out in law. But most claimants struggle to get a positive result, as Joana Setzer and Catherine Higham, researchers at the Grantham Institute in London, show in their report 3 . Much climate litigation is mired in a maze of process and procedure. In some instances, respondents -- mostly corporations -- are embarking on counter-litigation, essentially challenging climate laws that they do not like. This is where the entry of the world's highest court could be a game changer. In the next few months, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations' principal judicial organ in The Hague, the Netherlands, will begin hearing evidence on two broad questions: first, what are countries' obligations in international law to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, and second, what should the legal consequences be for states when their actions -- or failure to act -- cause harm? The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature This could be one of the most consequential developments in climate policy since the Paris agreement itself. Adil Najam, president of the global conservation NGO WWF, writes in a World View that the ICJ's opinion \"will amplify the voices of millions of scientists and citizens who are demanding strong ambition and action on climate and nature protection\". These voices include people arguing against greenwashing, or for the protection from climate change as a human right , as well as public authorities seeking compensation from corporations for climate-related harms, under the 'polluter pays' principle. Last September, California launched legal action against five of the world's largest oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell -- and their subsidiaries, demanding that they pay \"for the costs of their impacts to the environment, human health and Californians' livelihoods, and to help protect the state against the harms that climate change will cause in years to come\". Brazil's public prosecutor's office and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources are seeking compensation for harms specifically from greenhouse-gas emissions caused by illegal deforestation 5 . The ICJ's opinion, although non-binding, will be especially important for low- and middle-income countries, which have comparatively less access to expertise in climate science, policy and law than do high-income countries. One criticism of climate litigation states that courts should not be getting involved in what are essentially political processes. The argument is that, if climate laws lack an enforcement mechanism, then governments need to legislate for one. According to this idea, it shouldn't be up to the courts to do something that is the job of governments; that would be judicial overreach. Courts are well aware of these concerns, and the ICJ will be, too. Legal redress is but one tool in a larger toolbox of actions. Ultimately, climate action at scale and pace will happen only when the international community is persuaded that humanity has no alternative but to decarbonize in a just way; not because of the threat of prosecutions, but because our collective survival depends on it. But the law has a key role. And the ICJ's opinion, backed by the highest standards of evidence, will be necessary in clarifying states' responsibility for climate harms and their obligation to protect the environment from emissions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As one who shared the hope, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, that representative government , guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections would spread across the globe, I naturally look back over the intervening long generation and ask what went wrong. In the 1990s, it seemed to many that the vision of Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man would prevail. Not that bad things would never happen again. Fukuyama's more subtle thesis was that after the debacle of communism, there was no intellectually viable alternative to some combination of political democracy and market capitalism as the means to a decent society. But the past three decades have seen the vitality of politically viable alternatives -- China's dictatorial and Russia's authoritarian state-directed capitalism, the oppressive clerical regimes of Shiite Iran, and various Sunni Muslim states. By Freedom House's sophisticated measures , 2004 saw a high point in global freedom, which has been in decline ever since. How to explain this trend, the opposite of what I hoped for and predicted? As I have reflected on this question, I've fallen back on an article I wrote in 1993 for Irving Kristol's Public Interest , in which I identified four types of political parties. Two were based on European conflicts over religion: Religious parties favored established churches, and liberal parties favored the separation of church and state. Two others, socialist and nationalist, had their beginnings in attempts to rally the masses in the failed European revolutions of 1848, appealing to their working-class interests or their folk national yearnings. Structural features -- the Electoral College, the single-member House and Senate seats -- push American politics into a two-party system in which both are incentivized to amass 50% majorities in what has always been a culturally and economically diverse nation. So, America's political parties, operating in a unique republican framework and under democratic rules that predated Europe's, have partaken of each of these four impulses in varying degrees. In my Public Interest article, I argued that religious parties tend to fade out in nations with no majority faith, liberal parties tend to collapse as their characteristic skepticism leaves them yielding to violent opposition parties, and socialist parties tend to peter out because, at some point, socialism fails to work. Parties that endure, I argued, were, in some major respect, nationalist. American politics over the past 30 years provides some confirmation. The market-respecting liberalism of former President Bill Clinton's Democratic Party yielded to the woke socialism of former Presidents Barack Obama's and Joe Biden's. The religious emphasis and market economics of the Reagan-Bush Republican Party yielded to the demotic nationalism of President Donald Trump's. And Trump won, despite lawfare persecution, a significant and possibly enduring victory over the Democrats' woke socialism last November. My conclusion in 1993 and, tentatively, now is that nationalism is the glue that holds parties and nations together. The republican nationalism of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, the democratic nationalism of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and the nationalism of the two Roosevelt presidents, who remain vivid figures 116 and 80 years after leaving office. The problem we have encountered over the last 30 years is that other countries' nationalisms are not like America's. It turns out that neither the leaders nor the masses in Muslim nations have much interest in electoral democracy, market capitalism, or the rule of law. It turns out that the leaders of Western Europe, traumatized by the horrifying wars of the first half of the 20th century, seek a transnational harmony that overrules nations' democratic electorates and smothers market capitalism with regulations. In reaction, Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, as the formerly (under Tony Blair) liberal Labour Party split into socialist and Scottish National parties and the long-dominant Conservatives into high-education Conservatives and the Trumpish Reform UK party. In the 1990s, there was reason to hope that Russia was moving toward democracy and that China, despite the Tiananmen Square massacre, would move away from repression and toward convergence with rules-based market economies. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed power from the flailing Boris Yeltsin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping jailed one rival and abolished his predecessors' term limits. Putin has been in power for 25 years, almost as long as Joseph Stalin's 29, while Xi has been in power for 13 years, about half as long as Mao Zedong's 27. Putin has been following a nationalist policy that dates back not only to Stalin but also to the czars, expanding Russia's power outward from Muscovy in every direction -- though not as far in Ukraine as he hoped and expected. Xi evidently sees China as its emperors did for 2,000 years, as the greatest nation in the world, unfortunately recovering from a hundred years of humiliation by Western powers and Japan. Something similar has been happening in Mexico. Economic integration with Mexico and replacement of its one-party authoritarian rule by democratic rotation in office and the rule of law was the goal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, pushed in the 1990s by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who grew up on a ranch facing the Lower Rio Grande. NAFTA was ratified, the economies converged, and, as I witnessed, the opposition party ended 71 years of PRI party rule in July 2000. But former Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected in 2018, reinstalled one-party rule and government control of the economy, and his handpicked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected with 61% of the vote. AMLO, as Obrador is universally known, managed to reach accommodations with Trump, and Sheinbaum has as well. But Mexico remains culturally distant, with uncertain property rights and opaque governance despite its geographic proximity. One lesson seems to be that national character matters and that it is more a product of deep-seated history than of recent American policy initiatives. It pops up even when you don't expect it and can't be transformed by paper guarantees. Another lesson is that America, with its unique Constitution, fashioned in 1787 and revised in 1865-70 and, arguably, again in 1937-41, is indeed exceptional -- and that American exceptionalism is a wine that does not travel. A third lesson is that the hopes of the 1990s were not totally dashed. Eighty-five years ago, in 1940, a time when some current leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), were living, Adolf Hitler and Stalin were allies in command of or with their allies holding most of the landmass of Eurasia, opposed actively only by Great Britain, whose air force and navy were stretched to the limit. Representative government, guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections are much better off today than they were then, thanks in large part to the leadership at the time of the British nationalist Winston Churchill, the American nationalist Franklin Roosevelt, and the French nationalist Charles de Gaulle -- something to keep in mind as we bewail our current discontents.</td>\n",

       "      <td>International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to \"Syrian authorities\" for \"open &amp; constructive discussions\" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The UK's Stop Trump Coalition has released a statement on the day of Donald Trump's second inauguration - 20 January - pledging to \"mobilise in our thousands and our millions\". It has been signed by more than a thousand grassroots campaigners, trade unionists, climate activists and others. Unfortunately, the original Trump baby blimp - whose images were shared around the world - may not feature. It currently resides in the Museum of London The Coalition organised some of the biggest protests in British history in response to the president's state visits in 2017 and 2018. Back in July 2018, more than 250,000 people turned out in London for a Stop Trump protest: As BBC News reported at the time: Rather than a red carpet, there was a sea of people, as two large marches took place - one led by Women's March London and another by the Stop Trump Coalition. The crowds had strong messages for the president - from their problems with his policies to hair styling tips. They were determined to make their voices heard, or at least create a lot of noise to make their point - that they did not want President Trump in the country. Now, the Stop Trump coalition is re-grouping - and protests are expected in London and across the world today as Trump is sworn in. Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: In the coming weeks, we are likely to witness appalling attacks on migrants and minorities in America - just as we saw with the racist 'Muslim ban' in the opening days of the first Trump administration in 2017. It is essential that there is a broad, democratic coalition which can bring together the opposition to Trumpism - and to the new far right here in the UK. That means mobilising in big numbers, but it also means working to network and strengthen movements on climate, anti-racism, migrants' rights, feminism, LGBT rights and other touchstone issues, alongside the trade union movement and the left. We will look to respond to the Trump administration's first policies and to bring together the resistance to the politics of bigotry and division in the US and around the world. The statement, which has been signed by more than a thousand people, reads: \"The second inauguration is a dark moment. The far right is on the march, with a common agenda of right-wing nationalism, racism, sexism, LGBT-phobia, climate denialism, union-busting, authoritarianism, and elite impunity. They represent the interests of a wealthy elite who use bigotry and dishonesty to divide us against each other. No matter Trump's claims, illegal occupations and crimes against humanity continue - whether perpetrated by Israel in Palestine or by Russia in Ukraine. \"We are not shocked by this situation. Trump and Musk - and Farage and Badenoch - are symptoms of the failure of our political and economic system. Free market economics and austerity laid the ground. By failing to challenge the far right on immigration and other key issues, and instead mirroring their rhetoric and narratives, Starmer - like Macron, Harris and Scholz - is handing victory to the far right. \"During Trump's first presidency, the Stop Trump Coalition helped organise some of the biggest demonstrations in British history against his state visits. There are millions of people in the UK who want to fight back against the far right, stop runaway climate change, and stand for just peace across the world. There will be mass opposition to political cooperation with the Trump administration, and to any trade deal that threatens our NHS or food standards. \"Fighting back means mobilising in our thousands and in our millions - but it must also mean a more fundamental effort to unite and strengthen movements dedicated to social and environmental justice, working class organisation, and universal human and civil rights. We pledge ourselves to that work, and to building a resistance to Trump and the politics he represents.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nearly 60% of Nebraskavotedfor Donald Trump last November. There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. \"Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,\" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. \"For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling \"wearily\" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. \"There's no way it can,\" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. \"I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,\" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. \"The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens.\" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: \"I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska.\" That parishioner says people in the state \"understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid.\" However, given Nebraska's overwhelming vote for Trump, that assertion seems debatable.</td>\n",

       "      <td>IN AN extraordinary address at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President JD Vance warned that the greatest threat to Western democracies was not external aggression but the erosion of free speech within their own societies. Britain, he argued, was leading the charge in policing thought, with European nations following close behind. Vance'sspeech, widely expected to focus on geopolitics and the war in Ukraine, instead delivered a devastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its European allies. Invoking the Cold War, he argued that the West once defined itself in opposition to regimes that criminalised dissent and censored opposing views. Yet now, he said, it was Western governments adopting such tactics themselves. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'when I look at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners.' He went on to suggest that European elites, rather than upholding the democratic principles they claim to champion, had become fixated on controlling speech and political outcomes. 'Now, to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic,' he said, 'it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don't like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election.' Vance argued that curbing free expression in the name of political stability was a self-defeating strategy. 'I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy,' he said. In a speech liberally sprinkled with examples of free speech suppression, Vance reserved his sharpest criticism for the UK, as a society in which the government was increasingly encroaching on matters of individual conscience, treating religious expression as a form of subversion. He referencedAdam Smith-Connor, a British Army veteran who was found guilty of breaking the Government's new Buffer Zones Law (the catchily titledPublic Order Act 1986 (Amendment) (Abortion Clinics) Regulations 2023) which criminalises silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person's decision within 200 metres of an abortion facility. Successive UK governments have argued that such zones are necessary to prevent harassment outside clinics, though critics contend that the measures criminalise peaceful expression. Smith-Connor was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution. In Scotland, too, he noted, new legislation has led to concerns over the policing of private prayer. 'This last October [...] the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called \"safe access zones\", warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law. Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe,' he said. The letter, referenced by Vance, was sent following the passage of theAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Actin June 2024, which makes it an offence to attempt to influence someone's decision to access, provide, or facilitate abortion within 200 metres of an abortion clinic. Is his claim accurate? Technically, yes. While the law does not explicitly criminalise private prayer inside homes,the letter warnedthat activities in private residences could be unlawful if they were 'intentionally' or 'recklessly' visible or audible within the buffer zone. Official notes to the legislation cite the example of a resident inside the safe access zone displaying anti-abortion signs with the intent of deterring access to abortion services. In theory, a resident who prayed loudly enough to be heard outside, perhaps leaving windows and doors open, and especially with the aid of amplification, could also be in violation. Vance did not spare the rest of Europe. He criticised EU officials - or 'EU Commission commissars' as he termed them - for their threats to shut down social media platforms during periods of civil unrest. Such measures, he argued, were little more than an attack on public debate. '[T]he moment they spot what they've judged to be \"hateful content\", or to this very country where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of \"combating misogyny\" on the internet.' He also lambasted Romania forannulling the resultof the first round of its presidential election when a hard-right candidate came first, and condemned Sweden forimprisoning a far-right activistinvolved in Quran burnings. These actions, he suggested, demonstrated how European governments were increasingly willing to restrict speech to avoid controversy or discomfort. 'We must do more than talk about democratic values. We must live them,' he said, urging European leaders to uphold free speech rather than curtail it in the name of public order or social cohesion. Vance was not blind to the issue in his own country, however, acknowledging that the US had also struggled with free speech in recent years. 'I will admit that sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation [...] Our own governmentencouraged private companies to silence peoplewho dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth.' Whilst Vance's critique was directed at the Biden administration's approach to online discourse, he insisted that the Trump administration would take a sharply different stance, making opposition to censorship a pillar of its foreign policy. 'There is a new sheriff in town,' he declared. 'And under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer them in the public square.' Perhaps predictably, his address ruffled feathers in a room filled with priggish European technocrats, many of whom have championed expanding 'hate speech' laws and increasingly restrictive digital regulation in recent years. Carl Bildt, the co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and former Prime Minister of Sweden, condemned Vance's remarks, dismissing them as politically motivated. 'At best it was totally irrelevant to European or global security concerns. At worst it was blatant interference in the [German] election campaign in favour of far-right AfD,' he wrote on X. Mr Bildt added that the speech had been 'significantly worse than expected'. In the UK, the Liberal Democrats were also quick to push back, with foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller criticising Vance's remarks. 'Britain will not take lectures about political freedoms from the acolyte of a president who tried to undermine American democracy and now praises Putin. The British people will see straight through this hypocrisy,' he claimed. Not all responses were negative, however. Reform UK's Rupert Lowe welcomed Vance's intervention, posting on social media: 'The Americans have got a real hero in JD Vance.' With the UK and EU continuing to expand their respective legal frameworks around speech regulation, and the Trump administration now positioning itself as a staunch defender of free expression, the transatlantic divide on free speech looks set to widen further.</td>\n",

They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this.\" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims. That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included: \"Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?\" \"Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good.\" \"Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?\" \"What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?\" \"Is that big rock going to smoosh him?\" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. \"What we need is better education,\" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. \"Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying.\" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. \"I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,\" Steve said. \"Things are going great.\" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing ofGilmore Girls.</td>\n",

The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. \"I'm missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTE,\" said one driver, unaware the car they've been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago.

Public consciousness of child sexual exploitation in the United Kingdom reached an inflection point this winter after victims shared account after gut-churning account of sexual savagery and careless murder being perpetrated against underage white girls by Pakistani-Muslim men up and down the country. These brave survivors recount how police and social workers were complicit in their abuse, losing evidence, asserting that children could consent , and failing to investigate rapes for fear of being called racist. In one instance, a girl had a morning-after pill forced into her mouth by a police officer . Significant constituencies of the public believe that attempts are being made to cover up the historic failures of both local and national authorities, including 65% of Labour voters. These accusations of corruption, galvanised by high-profile political figures like Elon Musk, have been branded ' far-right' by Keir Starmer, which has only caused the public's attention to shift toward the prime minister and his record as Director of Public Prosecutions . The prime minister fueled speculations of a cover-up when he issued a three-line party whip--the most stringent form of party discipline--against Labour MPs, forcing them to vote against the investigation or risk expulsion from the party. When the vote came, therefore, MPs from the top 50 towns known to be sheltering grooming gangs either abstained or voted against the investigation. Only 3 MPs living in these grooming gang hotspots favoured an investigation. In each instance, the member came from the Conservative Party. No Labour MP voted in favour of an investigation, with around one-fifth abstaining or absent. The result produced a seismic backlash, including from angry victims , in whose names Labour claimed a national investigation would be counterproductive to change. The party line is, \"The investigation has already been had\" and \"It is time to get to work.\" This has proven to be one of these sleight-of-hand truths intended to cover all manner of sins. As Reform MP Nigel Farage highlighted for the House, this preexisting inquiry--all 459 pages of it--fails to mention \"grooming gangs\" and of the over 50 towns in England known to be harbouring this scourge, only the infamous Rotherham is mentioned. It is thought that the number of girls who have been victims of child sexual exploitation, sexual assault, and rape by these gangs could be a quarter of a million--at the most conservative estimate. In twelve months alone, a Grooming Gangs Taskforce helped UK police identify and protect \"over 4,000 victims.\" The towering ambiguity of just how many girls have been affected should, alone, give cause for a comprehensive, rigorous, and far-reaching investigation. The need is unambiguous and the public mandate is indisputable. Some within the Labour Party are coming to this realisation. MPs have begun to break ranks to side with the opposition in calling for an investigation, including Dan Carden , Paul Waugh , and Sarah Champion --MPs for the infamous Rochdale and Rotherham. But the cynic in me believes this limp 'I am Spartacus'-moment struggles to amount to more than career protection. I do not believe there is the desire or the passion to put an end to the ritual rape of these girls by gangs of foreign men. For decades, MPs have had their eyes wide shut to this scourge. The cold, unfeeling truth is that these girls have been dismissed because their abuse is a political inconvenience. The facts of this atrocity contradict the tenets of 'inclusivity' and 'tolerance' that characterise our modern age. From infancy until death, the public is schooled that diversity is--and can only ever be--a strength. If an immigrant living in a Western nation engages in criminal or grotesque behaviour, he does not reflect the customs and attitudes of his home nation. Nor is he to be included in the ranks of the 'DiverseTM'. He is to be viewed as an innocent--a child--lashing out at a cruel and misunderstanding people. Whether he emerges from a war zone or a paradise, he is to be understood as suffering an impenetrable trauma that gifts rationality to his barbarity. All of which is to say, it is impossible for one to identify a pattern of perversity in any one community, religion, country, or culture. It is in this vein that the British public is charged to ignore the demographic shift in their constituencies--ignore how this might influence a politician's vote. They are forbidden from noticing that the fast-food economy which sustains the middle-class lifestyle also sustains the perpetrators in these rape gangs. They must blind themselves to the incontrovertible. Labour is no longer the party of the white working class because the white, working-class vote is no longer useful to them.It is not the rape of the nation's children the UK Government is trying to cover up, nor is it the endemic failures in local councils and child protection services. What they wish to deny is an attitude: that the life of a white, working-class girl--much like her consent--is surplus to requirements.   \n",

The first is that people will die as a result. There will be less money to respond to humanitarian crises and less money for vaccination programmes and hospitals. Realpolitik is being blamed for the decision, but realpolitik doesn't make it right. But there are also economic arguments for rich countries providing financial support to less well-off nations, which were summed up succinctly in last year's Labour party manifesto . This document could not have been clearer. International assistance, it said, helps make \"the world a safer, more prosperous place\". That remains as true as it was when Labour came to power last summer, and indeed it was still the party's stated belief a month ago. When, as one of his first decisions, Donald Trump gutted the US aid budget, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it could be a \" big strategic mistake \". Now that the UK has followed suit and reduced aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national output, Lammy says it was a difficult but pragmatic decision. He was right before and is wrong now. At its crudest, the economic case for overseas aid is that it is good for business. As countries become richer, they provide export opportunities for donor countries. The US has always understood this, with postwar Marshall aid for European reconstruction in part driven by fear of the spread of communism and in part as a means to provide markets for US goods. Under previous administrations, US humanitarian aid programmes have channelled agricultural surpluses into overseas food programmes. In today's world, it is no longer possible to think of aid spending and defence spending as discrete pots of money. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in those parts of the world most seriously damaged by wars and the climate crisis. Five years ago, the global economy was about to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a shock from which the UK has yet to recover. Ministers need to ask themselves a simple question: does cutting the aid budget make another worldwide health emergency more or less likely? Poor countries need help to boost economic development more than ever. They havebeen hard hit by the double whammy of Covid and the higher food prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. A new debt crisis is looming, and both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been warning that money that could and should be spent on schools, hospitals and building protection against the effects of the climate emergency is instead being spent paying back creditors. The Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown spearheaded previous debt relief efforts and were able to do so because Britain showed a strong commitment to overseas assistance. A new Department for International Development was set up, a goal was set of meeting the UN aid target of 0.7% of national income, and there was a clear gameplan. Spending more on aid was good for poor countries, but it was also good for rich countries such as Britain. It was a classic example of the exercise of soft power. Britain punched well above its weight when development issues were discussed at the IMF and World Bank. The world is a lot more fragile and divided than it was in the early years of this century, when growth was strong and the era of financial crises and global pandemics was still in the future. With the US and China locked in a battle for economic supremacy, the battle is on to capture hearts and minds. Seen in this context, the UK's decision to follow the US lead on aid spending is shortsighted. It will merely make poor countries more susceptible to offers of assistance from Beijing. None of which is to say that every penny of aid is well spent. Yes, there is waste, as there is with defence spending. But in making the choice it has, the government has effectively bought into the rightwing argument that aid does more harm than good and traps poor people into a dependency culture. Labour needs to be careful. The right says the same about the welfare state, which will be next on its list of targets. There is a case for higher defence spending. It is a more dangerous world and Britain can no longer rely on the US to provide guaranteed military support. But let's be clear. The reason the aid budget is being cut to pay for the armed forces is not because it is the best way to raise money but because it is the easiest. The government is calculating that it will get far less grief from voters - especially Labour voters flirting with Reform UK - this way. There are alternatives. Rachel Reeves could increase taxes on the wealthy. If the need is really as urgent as the government says, then the chancellor could justify borrowing more. A truly progressive government would be reviving the idea of a Robin Hood tax on speculative financial transactions to meet its manifesto pledge of raising aid spending back to 0.7% of national income. Instead, Starmer has done the reverse of a Robin Hood tax. Shamefully, he is balancing the books courtesy of the poorest people in the world. This will not make the world a safer and more prosperous place. The exact opposite, in fact.   \n",

Forty thousand acres of natural and urban land have been scorched, more than 12,300 structures decimated, and tens of thousands of families lost their homes, pets, baby books, and most cherished possessions. The displaced are now fanning out, seeking temporary shelter with friends and family, in hotels, or in rental units. Many will have trouble finding a place to stay in a city that was already as many as 450,000 affordable units short before the fires. When there are more heads than beds, it's a seller's market. When there are more heads than beds in a crisis, it's a gouger's market. Cue the greedy landlords. In the past week, the price of rental units has skyrocketed. Tenants are inundating government and non-government agencies with complaints of price gouging, according to the Housing Rights Center . A review of Zillow listings by The New York Times found that rent prices in West Los Angeles have spiked from 15 percent to an \"eye-popping 64 percent.\" And residents have begun cataloging an ever-growing list of inexplicably large price spikes in a jaw-dropping Google Sheet , a veritable rogue's gallery of tenant exploitation, broken down by street address. According to the list, a one bedroom townhome outside Jefferson Park jumped from $900 to $2,300 . Another in downtown Los Angeles (one of the few listings that does allow pets) spiked from $1,095 to $3,200 . A five-bed, five-bath near Brentwood Heights went from $12,000 to $15,000. When asked about the shocking rent hikes, an L.A.-area listing agent offered the most-commonly invoked defense of price gouging: it was just \" supply and demand \" at work. Unfortunately, this type of price gouging after natural disasters is all too common. Early in the pandemic, price gouging on masks, hand sanitizer, respirators, and clorox wipes was rampant. After Hurricane Harvey, the Texas attorney general reported an instance of gougers charging a whopping $99 for a case of water . This is why the majority of states -- including California -- have price gouging laws on the books. These laws are designed to protect consumers when the markets may be impacted by natural disasters, pandemics, or other disruptions, like supply chain shocks -- but they are only as good as their enforcers. Area residents are reporting price hikes that far exceed California's 10-percent threshold for price gouging. Lawmakers must work quickly to crack down on these predators, and make an example of some of the worst offenders. It is good to see that California Governor Gavin Newsom has extended price - gouging protections for rental housing through March, and that California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced his office will be ramping up resources to investigate and prosecute offenders. Even if they act fast, it won't be enough. Because the problem is bigger than the greedy landlords. The private equity vultures have also descended on the Hollywood Hills, and begun sifting through the rubble, looking to see what they might be able to acquire in a fire sale. Real estate agents are calling for the city to suspend its new \" mansion tax ,\" which applies to deals over $5 million, and last year raised $375 million for affordable housing -- a duck call for investors and corporate landlords looking to expand their footprint in the rental market. In a letter , realtors argued, \"Exempting developers from the transfer tax for five years will encourage them to purchase land from homeowners at reasonable prices and quickly rebuild these devastated communities.\" Suspending the mansion tax will starve the city of the resources it needs to rebuild the affordable housing units displaced families require. It is the opposite of what policymakers should do to meet this moment. Now is the perfect time to show Angelenos why they passed this legislation in the first place, using the proceeds to deliver affordable housing on an expedited timeline that matches the urgency of this crisis. Lawmakers can look to the recent successes of Executive Directive 1, which streamlined some permitting for affordable units, as a roadmap. And while residents wait for additional housing to come online, policymakers should extend price gouging protections to renters through at least the end of 2025, and prohibit application fees, credit check fees, and other junk fees that drive up the total cost of rent during this period as well. Crises like natural disasters expose and widen the existing fault lines in our economy and our public policy. Rent gouging after a wildfire is galling, but the hard truth is that every day, across this country, tenants are exploited by a housing system that is failing them. Even before the wildfires, our country was facing a severe housing affordability crisis, driven in part by corporate landlords working to extract as much as they can from us and our neighbors. The lack of affordable housing across the country, and in major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles in particular, leaves us vulnerable to the whims of landlords. Private equity's deepening penetration into the residential real estate market only exacerbates this power imbalance. This dynamic shows no sign of abating as President Trump's new nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development extolled the virtues of private equity at his confirmation hearing this week. If we want to stop the vultures from circling, we must build a housing system that can not only withstand dangerous weather, but also the dangers of an economy that makes a fair price for rent increasingly elusive.

High concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are warming the planet. International law is also clear: under the legally binding Paris climate agreement, nations pledged to keep average temperatures within 1.5 degC of pre-industrial levels. And yet, as emissions continue to increase, global temperature rises will almost certainly exceed this limit . The research community is frustrated that its warnings are not being heeded. What is the point of a legally binding agreement if countries can effectively ignore it? Some scientists are arguing that climate researchers need to become climate activists, too 1 , 2 . But others, and more than a few governments, are not giving up on the legal route. Because the Paris agreement lacks an enforcement mechanism, they want courts to ensure that all those with climate responsibility -- nationally and internationally -- can be held to their promises. And they have been busy going to court. By the end of last year, 2,666 climate-litigation cases had been filed worldwide, according to a report 3 by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, published in June (see 'Climate in court'). Most claimants are individuals , young and old, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). All are looking to hold governments and companies accountable for their climate pledges. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4 acknowledged that , if successful, climate litigation \"can lead to an increase in a country's overall ambition to tackle climate change\". Note the phrase, \"if successful\". There have been a handful of landmark judgments. For example, in May, courts in Germany and the United Kingdom separately found that their government's policies would fail to meet emissions-reduction targets that are set out in law. But most claimants struggle to get a positive result, as Joana Setzer and Catherine Higham, researchers at the Grantham Institute in London, show in their report 3 . Much climate litigation is mired in a maze of process and procedure. In some instances, respondents -- mostly corporations -- are embarking on counter-litigation, essentially challenging climate laws that they do not like. This is where the entry of the world's highest court could be a game changer. In the next few months, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations' principal judicial organ in The Hague, the Netherlands, will begin hearing evidence on two broad questions: first, what are countries' obligations in international law to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, and second, what should the legal consequences be for states when their actions -- or failure to act -- cause harm? The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature This could be one of the most consequential developments in climate policy since the Paris agreement itself. Adil Najam, president of the global conservation NGO WWF, writes in a World View that the ICJ's opinion \"will amplify the voices of millions of scientists and citizens who are demanding strong ambition and action on climate and nature protection\". These voices include people arguing against greenwashing, or for the protection from climate change as a human right , as well as public authorities seeking compensation from corporations for climate-related harms, under the 'polluter pays' principle. Last September, California launched legal action against five of the world's largest oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell -- and their subsidiaries, demanding that they pay \"for the costs of their impacts to the environment, human health and Californians' livelihoods, and to help protect the state against the harms that climate change will cause in years to come\". Brazil's public prosecutor's office and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources are seeking compensation for harms specifically from greenhouse-gas emissions caused by illegal deforestation 5 . The ICJ's opinion, although non-binding, will be especially important for low- and middle-income countries, which have comparatively less access to expertise in climate science, policy and law than do high-income countries. One criticism of climate litigation states that courts should not be getting involved in what are essentially political processes. The argument is that, if climate laws lack an enforcement mechanism, then governments need to legislate for one. According to this idea, it shouldn't be up to the courts to do something that is the job of governments; that would be judicial overreach. Courts are well aware of these concerns, and the ICJ will be, too. Legal redress is but one tool in a larger toolbox of actions. Ultimately, climate action at scale and pace will happen only when the international community is persuaded that humanity has no alternative but to decarbonize in a just way; not because of the threat of prosecutions, but because our collective survival depends on it. But the law has a key role. And the ICJ's opinion, backed by the highest standards of evidence, will be necessary in clarifying states' responsibility for climate harms and their obligation to protect the environment from emissions.   \n",
       "300                                                                                                                                  As one who shared the hope, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, that representative government , guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections would spread across the globe, I naturally look back over the intervening long generation and ask what went wrong. In the 1990s, it seemed to many that the vision of Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man would prevail. Not that bad things would never happen again. Fukuyama's more subtle thesis was that after the debacle of communism, there was no intellectually viable alternative to some combination of political democracy and market capitalism as the means to a decent society. But the past three decades have seen the vitality of politically viable alternatives -- China's dictatorial and Russia's authoritarian state-directed capitalism, the oppressive clerical regimes of Shiite Iran, and various Sunni Muslim states. By Freedom House's sophisticated measures , 2004 saw a high point in global freedom, which has been in decline ever since. How to explain this trend, the opposite of what I hoped for and predicted? As I have reflected on this question, I've fallen back on an article I wrote in 1993 for Irving Kristol's Public Interest , in which I identified four types of political parties. Two were based on European conflicts over religion: Religious parties favored established churches, and liberal parties favored the separation of church and state. Two others, socialist and nationalist, had their beginnings in attempts to rally the masses in the failed European revolutions of 1848, appealing to their working-class interests or their folk national yearnings. Structural features -- the Electoral College, the single-member House and Senate seats -- push American politics into a two-party system in which both are incentivized to amass 50% majorities in what has always been a culturally and economically diverse nation. So, America's political parties, operating in a unique republican framework and under democratic rules that predated Europe's, have partaken of each of these four impulses in varying degrees. In my Public Interest article, I argued that religious parties tend to fade out in nations with no majority faith, liberal parties tend to collapse as their characteristic skepticism leaves them yielding to violent opposition parties, and socialist parties tend to peter out because, at some point, socialism fails to work. Parties that endure, I argued, were, in some major respect, nationalist. American politics over the past 30 years provides some confirmation. The market-respecting liberalism of former President Bill Clinton's Democratic Party yielded to the woke socialism of former Presidents Barack Obama's and Joe Biden's. The religious emphasis and market economics of the Reagan-Bush Republican Party yielded to the demotic nationalism of President Donald Trump's. And Trump won, despite lawfare persecution, a significant and possibly enduring victory over the Democrats' woke socialism last November. My conclusion in 1993 and, tentatively, now is that nationalism is the glue that holds parties and nations together. The republican nationalism of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, the democratic nationalism of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and the nationalism of the two Roosevelt presidents, who remain vivid figures 116 and 80 years after leaving office. The problem we have encountered over the last 30 years is that other countries' nationalisms are not like America's. It turns out that neither the leaders nor the masses in Muslim nations have much interest in electoral democracy, market capitalism, or the rule of law. It turns out that the leaders of Western Europe, traumatized by the horrifying wars of the first half of the 20th century, seek a transnational harmony that overrules nations' democratic electorates and smothers market capitalism with regulations. In reaction, Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, as the formerly (under Tony Blair) liberal Labour Party split into socialist and Scottish National parties and the long-dominant Conservatives into high-education Conservatives and the Trumpish Reform UK party. In the 1990s, there was reason to hope that Russia was moving toward democracy and that China, despite the Tiananmen Square massacre, would move away from repression and toward convergence with rules-based market economies. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed power from the flailing Boris Yeltsin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping jailed one rival and abolished his predecessors' term limits. Putin has been in power for 25 years, almost as long as Joseph Stalin's 29, while Xi has been in power for 13 years, about half as long as Mao Zedong's 27. Putin has been following a nationalist policy that dates back not only to Stalin but also to the czars, expanding Russia's power outward from Muscovy in every direction -- though not as far in Ukraine as he hoped and expected. Xi evidently sees China as its emperors did for 2,000 years, as the greatest nation in the world, unfortunately recovering from a hundred years of humiliation by Western powers and Japan. Something similar has been happening in Mexico. Economic integration with Mexico and replacement of its one-party authoritarian rule by democratic rotation in office and the rule of law was the goal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, pushed in the 1990s by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who grew up on a ranch facing the Lower Rio Grande. NAFTA was ratified, the economies converged, and, as I witnessed, the opposition party ended 71 years of PRI party rule in July 2000. But former Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected in 2018, reinstalled one-party rule and government control of the economy, and his handpicked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected with 61% of the vote. AMLO, as Obrador is universally known, managed to reach accommodations with Trump, and Sheinbaum has as well. But Mexico remains culturally distant, with uncertain property rights and opaque governance despite its geographic proximity. One lesson seems to be that national character matters and that it is more a product of deep-seated history than of recent American policy initiatives. It pops up even when you don't expect it and can't be transformed by paper guarantees. Another lesson is that America, with its unique Constitution, fashioned in 1787 and revised in 1865-70 and, arguably, again in 1937-41, is indeed exceptional -- and that American exceptionalism is a wine that does not travel. A third lesson is that the hopes of the 1990s were not totally dashed. Eighty-five years ago, in 1940, a time when some current leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), were living, Adolf Hitler and Stalin were allies in command of or with their allies holding most of the landmass of Eurasia, opposed actively only by Great Britain, whose air force and navy were stretched to the limit. Representative government, guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections are much better off today than they were then, thanks in large part to the leadership at the time of the British nationalist Winston Churchill, the American nationalist Franklin Roosevelt, and the French nationalist Charles de Gaulle -- something to keep in mind as we bewail our current discontents.   \n",

                      In a stunning revelation that has rocked the global political landscape, insiders have claimed that a secretive group known as the Shadow Council has been orchestrating international policy decisions behind the scenes for over two decades. According to anonymous sources within high-ranking government agencies, this clandestine network meets in undisclosed locations to determine the fate of nations—manipulating economic strategies, military deployments, and diplomatic relations with ruthless precision. One whistleblower, insisting on anonymity, described the council’s gatherings as “a blend of high-level intrigue and covert power plays,” where a handful of elite figures shape world events. Despite a complete lack of verifiable evidence and rebuttals from reputable fact-checkers, rumors persist, stirring suspicion among citizens and igniting fierce debates over the true nature of global governance. Critics demand full transparency, while supporters dismiss the claims as a political witch hunt.   \n",

Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.   \n",

It has been signed by more than a thousand grassroots campaigners, trade unionists, climate activists and others. Unfortunately, the original Trump baby blimp - whose images were shared around the world - may not feature. It currently resides in the Museum of London The Coalition organised some of the biggest protests in British history in response to the president's state visits in 2017 and 2018. Back in July 2018, more than 250,000 people turned out in London for a Stop Trump protest: As BBC News reported at the time: Rather than a red carpet, there was a sea of people, as two large marches took place - one led by Women's March London and another by the Stop Trump Coalition. The crowds had strong messages for the president - from their problems with his policies to hair styling tips. They were determined to make their voices heard, or at least create a lot of noise to make their point - that they did not want President Trump in the country. Now, the Stop Trump coalition is re-grouping - and protests are expected in London and across the world today as Trump is sworn in. Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: In the coming weeks, we are likely to witness appalling attacks on migrants and minorities in America - just as we saw with the racist 'Muslim ban' in the opening days of the first Trump administration in 2017. It is essential that there is a broad, democratic coalition which can bring together the opposition to Trumpism - and to the new far right here in the UK. That means mobilising in big numbers, but it also means working to network and strengthen movements on climate, anti-racism, migrants' rights, feminism, LGBT rights and other touchstone issues, alongside the trade union movement and the left. We will look to respond to the Trump administration's first policies and to bring together the resistance to the politics of bigotry and division in the US and around the world. The statement, which has been signed by more than a thousand people, reads: \"The second inauguration is a dark moment. The far right is on the march, with a common agenda of right-wing nationalism, racism, sexism, LGBT-phobia, climate denialism, union-busting, authoritarianism, and elite impunity. They represent the interests of a wealthy elite who use bigotry and dishonesty to divide us against each other. No matter Trump's claims, illegal occupations and crimes against humanity continue - whether perpetrated by Israel in Palestine or by Russia in Ukraine. \"We are not shocked by this situation. Trump and Musk - and Farage and Badenoch - are symptoms of the failure of our political and economic system. Free market economics and austerity laid the ground. By failing to challenge the far right on immigration and other key issues, and instead mirroring their rhetoric and narratives, Starmer - like Macron, Harris and Scholz - is handing victory to the far right. \"During Trump's first presidency, the Stop Trump Coalition helped organise some of the biggest demonstrations in British history against his state visits. There are millions of people in the UK who want to fight back against the far right, stop runaway climate change, and stand for just peace across the world. There will be mass opposition to political cooperation with the Trump administration, and to any trade deal that threatens our NHS or food standards. \"Fighting back means mobilising in our thousands and in our millions - but it must also mean a more fundamental effort to unite and strengthen movements dedicated to social and environmental justice, working class organisation, and universal human and civil rights. We pledge ourselves to that work, and to building a resistance to Trump and the politics he represents.\"   \n",

   Nearly 60% of Nebraskavotedfor Donald Trump last November. There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. \"Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,\" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. \"For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling \"wearily\" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. \"There's no way it can,\" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. \"I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,\" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. \"The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens.\" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: \"I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska.\" That parishioner says people in the state \"understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid.\" However, given Nebraska's overwhelming vote for Trump, that assertion seems debatable.   \n",
       "1100  IN AN extraordinary address at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President JD Vance warned that the greatest threat to Western democracies was not external aggression but the erosion of free speech within their own societies. Britain, he argued, was leading the charge in policing thought, with European nations following close behind. Vance'sspeech, widely expected to focus on geopolitics and the war in Ukraine, instead delivered a devastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its European allies. Invoking the Cold War, he argued that the West once defined itself in opposition to regimes that criminalised dissent and censored opposing views. Yet now, he said, it was Western governments adopting such tactics themselves. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'when I look at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners.' He went on to suggest that European elites, rather than upholding the democratic principles they claim to champion, had become fixated on controlling speech and political outcomes. 'Now, to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic,' he said, 'it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don't like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election.' Vance argued that curbing free expression in the name of political stability was a self-defeating strategy. 'I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy,' he said. In a speech liberally sprinkled with examples of free speech suppression, Vance reserved his sharpest criticism for the UK, as a society in which the government was increasingly encroaching on matters of individual conscience, treating religious expression as a form of subversion. He referencedAdam Smith-Connor, a British Army veteran who was found guilty of breaking the Government's new Buffer Zones Law (the catchily titledPublic Order Act 1986 (Amendment) (Abortion Clinics) Regulations 2023) which criminalises silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person's decision within 200 metres of an abortion facility. Successive UK governments have argued that such zones are necessary to prevent harassment outside clinics, though critics contend that the measures criminalise peaceful expression. Smith-Connor was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution. In Scotland, too, he noted, new legislation has led to concerns over the policing of private prayer. 'This last October [...] the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called \"safe access zones\", warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law. Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe,' he said. The letter, referenced by Vance, was sent following the passage of theAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Actin June 2024, which makes it an offence to attempt to influence someone's decision to access, provide, or facilitate abortion within 200 metres of an abortion clinic. Is his claim accurate? Technically, yes. While the law does not explicitly criminalise private prayer inside homes,the letter warnedthat activities in private residences could be unlawful if they were 'intentionally' or 'recklessly' visible or audible within the buffer zone. Official notes to the legislation cite the example of a resident inside the safe access zone displaying anti-abortion signs with the intent of deterring access to abortion services. In theory, a resident who prayed loudly enough to be heard outside, perhaps leaving windows and doors open, and especially with the aid of amplification, could also be in violation. Vance did not spare the rest of Europe. He criticised EU officials - or 'EU Commission commissars' as he termed them - for their threats to shut down social media platforms during periods of civil unrest. Such measures, he argued, were little more than an attack on public debate. '[T]he moment they spot what they've judged to be \"hateful content\", or to this very country where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of \"combating misogyny\" on the internet.' He also lambasted Romania forannulling the resultof the first round of its presidential election when a hard-right candidate came first, and condemned Sweden forimprisoning a far-right activistinvolved in Quran burnings. These actions, he suggested, demonstrated how European governments were increasingly willing to restrict speech to avoid controversy or discomfort. 'We must do more than talk about democratic values. We must live them,' he said, urging European leaders to uphold free speech rather than curtail it in the name of public order or social cohesion. Vance was not blind to the issue in his own country, however, acknowledging that the US had also struggled with free speech in recent years. 'I will admit that sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation [...] Our own governmentencouraged private companies to silence peoplewho dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth.' Whilst Vance's critique was directed at the Biden administration's approach to online discourse, he insisted that the Trump administration would take a sharply different stance, making opposition to censorship a pillar of its foreign policy. 'There is a new sheriff in town,' he declared. 'And under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer them in the public square.' Perhaps predictably, his address ruffled feathers in a room filled with priggish European technocrats, many of whom have championed expanding 'hate speech' laws and increasingly restrictive digital regulation in recent years. Carl Bildt, the co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and former Prime Minister of Sweden, condemned Vance's remarks, dismissing them as politically motivated. 'At best it was totally irrelevant to European or global security concerns. At worst it was blatant interference in the [German] election campaign in favour of far-right AfD,' he wrote on X. Mr Bildt added that the speech had been 'significantly worse than expected'. In the UK, the Liberal Democrats were also quick to push back, with foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller criticising Vance's remarks. 'Britain will not take lectures about political freedoms from the acolyte of a president who tried to undermine American democracy and now praises Putin. The British people will see straight through this hypocrisy,' he claimed. Not all responses were negative, however. Reform UK's Rupert Lowe welcomed Vance's intervention, posting on social media: 'The Americans have got a real hero in JD Vance.' With the UK and EU continuing to expand their respective legal frameworks around speech regulation, and the Trump administration now positioning itself as a staunch defender of free expression, the transatlantic divide on free speech looks set to widen further.   \n",

diminished by Leslie's constant question-asking, reports Steve. \"I don't think she realizes that every question she asks is literally going to be answered by the movie if she just watches it,\" Steve recalled. \"Like, that's what stories do. They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this.\" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims. That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included: \"Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?\" \"Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good.\" \"Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?\" \"What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?\" \"Is that big rock going to smoosh him?\" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. \"What we need is better education,\" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. \"Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying.\" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. \"I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,\" Steve said. \"Things are going great.\" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing ofGilmore Girls.   \n",

Cub Carcass Dumpers endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president on Monday. \"The Federated Union of Bear Cub Carcass Dumpers stands 100% behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the only candidate in the 2024 to have earned an A grade on their bear-dumping scorecard,\" said FUBCCD president Walter Hudkins, who endorsed the independent candidate on behalf of the organization's 300,000 dues-paying members. \"Leaving the carcass of a young black bear in the middle of Central Park is exactly the kind of leadership quality this country sorely needs. In addition to this endorsement, we will be making a $50 million donation to the pro-Kennedy super PAC Bear Dump America. Remember, we dump bear carcasses, and we vote.\" At press time, Hudkins added that in contrast, former President Donald Trump had a measly C rating from the organization.   \n",

reported in some areas in Ireland today as people attempt to dispense with their post-Christmas cans of beer, in the first Christmas since the Re-turn recycling scheme was introduced. \"Authorities should have seen this coming, we should have quadrupled the number of machines,\" said one man from his car which he has been trapped in for 17 hours just outside the car park to his local Lidl such is the traffic. With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren't out of order, the country's main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey. \"I didn't think it through when I got in the eight slabs for the Christmas, I usually have a mental breakdown when I do the post-Christmas dump run but I guess I'll just have it now,\" added one individual towing a trailer full of his haul of Christmas cans which included some from the days they had the in-laws and neighbours over. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. \"I'm missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTE,\" said one driver, unaware the car they've been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago. UPDATE: Supermarkets with Re-turn machines are now providing hose down showers for drivers stuck in their cars for hours on end who now stink of stale alcohol emanating from their boots and back seats.   \n",

                             The Netflix producers and cameras were all in tow as Harry hugged another disabled Afghanistan veteran for the cameras. This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in 'real life' by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans. Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children's book The Stench. Disabled Veterans Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. \"It's a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually 'care' despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that's something for another day. You just can't fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved. Exploiting the disabled and old for your own monetary and press gain is truly despicable, but it's all part of the game, and these two money-grabbing tricksters play that game very well.\" Here's to the VVIP (Vile Vindictive Insolent Parasite) Sussexes...
