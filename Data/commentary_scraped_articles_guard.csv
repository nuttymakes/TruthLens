Labour’s aid cuts are morally wrong. Here’s why they make no economic sense either,"G et right down to it and there are two reasons for thinking that cuts to Britain's aid budget to pay for defence are a seriously bad idea. The first is that people will die as a result. There will be less money to respond to humanitarian crises and less money for vaccination programmes and hospitals. Realpolitik is being blamed for the decision, but realpolitik doesn't make it right. But there are also economic arguments for rich countries providing financial support to less well-off nations, which were summed up succinctly in last year's Labour party manifesto . This document could not have been clearer. International assistance, it said, helps make ""the world a safer, more prosperous place"". That remains as true as it was when Labour came to power last summer, and indeed it was still the party's stated belief a month ago. When, as one of his first decisions, Donald Trump gutted the US aid budget, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it could be a "" big strategic mistake "". Now that the UK has followed suit and reduced aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national output, Lammy says it was a difficult but pragmatic decision. He was right before and is wrong now. At its crudest, the economic case for overseas aid is that it is good for business. As countries become richer, they provide export opportunities for donor countries. The US has always understood this, with postwar Marshall aid for European reconstruction in part driven by fear of the spread of communism and in part as a means to provide markets for US goods. Under previous administrations, US humanitarian aid programmes have channelled agricultural surpluses into overseas food programmes. In today's world, it is no longer possible to think of aid spending and defence spending as discrete pots of money. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in those parts of the world most seriously damaged by wars and the climate crisis. Five years ago, the global economy was about to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a shock from which the UK has yet to recover. Ministers need to ask themselves a simple question: does cutting the aid budget make another worldwide health emergency more or less likely? Poor countries need help to boost economic development more than ever. They havebeen hard hit by the double whammy of Covid and the higher food prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. A new debt crisis is looming, and both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been warning that money that could and should be spent on schools, hospitals and building protection against the effects of the climate emergency is instead being spent paying back creditors. The Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown spearheaded previous debt relief efforts and were able to do so because Britain showed a strong commitment to overseas assistance. A new Department for International Development was set up, a goal was set of meeting the UN aid target of 0.7% of national income, and there was a clear gameplan. Spending more on aid was good for poor countries, but it was also good for rich countries such as Britain. It was a classic example of the exercise of soft power. Britain punched well above its weight when development issues were discussed at the IMF and World Bank. The world is a lot more fragile and divided than it was in the early years of this century, when growth was strong and the era of financial crises and global pandemics was still in the future. With the US and China locked in a battle for economic supremacy, the battle is on to capture hearts and minds. Seen in this context, the UK's decision to follow the US lead on aid spending is shortsighted. It will merely make poor countries more susceptible to offers of assistance from Beijing. None of which is to say that every penny of aid is well spent. Yes, there is waste, as there is with defence spending. But in making the choice it has, the government has effectively bought into the rightwing argument that aid does more harm than good and traps poor people into a dependency culture. Labour needs to be careful. The right says the same about the welfare state, which will be next on its list of targets. There is a case for higher defence spending. It is a more dangerous world and Britain can no longer rely on the US to provide guaranteed military support. But let's be clear. The reason the aid budget is being cut to pay for the armed forces is not because it is the best way to raise money but because it is the easiest. The government is calculating that it will get far less grief from voters - especially Labour voters flirting with Reform UK - this way. There are alternatives. Rachel Reeves could increase taxes on the wealthy. If the need is really as urgent as the government says, then the chancellor could justify borrowing more. A truly progressive government would be reviving the idea of a Robin Hood tax on speculative financial transactions to meet its manifesto pledge of raising aid spending back to 0.7% of national income. Instead, Starmer has done the reverse of a Robin Hood tax. Shamefully, he is balancing the books courtesy of the poorest people in the world. This will not make the world a safer and more prosperous place. The exact opposite, in fact.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T09:00:54.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/us-cut-aid-budget-labour-big-mistake
"With lists and notebooks, I find that I am worryingly on the same page as Elon Musk","W atching Keir Starmer with President Trump in Washington last week was a bit like watching an indulgent grandparent deal with a miscreant child. When the prime minister produced his invitation from King Charles - ""This is unprecedented!"" he said delightedly, of what will be Don's second state visit to the UK - I half expected him to follow up with a Lego model of the White House, or a special Trump Pez dispenser and a year's supply of cola-flavoured sweets for it. Alas, I'm unable to be equally scornful of Elon Musk's edict to federal employees that they tell him in an email of five things they accomplished in the last week. Oh yes, it's silly. Who'll look through these, and how will they check the enclosed bullet points aren't the work of the office satirist? But as a compulsive list-maker myself, my outrage is on the muted side. Sheepishly, I shuffle my notebooks, their closely written pages so replete with determination, wild ambition and pathos, I come off like some tragic hybrid of Adrian Mole and Martha Stewart. Oh, the striving. In terms of immediate action, I have three lists on the go at any one time: to do today; to do this week; to do at some point soon. But this is as nothing compared with my future achievement lists, of which I have dozens in play. These are floaty and nebulous, their headings along the lines of ""ideas"", ""thoughts"" or (how embarrassing) ""composers I should get into"". The most shaming of them is ""things I want"" (a painting by Ivon Hitchens or, failing that, a little bit of Chanel). As for year end lists, they take many guises, from praise (what did I do that anyone liked?) to all the new novels I read (old novels don't count). Protestant autodidact that I am, I simply cannot function without lists: several days ago, this column began as one - ""poss items for Notebook"" - and when it's complete, it'll be crossed off yet another. Living for three weeks without a boiler in a cold snap is an exercise in gratitude as well as stoicism. When the man from British Gas finally arrives to save us, I forgive him even when he accidentally smashes a favourite vase. I could kiss our fiercely hot radiators now, and may yet build some kind of household shrine in their honour. During this period of refrigeration, my fingers and toes began to burn and itch, which confused me at first. Perhaps our Captain Oates jokes were about to stop being funny. (""I'm just going outside, I may be some time,"" we would say, on leaving the only heated room.) But then I remembered: I'd been here before as a teenager. Kids, it was colder then, and our parents were more stingy with the thermostat. I had chilblains, a paradoxical Dickensian ailment that only becomes the more agonising when your extremities begin to warm up. after newsletter promotion To the National Portrait Gallery for an exhibition celebrating The Face magazine, which makes me mournful. Many of the faces on the walls - fashion designer Alexander McQueen, singer Steve Strange - are dead now, and while a few young people are milling around, blithely taking photos of photos, mostly the crowd is grey-haired and wearing trainers chosen for comfort rather than hipness. I used to work with the late stylist Isabella Blow, and it's always slightly guilt-inducing to stumble on her work. Back then, I was obsessed with her expenses, believing them to be bigger than my salary (I may not have been wrong). But here's a dazzling photograph (Taste of Arsenic) by Sean Ellis that she helped to conjure. It pushes all thoughts of taxi receipts clean from my mind.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T16:00:44.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/lists-notebooks-elon-musk
Trump has turbocharged the news cycle and I’m struggling to keep up,"T he smelly thoughts of Donald Trump bubble up like brown burps in the sort of bombsite pond Chopper bike-riding children were advised to avoid in 1970s public information films. Do they indicate concrete plans, are they designed to provoke, or do they have no meaning, like the gurgles and gasps that can inadvertently escape from a decomposing corpse? My job here is to try to anticipate if anything Trump says or does is likely to be of any lasting significance and to satirise it accordingly, in the small window of time allowed, for money. And it isn't getting any easier. Yes, Ukraine is suffering, but I am the real victim here. For example, last Saturday Trump opined: ""We were the richest... think of this, from 1870 to 1913... because we collected tariffs... We had so much wealth. Wouldn't it be nice today? Of course, now, we give it away to transgender this, to transgender that. Everybody gets a transgender operation. It's wonderful. We give it away to crazy things. But in those days, it was different. It was a different world. It was a different country."" Would Trump's notion of the damage caused to long-term American prosperity by transgender this surgery, and also to a lesser extent by transgender that surgery, gain any traction, and thus be deserving of the barbs of my quill, or would it be politely ignored as another crazy corpse bleat? I'm not a historian, though I do follow Prof Janina Ramirez on social media, but surely part of US prosperity in the period Trump describes was built on the proceeding two and a half centuries' use of free labour in the form of enslaved people stolen in their millions from Africa, their descendants finally getting the vote in 1965, when the Beatles' Help! was top of the UK charts; and also on the natural wealth appropriated from the country's Indigenous people, who were systematically ethnically cleansed and robbed of land and resources for which, conveniently, they hadn't really developed a notion of ownership as Europeans understood it. Have these beads, this whiskey and these smallpox-infected blankets. Thanks for all the pelts. Enjoy your dancing. To be fair to Trump, studies of Irish history, for instance, show that though three significant famines between 1740 and 1879 did affect the country economically, the main dent in the nation's finances was caused by the Roman Catholic church's liberal attitude to notions of gender, and by its demand that the Irish state fund transgender this surgery, and moreover transgender that surgery, for any Irish citizen requiring it, or for anyone who had even been just a little bit curious. I'm joking of course. Trump's idiotic Trump Theory of Transgender Economics TM (r) didn't stick and I wisely elected to ignore it in last week's column. But Trump continues to be a tough call. For 13 years, I filed these columns on Thursday mornings, hoping that I'd have anticipated any news developments that might destabilise my so-called ""jokes"" between the deadline and Sunday's publication. But last year I asked if I could start filing on Tuesdays, as various special-interest, right-leaning groups kept nibbling at the grey area between actionable exaggeration and exaggeration for comic effect, and I wanted to give the Observer's legal team time to protect me from imprisonment, having already experienced the spleen-dissolving stress of being co-targeted by Britain's final, and failed, attempt at a blasphemy prosecution in 2005. But now I'm back to filing at the last possible moment, 10am on Thursday. It's 9.15 now and I'm cross-checking the paragraphs that follow this sentence with live news updates to see if, perhaps, last week's Trump Theory of Transgender Economics TM (r) has suddenly resurfaced in a more vociferous form. Trump has turbocharged the news cycle and I'm a tortoise trying to spray-paint the side of speeding trains with clever satirical caricatures, James Gillray on a folding scooter. Those long wavy lines all along the carriages were supposed to be a drawing of Trump hanging a tea towel marked Ukraine out to dry. Or something. It's impossible. On Wednesday afternoon, the world briefly combusted when it appeared Trump's Truth Social feed had shared an impossibly offensive AI-generated film of his vision for Gaza's future . An image of a soldier pointing a gun at a Palestinian kid's head dissolves into liberated children running towards a Dubai-style resort, where Elon Musk eats hummus on a beach, bellydancers bellydance, a toddler tugs at a giant golden balloon of Trump's head, Trump apparently dances with a semi-naked woman, Musk and some infants dance in falling money, a gaudy Trump casino full of small golden effigies of Trump emerges from the ruins, Musk eats some more hummus but indoors this time, a giant golden statue of Trump bestrides a street scene and, finally, Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu drink cocktails by a pool in just their pants as a rapper raps: ""Trump Gaza number one!"" Theories erupted. Was Trump trying to bait the world? Or had Israel made the film to goad Hamas into breaking the ceasefire? Had Hamas made it to goad the outraged into attacking the US? But looking closely, it seems Trump is uncomfortably overfamiliar with the woman he is dancing with and the beach bellydancers are in fact men with beards in translucent dresses, in a country where transgender this and transgender that is yet to do the economic damage it has in the US. Had someone made an all too plausible satire of Trump's ethics and aesthetics that Trump himself had taken as an endorsement and shared online? Or did Trump know it was a parody and have so little regard for the human suffering in the region, he shared it anyway? It's impossible to know. All that is certain is that, as Steve Bannon advised , the zone is flooded with shit. And every week, it gets harder to wade through.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T10:00:05.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/trump-has-turbocharged-the-news-cycle-and-im-struggling-to-keep-up
"Black models, foreign films, queer culture – how the Face shaped me as a young man","I still remember the first copy of the Face magazine I bought at age 14. It was the January 1984 issue, with model and pop-rock singer Nick Kamen on the cover, in a ski cap. As a young kid, I bought magazines weekly, starting with Look-in, a preteen music and television magazine, followed by the brightly coloured teen bible Smash Hits and then the Face, the last two founded by Nick Logan. The Face was like a cool, older teenager who invited you into a sexy new world where fashion, music and design fused to create a revolutionary culture. As a young Black gay man, that invitation meant everything. This truly was the heyday of magazines, as I was reminded when visiting The Face Magazine: Culture Shift at the National Portrait Gallery last week. I was moved to see all of the magazine covers and spreads that I had collected and hung up on the walls in my youth. There was a particular image of the Kiss FM crew in their studio with Norman Jay, Gordon Mac and Paul ""Trouble"" Anderson, DJs whom I had loved and followed. When I was 16 and had left school, the Face opened a window into London's arts, music, clubbing, queer and fashion scene, which took me out of my small world in south London and allowed me to aspire to something different. Beyond the capital's walls, the magazine introduced me to the emerging house music scene in Chicago and New York, and foreign-language films. The 1980s and 90s are often described as something of a ""monoculture"", a period in which there was a shared participation in cultural phenomena - people watching the same shows and consuming the same music. But the decades saw an explosion of youth subcultures, and the Face revealed and brought together different tribes that were previously siloed off - rockabillies, rude boys, skinheads, soul heads, goths. What was important to me as a young person was that the Face told you that you didn't have to belong to one tribe; it could be cool for you to enjoy pop music and a bit of ska and a bit of soul. The Face also did not simply report on culture, it shaped it, and it helped me build a sense of style and identity. Images created by the Buffalo movement, a fashion collective headed up by the stylist Ray Petri and the photographer Jamie Morgan, often filled the pages and the cover. Buffalo had drawn on Jamaican culture, dancehall music and hip-hop, and embraced sports labels such as Lacoste, Fila and Sergio Tacchini. It also pioneered playing around with gender representation - putting men into leather skirts with combat boots; choosing steely, masculine depictions of women over glitter and elegance. The Face also used a diverse range of models, and had Black men as cover stars at a time when you would not see them in fashion stories or magazines anywhere else. It featured young Black male models now lost to history such as Tony Felix, Simon de Montfort and Wade Tolero . In June 1985, a month before I came out as gay to my family, the boxer Clinton McKenzie was on the cover of the Face in a beret with his muscles bursting out of his shorts and tank top. It's an image I still love now. That truly subversive, culture-defining era of magazines feels like a bygone era now. Perhaps I cannot claim, at age 55, to be completely tapped into the youth market, but the landscape of culture and the means of its dissemination are so much broader now. The decline of print magazines in the 2000s and 2010s was a consequence of the rise of the internet and social media, which spawned millions of cultural influencers and micro-trends. While magazines such as the Face weren't gatekeepers of culture, they were published by a select few people who set the narrative. Trends now feel much less substantial and much less consequential for popular culture. I remember being heartbroken when the Face closed down in 2004. While I had stopped collecting the magazine in the mid-90s, moving on to the more sophisticated GQ and Vanity Fair, it felt like one sign that we were entering a new era. The Face was founded at the beginning of the Thatcher era, and carried on through to New Labour and the explosion of Britpop. By the time it closed, the optimism of New Labour was crumbling, the advent of technology was not bringing the innovation and productivity gains for which we had hoped, and soon enough a financial crisis would appear on the horizon. The death of this truly British youth style bible - a symbol of growth, cultural revolution and promise - was the canary in the coalmine. I have followed the Face from a distance since its relaunch in 2019 and am pleased to see it back. Perhaps magazines cannot shape culture in the same way as they did in my youth. The pursuit of clicks means magazines, with their additional digital presence, are now doomed to follow trends rather than set them. However, the preservation of definitive print products feels vital when our culture is dominated by an online world in which our attention is infinitely split and an identity is hard to establish. Perhaps I'll go out and buy a copy again, even if I won't have the foggiest what anything in there means any more.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T15:06:01.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/black-models-foreign-films-queer-culture-how-the-face-shaped-me-as-a-young-man
‘Trump is abandoning Ukraine and wants a weaker EU’: Dominique de Villepin on Europe’s moment of truth,"D ominique de Villepin made his name with a memorable speech to the UN security council in February 2003, just before the US-led invasion of Iraq. De Villepin, the then French foreign minister, in effect signalled France's intention to veto a UN resolution authorising the war , forcing the US and UK to act unilaterally. He warned that Washington's strategy would lead to chaos in the Middle East and undermine international institutions. The prophetic plea was met with applause, a rare event in the security council chamber. It led to the career diplomat's inclusion as a character in David Hare's 2004 anti-war play, Stuff Happens . Now the veteran statesman, who warned about the risks of Europe's over-reliance on the US many years before it became a mainstream opinion in Paris or Berlin, is back with advice on how to respond to the most serious breakdown in Europe's relationship with the US in 80 years. As Donald Trump alienates America's oldest allies at alarming speed, European leaders are scrambling to adjust to the new, chaotic world order. But De Villepin believes there is also an opportunity for Europe to unite behind liberal democracy and fill the vacuum left behind by the Trump administration. He is convinced that there is an urgent need for European independence in defence, national security and technology. It is a reflection of the alarm in Europe that Paris, for the last month, has been bustling with visiting diplomats, premiers and heads of state. On Monday Emmanuel Macron became the first European leader to be welcomed to the White House since Trump's return to power. But Macron has also convened world leaders to discuss potential new coalitions of countries willing to step in to blunt the consequences of Trump's realignment on Ukraine and his apparent readiness to abandon liberal democracy. Trump's foreign policy is unpredictable, but he appears now to side with Russia over Ukraine . Even as Macron was at the White House attempting to salvage transatlantic ties, the US voted with Russia against a UN resolution condemning Vladimir Putin's war. North Korea and Belarus were among only a handful of other nations that followed the US. ""We now have three illiberal superpowers: Russia , China and the US,"" De Villepin says. ""America can no longer be considered an ally of Europe."" But he warns that the US will not prosper in this disordered, survival-of-the-fittest world it is creating, ""because they will be completely isolated"". He sees Trump's authoritarian turn as both a crisis and an opportunity for Europe to unite behind a new common purpose. ""The consequence of this will be a European awakening of democracy. We're going to fight for liberal democracy more than ever. Because the question now is really: sovereignty or submission."" Achieving European sovereignty sounds logical, but how do we get there? De Villepin suggests a three-point plan for a more assertive and independent continent. The first step is to develop a common defence pact in Europe, with a significant boost to the European defence industry. ""We urgently need to develop our own systems, and not just buy from the US."" The second is to increase investment in innovation and tech, as outlined in the Draghi report last year, which warned of an ""agonising decline"" for Europe in the absence of an EUR800bn annual spending boost. The third step is to strengthen Franco-British collaboration on defence, intelligence, nuclear issues and Ukraine, where De Villepin wants to see clear security guarantees in the event of a treaty and ceasefire. ""We have to take our destiny in our own hands,"" he says. ""Stop believing in illusions. Trump is abandoning Ukraine and [Elon] Musk is supporting extremist movements in Europe because they want a weaker EU. They understand that Europe is now the main obstacle for their vision. And this is, of course, not acceptable."" Does he support Ukraine's European - including French - allies putting boots on the ground to protect against a future Russian attack? ""As part of an agreed peacekeeping plan by the international community, I would support a French contribution."" Back in 2003, De Villepin's impassioned UN speech was delivered during a similar low point in transatlantic relations, with American neoconservatives renaming French fries "" freedom fries "" while rightwing news organisations labelled France and other European countries opposing the Iraq invasion an "" axis of weasels "". His challenge to George Bush's US, which drew on the painful wartime history underpinning the transatlantic alliance, remains acutely relevant in 2025. ""This message comes to you today from an old country, France , from an old continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity,"" he told the security council in 2003. ""A country that does not forget and knows everything it owes to the freedom fighters who came from America and elsewhere. And yet has never ceased to stand upright in the face of history and before mankind. Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community."" Rumours of a De Villepin run for the Elysee in 2027 have been circulating in the French media. He remains coy about a presidential ambition. What is clear, however, is that he thinks the next wave of national elections across Europe will be decided as much by national security and foreign affairs as by domestic issues. ""National security will be the most important issue for voters, because it's about liberty, values, whether we believe in sovereignty or submission."" This seems to be the rationale behind his return to public life - not just as a potential presidential candidate in France, but as the unofficial spokesperson for what he calls ""European sovereignty"". He used the phrase six times during our 90-minute conversation. ""With my background, my opposition to the Iraq war and all my experience of dealing with geopolitical crises, I felt that there were missing voices speaking up for the defence of Europe, the defence of our values, so it was my duty to speak up."" De Villepin belongs to a long tradition of French politicians sceptical of America's global supremacy, and now feels vindicated. But he's not pushing a dogmatic anti-Americanism. He has close ties to the US, studied there, and emphasises his respect for America's soft power, its universities, its culture of innovation. ""They are giving that up for this absurd idea of full power. They are ignoring history. You can never win with fire alone."" He forecasts that mass protests against Trump will emerge across the US as soon as the failures of his policies become evident. He predicts, like most economists, that the trade tariffs will lead to exploding inflation and layoffs, and that Trump's ""reckless"" foreign policy will make the country much weaker. ""This is always the problem for the nationalists and populists. What I call the principle of reality."" The problem, I suggest, is that the far right is waging war on reality, and it seems to be winning - at least in the US. In the presidential election last year, Trump won the popular vote with a small margin of 1.5 percentage points nationwide, but he won by an average of 54 points in ""news deserts"" , where few serious local media outlets are available, according to a study from Northwestern University. De Villepin sees this as an urgent call to build up the European tech industry and encourage independence from US platforms. ""Elon Musk wants a complete vassalisation of Europe and European media. So this is a question of our fundamental liberties, and our freedom to think what we want to think. We need to build our own tools, whether it's LLMs [large language models], social platforms or cloud tech. We have to understand that this is a state of emergency."" Before Germany's general election on 23 February, Musk campaigned frenetically for the far right AfD, but to less effect than he might have hoped for. The party was polling at about 20% when Musk embraced it and ended up with 20.8% of the vote . De Villepin does not believe that a Musk intervention in favour of the far right would be particularly successful in France, either. ""Oh, it would be the surest way for Le Pen to lose, if Elon Musk came here to campaign with her."" Jordan Bardella, the youthful president of Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, cancelled a trip to a rightwing conference in the US after the former Trump aide Steve Bannon made what appeared to be a Nazi salute at the event. De Villepin predicts that Le Pen will try to keep some distance between herself and Trump's Maga movement, but he insists they are ideological twins. ""She's very close to Russia. Close to these ideas. Anti-globalisation, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism. So they're completely linked."" His own path to a potential presidential candidacy might be filled with obstacles and contradictions. As a pro-Palestinian, moderate conservative Gaullist, he could struggle to get past the first round. But he clearly sees a political future where his foreign policy experience will top most immediate domestic concerns. For now, he says, European nationalists can gather, as they did recently in Madrid, laud Trump and pledge to ""make Europe great again"" - but soon, he believes, Trump will be a toxic brand in Europe. ""This is an opportunity for Europe to be the voice of stability,"" he says. ""Because here, we know the consequences of authoritarian nationalism.""",the Guardian,2025-03-01T06:00:34.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/trump-is-abandoning-ukraine-and-wants-a-weaker-eu-dominique-de-villepin-on-europes-moment-of-truth
Trump said Zelenskyy ‘does not have the cards’. But how well is he playing his own hand?,"T he White House meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be remembered as far more than just a diplomatic disaster. It marked the end of international politics as we know it, and was a harbinger for the sunset of Pax Americana. Zelenskyy, reeling from the meeting, arrived in London on Saturday to attend a defence summit with other European leaders. Thanks to Trump's performance, those leaders now have clarity on where the US government stands on the war in Ukraine - and, more broadly, on how US foreign policy may look in future. It is hard to overstate what a departure this is. Since the end of the second world war, the US has been the primary architect and guarantor of an intricate network of global institutions anchored by Nato, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. Together, these partners crafted a security umbrella whose benefits far outweighed its expense. It produced political stability and provided US and European companies with unrivalled access to markets and resources. The US was all too happy to share the gains of this order with its allies, and, to a lesser extent, with its rivals and adversaries. True, the US reaped the greatest benefits : it set the terms of trade and projected its influence on to the globe. But the order was inclusive, since its institutions were designed to deliver benefits that everyone could enjoy, even if access was unequal. It had plenty of critics, drawing envy and ire from adversaries such as Russia and China, whose leaders regularly grumbled about unfairness and demanded their seats at the table. Over time, the US and its allies grew accustomed to the status quo, comfortable and complacent to the point of letting their military stockpiles deplete and degrade . By contrast, Russia and China cultivated networks of propagandists, corrupt officials and saboteurs, who shared a common goal: to identify the west's weak points, amplify political instability and undermine western unity. They could hardly have hoped for a more vulnerable and divided west. From the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, to rising nationalist movements across Europe and, most consequentially, Trump's ascendance to the presidency, the last decade has been marked by events that have weakened transatlantic ties and eroded security arrangements. Trump's criticisms of Nato and other longstanding alliances have helped to convince American voters that US allies are more of a burden than a benefit. In this context, the meeting with Zelenskyy, when Trump told the Ukrainian leader "" make a deal or we're out "", was not entirely surprising. The president has consistently framed foreign policy in transactional terms, prioritising one-time payouts over the long-term dividends that arise from international stability and cooperation. His approach reflects a total indifference to defending democratic principles or countering authoritarian influence, whether in Russia or elsewhere. His foreign policy is defined by unpredictability, quick gains and self-interest. Trump is also uninterested in confronting aggressors. In fact, he's not averse to trading other's security for his own gain. As Zelenskyy pointed out, the US is shielded from Russian aggression by an ocean, a luxury that Europe does not enjoy. Trump appears content to let Europe manage its own security, ignoring the reality that European stability is intrinsically linked to US economic and strategic interests. In his willingness to work with Vladimir Putin, he is ignoring the fact that the existing international system has overwhelmingly benefited the US. Ironically, the world order that Putin advocates for - one shaped by imperial spheres of influence, rather than collective security - would come at significant costs to the US. In his exchange with Zelenskyy, Trump invoked a metaphor of a card game. Yet his own cards are spread across the table. He will probably use the fallout from the meeting to convince domestic Republican holdouts to halt sending decommission-ready military equipment to Ukraine and lift sanctions against Russia. He and Putin will probably extol the dubious economic opportunities that America could seize in Russia , trading secure and lucrative European markets for the higher risk, smaller Russian market, which his Maga-aligned elites may embrace. Europe can either stand back, accept this new reality, and hope that Russia's imperial ambitions stop at Ukraine . Or it can adapt to a world without US support, where it has to take a more assertive role in its own defence and strategic decision-making. Historically, cohesion across the continent has been difficult to achieve. The stakes are now higher than ever. For Ukraine, the path forward remains difficult. This meeting did not cost it US support - that was set in motion by Trump's re-election. Zelenskyy was right not to be bullied into a ceasefire on Russia-dictated terms. Without security guarantees, such an agreement would be disastrous for Ukraine. Trump would claim an easy diplomatic victory, using it as a justification to cut military aid and lift sanctions on Russia. But as Zelenskyy noted, Putin has a history of breaking ceasefires. With sanctions eased, Russia would simply rearm and prepare for another offensive against a weakened Ukraine. By resisting Trump's pressure, Zelenskyy may still face the same outcome, but at least Ukraine remains unshackled from a one-sided truce. Even without US support, Ukraine is in a stronger position militarily and diplomatically than it was in early 2022. As dire as things look at the moment, international politics is rarely static, and Trump himself is known for reversals. It remains possible that he could again shift course , signing the minerals deal with Ukraine and mending relations with European allies. There is always a small chance that the meeting was just an embarrassing and emotional mishap. But with its sovereignty at stake, chance is not something Ukraine can count on.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T15:11:20.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-us-ukraine-america
International aid is as vital as defence spending – cutting either undermines British security,"N ational defence and international development are two sides of the same coin. Our long-term security requires us to invest in both. European nations need to fill any vacuum left by America's new administration as we ensure there can be no victory for Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and Donald Trump's decision to shut down USAid . Before being elected as an MP, I lived in Kenya and saw the vital work done by local charities that help families of children growing up in informal settlements on the outskirts of Nairobi. I met teenagers working on social media projects to tackle disinformation and prevent post-election violence. And I talked to women about the ever-present threat of rape and sexual violence. Like many African countries Kenya has huge potential, but it also has a violent recent history and is plagued by the threat of international terrorism. So when the US or the UK withdraws funding for clinics offering sexual and reproductive health services, young women can't take control of their lives. When the US or the UK withdraws funding for schemes to combat young men being fed disinformation, the risk is that they become more easily recruited by malign actors, armed groups and even terrorist networks. China and Russia have their own agendas around the world. They are pushing vulnerable countries into debt, offering investment opportunities that ignore violations to human rights. They seek influence as part of their global agenda to destabilise the international rules-based system. They undermine copyright and intellectual property. They seek to exploit, rather than to support. As the experience of the BBC World Service shows, when the UK or the US gives up bandwidth, China and Russia move in with their disinformation campaigns. When we fail to make the case to support fledgling and imperfect democracies to promote good governance, we fail to explain that the resulting corruption and exploitation undermines societies and can lead to wars, more UK asylum claimants and destabilisation that ultimately puts the UK's security at risk. Since becoming an MP, I have had the huge privilege of joining the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme . This has allowed me to better understand the experience of the veterans who helped elect me. It has also allowed me to hear first-hand the security analysis and threat assessment of Britain's brightest military brains . It is clear that the UK is under significant and immediate threat from Russia and other oligarchies that do not believe in human rights, international law and humanity. The cuts that the Conservative government made to the defence budget were negligent and bolstered the ego of Putin and other enemies. We need to get defence spending back to the 2.5% it was under the last Labour government and we need to go further to at least 3% as quickly as possible. Where diplomacy and development fail, we need a defence deterrent that other countries fear and that can win wars. The military have been some of the most passionate advocates of the fact that defence and development are closely related. They have been witness to what happens when we fail in our military, our diplomacy or our aid activity to bring stability to a vulnerable country. It is not just the lives lost and ruined; it creates a real threat to the UK itself. The world is beset by conflicts and huge numbers of displaced people. This has happened at a time when the UK has behaved as a small island worrying only about itself, and cut its military and international aid. If a fragile peace can take hold in Gaza and Ukraine , the rebuilding efforts and vital humanitarian support will need to go hand-in-hand with peacekeeping efforts. Our investment overseas can help turn these war-torn countries from humanitarian crises to vibrant democracies and trading partners. With climate change already a reality, overseas partnerships are needed to help people adapt to extreme weather events. And for all our efforts in the UK to reach net zero, we can't save the planet on our own. We need to support the participation of countries that did the least to cause climate change but are already experiencing its worst impacts. That's in our national interest and fundamental to our security. after newsletter promotion Because a world where food and water are scarce is a world where governments are destabilised, people are displaced and conflicts are deepened. It's not just good Samaritans and bleeding-heart liberals who look beyond our shores and see the threat and the pain. It is those who understand that we live on a planet where we cannot isolate ourselves from what happens beyond our borders. But the UK and our allies have failed to make the case that a balance between Britain's national defence and our spending overseas is necessary for the UK's security and success. And because of that, we are all less safe.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T07:00:04.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/international-aid-is-as-vital-as-defence-spending-cutting-either-undermines-british-security
Welcome back Billy McFarland and a new Fyre festival. Shows you can’t keep a good fantasist down,"""S ince 2016, Fyre has been the most talked about festival in the world,"" organiser Billy McFarland told a US broadcaster when tickets for Fyre 2 went on sale this week. McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison for wire fraud in 2018, related to his organisation of the first Fyre (he served only four). Whatever you think about the first Fyre - with its limp cheese sandwiches, its disaster-relief-tent accommodation, the absence of advertised headliners, the $26m of unpaid debt, the rats (were the rats influencer hyperbole? Perhaps, but on the other hand the festival happened on the parking lot of an abandoned resort development, and where else is a rat supposed to live?), you have to admit it lived up to one promise: it was legendary . Wire fraud is any swindling that happens electronically, whether by text, email, phone or social media. It's so easy to fall on the wrong side of that - you could commit it just by sending a round robin, asking for a million dollars. Really, all that is standing between so many of us and jail is the sucker who will give us a million dollars. It's really the suckers who belong in prison, if you think about it. Anyway, back to McFarland. ""Obviously, a lot of that [talk] has been negative ... but if it's done well, I think Fyre has the chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry,"" he said . To throw the guy a bone, he built a huge amount of global notoriety over a very short time, and it would be a shame not to monetise this. Promotion for Fyre 1 started in December 2016, and by 27 April 2017, the festival had become a universal analogy for everything in the world that was bad. People who had flocked there, paying from $500 to $12,000 for tickets, had responded to the siren call of models and actors advertising the festival on Instagram. Within hours, it was the white-hot centre of schadenfreude. This tribe of festivalgoers had something deeper in common than merely being fools who had parted with their money. They had made certain assumptions about the festival, assuming it would form a backdrop for a fabricated life they could project on their socials. To witness their horror at sodden mattresses and cancelled flights, queues stretching hours to arrive at a wasteland, had the satisfying comeuppance of an Enid Blyton book. Look who got too big for their boots, and now their boots are full of untreated sewage. But this was only the overture. As the festival was cut short and the lawsuits began, the full hubris of McFarland unfurled. Professionals from every festival-related sector had lined up to tell him his investment wasn't enough, his prep time was too short, he didn't have the experience or skills or networks he needed, and he forged on anyway, becoming the poster boy for unhinged self-belief. In a world so dominated by the virtual, public shame has become the last line of defence against shitehawks faking it till they make it. What's to stop a crypto bro simply saying he's a billionaire until he is one? What stands between a very humble genius ascending to the point that he can assert his genius and humility by executive order? It's a dicey old game. Sometimes, reality wins ( Sam Bankman-Fried ); other times, it loses (Donald Trump). So when the results land and it is Crowd 1 Naked Emperor 0, people really savour that. Besides the monsoon that arrived at Fyre 1, turning a bleak and comfortless event into one that posed an active hazard to public health, there was one other stroke of incredible bad luck for McFarland: his wasn't the only enterprise mired in chaos. Trump had commenced his first term in office, splashing falsehood over everything, and firing cabinet members and staff during infantile tantrums. In Britain, we were in that nightmarish first phase of Brexit, when it was still impossible to believe that people so unprepared, so thoughtless and so histrionic could be steering the ship. Over time, ""this is like the Fyre festival"" became the standard expression of dismay to describe a range of political developments. For at least some of this long period, McFarland would have been in prison. Hopefully, for his own sake, he missed the extent of his gift to the English language, a shorthand for incompetence so profound that it defies analysis. But Fyre 2 ""isn't about the past"", McFarland says. This time he's dreaming bigger, with the most expensive tickets priced at $1.1m. You have to love the audacity of that last $100,000. The so-called ""Prometheus pass"" gets you access to the fight team next to the ""fight pit"", and really, who knows what that means - maybe you get to be beaten unconscious by Tyson Fury, or maybe it's just a ringside seat to a thumb wrestle between two marketing managers, and the surprise is part of the point, guys, because ""the origin of the Prometheus pass is shrouded in secrecy ... Legend has it that it was inspired by the titan Prometheus"". Huh, yeah, sounds plausible. Can't think of any other Prometheuses. Fyre 1 ignited because it was a harbinger of shitshows to come. The remake looks like the supremacy of the fantasists. What could be more 2025?",the Guardian,2025-02-27T14:34:12.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/billy-mcfarland-new-fyre-festival-fantasist
"No matter how distasteful we find Trump and Vance over Europe, they speak a blunt truth","I t's tough being rightwing these days. You have to find something nice to say about Donald Trump. That is hard. He thinks Kyiv started the Ukraine war and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is a "" dictator "". But what about JD Vance? The US vice-president thinks that Europe's "" threat from within "", which is putting ""free speech ... in retreat"", is worse than any threat from Russia or China. These men are deranged. What more is there to say? The answer is quite a lot. John Stuart Mill warned that ""he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that"". We must try to understand the case they are making, whether we agree with it or not. Yes, these men are mendacious and hypocritical. Trump claims that Zelenskyy ""refuses to have elections"" and that he is ""very low in the polls"" despite recent polling showing that he still has a majority of Ukrainian support . As for the threat to free speech ""from within"", the Associated Press is banned from White House briefings for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America"", and Trump's friend Elon Musk thinks CBS's ""lying"" journalists "" deserve a long prison sentence "" . Trump/Vance have cut through half a century of consensual waffle about the US's God-given destiny to lead the world to goodness and freedom. Whether the issue is peace and war, immigration or tariffs, they claim to seek the US's self-interest and nothing else. Why should Americans fork out billions each year to defend a Europe that fails to defend itself? Why should they arm distant nations to fight their neighbours, or tip staggering amounts of aid into Africa's basket cases? If the rest of the world has screwed up - while the US has stayed free and rich for two and a half centuries - that is the world's problem. Americans have spent a fortune these past 50 years trying to improve life on Earth and, frankly, it has failed. To hell with diplomatic etiquette. As for Ukraine, enough is enough. Putin is not going to invade the US, nor has he any intention of invading western Europe. If Europe wants to pretend otherwise, champion Vladimir Putin's foes, sanction and enrage him, it can do so alone. Nato was a Hitler/Stalin thing. It was just another device to make the US pay for Europe's defence. Not any more. The US, says the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth , ""is no longer the primary guarantor of security in Europe"". Bang goes plausible nuclear deterrence. In reality, these talking points are not new, though they have not previously been expressed so brutally by an administration. In various guises, they have lurked beneath the surface of US isolationism for more than a century. To win an election, Woodrow Wilson swore that the first world war was ""one with which we have nothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us"". Franklin Roosevelt promised the same of the second. He promised American mothers ""again and again and again, your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars"". Neither kept his word. US public opinion can be patriotic when a war is on, as during Vietnam. But otherwise it has been persistently anti-interventionist. Kennedy might have pleaded global sacrifice and to ""ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man"". But that was largely fine words for foreign consumption. What Trump/Vance are now saying to western Europe is get serious. The cold war is over. You know Russia has no desire to occupy western Europe. This proclaimed threat is a fantasy got up by what a wise president, Dwight Eisenhower, called the US's military-industrial complex, long practised at extracting profit from fear. If Keir Starmer really wants ""to give priority to defence"", he can slash his own health and welfare budgets to pay for it. But is he really that threatened, or does it merely sound good? Joe Biden was meticulous in the degree of help he extended to Kyiv. Now is the inevitable moment of extrication, but it will require a very difficult ceasefire to precede it. Without a substantial guarantee from Washington, it is hard to see anything other than eventual defeat for Kyiv. Ukraine could yet prove a rerun of the US in South Vietnam. With a minimum of delicacy, Trump/Vance have decided to expose the mix of platitude, bluff and profiteering that underpinned much of the cold war. Nato's victory in 1989 suggested the need for a shift to a more nuanced multipolar world, one that was never properly defined. Trump/Vance are right that a realignment is badly needed. They have chosen the worst possible moment and the worst possible way to say it. We can be as rude to them as we like, but they will have US democracy on their side.",the Guardian,2025-02-21T12:00:36.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/21/donald-trump-jd-vance-europe-us-realignment
"Well done for surviving the Trump test, PM. But our true friends are in Europe","I f a week is a long time in politics, a week dominated by the fascination and fear as to what President Trump may do next is an eternity. Fresh off the plane from Washington, Keir Starmer will spend this weekend hosting the great and good of our continent as they take stock of prospects for Ukraine. For the third time since the second world war - after Suez in 1956 and Iraq in 2003 - the United Kingdom is being forced to work out where it stands between the US and Europe. In the aftermath of those past crises, Britain chose to hug the US as tightly as possible, even if that meant drifting away from European friends. The prime minister appears to have secured a diplomatic coup in getting through his crunch encounter with Donald Trump mostly unscathed. But don't let bonhomie and bad taste comments about wives fool you: we are still in crisis, and the old routine won't save us. Now is not the time for victory laps of the lobby over good headlines or the special relationship. If the past week has reinforced anything, it is how delicate are our prosperity and security, and that both now find stronger sustenance in Europe. The president may enjoy the pageantry of a second state visit, but six weeks into office he's made it crystal clear his alliances are based not on grand ideals of shared values but profit margins. In negotiating with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine's head while humiliating President Zelenskyy, Trump has shown that we can no longer assume that when push comes to shove, US core interests will align with ours. Indeed, even hard interests appear negotiable if they interfere with the bottom line. Take critical minerals, the vital lifeblood of our advanced economies. Trump has strong-armed Zelenskyy into signing over preferential access to the revenues from Ukraine's national deposits. This comes just weeks after the UK signed its own 100-year partnership with Ukraine that included plans to work together on these very same resources - a promise our government is yet to say can still hold. Meanwhile, there are reports that the US is gearing up to work directly with Russia to extract natural resources in the Arctic. Trump may have restated his own liking for Brexit, but it has left us outside the room at a time of high peril. Every nation recognises the need to pour oil on the troubled waters of international affairs at present. Yet we cannot take for granted that our neighbours will be pleased to hear talk of exempting us from the same tariffs being used to threaten their own growth. With stakes this high, now is not the time to indulge rehashed scare stories about cooperation with Europe from the Conservatives, or ignore the vacillation over standing up to Putin from Reform . Nor should we be distracted by the perennial rabbit hole of whether to rejoin the EU - or let either side derail the reset of relationships by old enmities. Instead of red lines, it's time to talk shared interests. These will not be achieved if either side delays a new strategic trade partnership for the sake of arguments over fisheries policy. Nor can the UK be asked to fight for Europe, but at the same time be cut out of deals to finance crucial defence industries. British businesses need us to ruthlessly reduce the paperwork currently crippling trade with Europe. The British exchequer needs us to link our emissions trading schemes so that we won't face a multibillion-pound bill when the EU's new border charge comes into force. With energy security crucial to our ability to stand up to Putin as well as cutting the cost of living, there is also mutual interest in working at pace with our neighbours on the renewable energy potential of the North Sea - and to protect crucial undersea cables from sabotage. History shows that when the UK has tried to please everyone, our international reputation - and influence - has diminished for decades afterwards. The prime minister has this week carefully walked a tightrope. It is a start, but it isn't an answer as to how to secure our own interests in such uncertain times. From intelligence to nuclear weapons, our national security apparatus is tightly bound to the US . So, too, our volume of trade with Europe outweighs any hysteria about a hypothetical new deal with the US that could be years in negotiations. Realpolitik requires cold, hard calculation now more than ever. Even if we can keep the special relationship intact, it is across the Channel, not the Atlantic, that Britain will need to look first to protect our citizens' prosperity and security. After the circus, the real lion-taming starts now.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T12:06:20.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-donald-trump-us-uk-europe
"After a week of turmoil, one thing needs saying about our NHS: slowly it is healing","R eorganisation - or re-disorganisation - is the perennial disease in the NHS . If I listed all the structural acronyms throughout the decades, and the new staff starting new jobs with new brass nameplates, it would fill this page. This week, Wes Streeting accepted the resignation of NHS England's chief executive, Amanda Pritchard , after ousting its chair, Richard Meddings , signalling an effective merger in all but name with Streeting's own department. Whitehall says NHS England will have ""a smaller, leaner role"", with thousands of duplicated jobs lost. Few people will regret the swallowing up of this remnant of the disastrous 2012 Lansley reforms, which fragmented everything in the NHS. Pritchard and Meddings recently suffered an unwarranted pasting by the Commons public accounts and health committees for their lack of ""ideas"" , but that was hardly fair. They had been barred from revealing the health department's imminent 10-year plan. And there is a truth that the committees ignored that bears stating here: the NHS is on the turn for the better. Jim Mackey takes over NHS England , and even those who say Pritchard got the push unfairly tell me they welcome his arrival. Currently CEO of Newcastle hospitals foundation trust, he was head of NHS Improvement with a record of innovation until it was abolished by one of the three Tory health secretaries passing through in 2022. It's also worth saying that Pritchard suffered six changes of health secretary in three and half years. I interviewed Mackey two years ago when he had returned to Northumbria healthcare trust, to start a pioneering scheme that others now copy. Failure to bind social care with the NHS leaves more than 13,000 beds in England taken up by old people waiting for a care package. Mackey set up a care system within his trust to relieve hospital bed shortages. His Northumbria Care is an NHS-owned domiciliary service that bids for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers, seamlessly integrating care within the health service. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, and every incentive to stop patients needing a hospital bed, and to get them home quicker. He planned to build care homes to take over residential contracts too, if he could raise the capital. The idea short-circuits the cumbersome introduction of 42 integrated care boards (ICBs). They were designed to bring local services together, but are largely regarded as failing. They lack the clout to knock local heads together so that GP and community services integrate with hospitals. They have no power over integrating local authority social care. Half the ICBs are in debt; they may yet be merged into half that number. Rarely has top talent moved from hospitals to run ICBs. Instead, many hospitals are forming groups, which may work better than ICBs. These are not big-bang changes and they slide under the radar, but the Mackey model has inspired other trusts to try similar schemes: expect more of that thinking from him. The Darzi report laid bare the state of the NHS Labour inherited . Austerity cut everything, including medical training, with huge gaps in staff as the NHS struggled to cope with the effects of deprivation and a far sicker population. Streeting is rightly wary of boasting about any progress yet, given public outrage over the still appalling waiting lists (7.46 million cases, according to the British Medical Association ), as well as ambulance delays, and ailing A&E and GP services . The Treasury, meanwhile, seems happy to say that NHS productivity is lagging and that extra money ploughed in is failing to produce enough improvement. But that's not the whole story, and the NHS should speak up. The Treasury traditionally sees the NHS as a bottomless pit, but its productivity is being badly misrepresented with faulty Office for National Statistics figures that are eagerly seized on by enemies of the NHS on the right. Anita Charlesworth, senior economist at the Health Foundation thinktank, says ONS figures only count acute hospital activity, leaving out the 12,000 new virtual hospital-at-home beds. These are costly, but less expensive than actual hospital beds. The stats leave out GP care. Productivity there is rising fast now that GPs are paid to seek advice from specialists, instead of automatically referring patients to them directly: 1.5 million fewer patients have been referred, the department tells me. Instead, they are being cared for in surgeries under guidance. That GP productivity should be counted in. The department's own figures show waiting lists falling and the 2m extra appointments promised within a year have been provided months early, with surgical hubs working evenings and weekends, as well as new diagnostic units. In his last month as chair, Meddings points to widespread improvements, a service ""overwhelmed"", but not ""broken"", he tells me. GP appointments are rising fast: 98% of surgeries have digital phones ensuring every call is answered, or called back promptly, with half the callers getting same-day appointments, and 70% face-to-face consultations. April's year end figures will show ""NHS productivity up 2.5%, more than any other public service"", Meddings said. He echoed the curious optimism you often hear throughout the NHS, even from those who describe near-impossible tasks undertaken to cope with rising need. Keep perspective. Trolleys line many A&E corridors, ambulance delays persist, waiting times are horrendous. I hear laments from managers and medics facing the prospect of 4% ""efficiency savings"" next year, to be achieved on top of already existing deficits, which must also be cleared. (Spoiler alert: they won't be.) But there is hope. Times are tough and funding remains below the NHS historic average. But, as the Health Foundation's Charlesworth says, this is not a repeat of the NHS austerity years. Statistics are just that, and what they represent cuts through very slowly, so it will take a long time before the public feels and believes in progress. But, for all the turmoil, green shoots are there.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T08:00:51.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/nhs-slowly-healing-under-labour
"From ‘salam’ shower gel to ‘ethnic’ bedding, firms want to celebrate Ramadan. But some can’t even spell ‘iftar’","S upermarkets have wheeled out the 20kg bags of rice. High-street stores have popped hijabs on mannequins. Cosmetic companies are churning out products scented with pomegranate, cardamom, saffron and ""sticky date"" - at Lush you can buy Salam shower gel, Noor lip butter and a massage bar that apparently smells like a turmeric latte. All this can only mean one thing in our modern, consumerist world: Ramadan is upon us. Ramadan, the holiest month in the Muslim calendar, begins this weekend. Like many Muslims, I find it is my favourite time of the year (and not because I can bulk-buy rice for the entire year in my local Tesco). It is a time of spiritual growth and reflection, of turning away from our own desires and egos to focus on God, and of letting go of the trappings of the earthly world - including food and drink in daylight hours. Over the past few years , perhaps thanks to social media, Ramadan has become increasingly commercialised as major companies wake up to how lucrative the so-called Muslim pound is - estimated to be worth more than PS20.5bn . But this year things feel more unabashedly consumerist than ever. For weeks now, my social media feeds have been inundated with influencers (sponsored by major corporations - one of which even manages to misspell iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal, on its website) telling us that getting ready for Ramadan means a new decor theme in every room, brand new personalised prayer mats for the entire family or a whole new wardrobe for visits to the mosque. Of course, there has always been the concept of preparing ahead for Ramadan. Muslim mothers and grandmothers have spent the days before mass-producing samosas since time immemorial. But traditionally this has been about getting ahead of tasks such as cooking to maximise time spent on worship during the holy month. In the past, getting ready for Ramadan has never meant changing all the bedding to something more vaguely ethnic looking or restocking our lipstick collection in desert hues. We can thank capitalism for that one. OK, you could argue that this is nothing new. We are used to what capitalism has done to anything with meaning in our superficial world. Look at what has become of Christmas. But it feels as though things are getting worse: as though spirituality itself - the cornerstone of the holy month - has become commodified. It's not only the push to be a better consumer that detracts from the spiritual meaning of Ramadan for me; it's that I feel as though I am being turned into a product to sell. The fast-paced, goals-driven world we live in has turned productivity into the end goal. We are constantly tracking everything in our lives - our steps, our calorie intakes, our career wins - so that we can share our progress on social media for the world to consume. We are bombarded with the idea that we must constantly strive, always be improving. And this has seeped into Ramadan too. Instead of approaching the month with a focus on introspection and on our personal relationship with our faith, productivity culture is telling us we should track our prayer goals, map our fasting progress and be in constant competition (with ourselves, they say, but really with each other). The concept of a quiet month spent escaping the trappings of our modern world is completely lost when we are being assaulted from all angles with the idea that we can productivity-hack a connection with God. And for Muslims like me, whose Ramadan can't be about smashing targets (this will be my first as a mother of two, with a lively toddler and a newborn baby in tow), it can feel intimidating and isolating. Feeling as though I have failed before it has even started, I have had to remind myself that the holy month isn't about buying new things or praying more than someone on Instagram - but it's hard when the algorithms tell me otherwise. It could be said that visibility is a form of progress. But all of these apparent celebrations of Islam come against a background of surging Islamophobia, with assaults rising by 73% in 2024. Since last summer's riots, being Muslim in Britain feels more precarious than ever. And while the Ramadan ranges in stores may look like progress, they ultimately do nothing to challenge the Islamophobia that is embedded in the systems that govern our lives. There was once a time when it seemed refreshing to see ourselves represented in supermarkets and high-street brands. Seeing a hijabi mannequin in Primark would have once stopped me in my tracks, and ""Ramadan Mubarak"" signs in Sainsbury's used to make me smile. But now it feels devoid of meaning - and, if anything, disingenuous and even sinister. Even when I do finally see myself represented in mainstream culture, do I then have to worry about how that will enrage racists and certain sections of the media? There is a difference between tick-box diversity on the shelf and genuine diversity and inclusion in a country. Meaningful change would be acknowledging the ways British Muslims remain disfranchised and afraid, rather than pacifying us with date-scented goods and vats of oil at discount prices.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T08:00:34.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/ramadan-salam-shower-gel-religious-festival-not-consuming
Trump is the world’s greatest showman – and the weakest strongman it has ever seen,"H e parades as a strongman, but in fact he's weak, weak, weak. In the face of America's adversaries Donald Trump is, as he might put it, a patsy, a sucker, a pushover. He folds like a pack of cards. He's a human doormat. A loser. Just consider the gifts he has handed Vladimir Putin this week. He has brought Russia in from the diplomatic cold after three years of ostracism following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, whose anniversary is nearly upon us. Sergei Lavrov, Putin's foreign minister, was meant to be persona non grata; he remains under international sanctions . Nevertheless, this week in Riyadh he met Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in so-called peace talks . The mere fact of that meeting gave Putin something he has long desired: parity with the US. It signalled that Washington regards Moscow as its equal: not a pariah state that has committed an unconscionable act of aggression, but a fellow great power, even superpower, to be treated with respect. Whatever was agreed in Saudi Arabia, Putin will chalk that up as a win. But Trump's generosity did not end there. For who was not in the room in Riyadh? Answer: the Ukrainians . Remember, these were talks to discuss the future of Ukraine. To end a war in Ukraine. After the invasion of Ukraine. The exclusion of Ukrainians from discussions to determine their own future is obviously an enormous concession to Putin: it ensures he ends the war on his terms. But it's a gift of a deeper kind too. It implicitly endorses Putin's claim that Ukraine is not a real country, that it was only ever a province of the great Russian motherland with no sovereignty of its own. There were others shut out in Saudi Arabia, and their exclusion was another kindness to the Russian dictator. The nations of Europe were not represented, even though they have a direct stake in what happens on their eastern frontier. They have been allies of Kyiv, aiding in the defence of Ukraine , and therefore their presence was deemed too uncongenial to the Russians. So they were not invited. Again, though, this concession contained another, larger one. For what is one of the great strategic goals of Putin, which explains so much of his activity over recent years, including his meddling in foreign elections? It is the fragmenting of the western alliance. He loved Brexit, cheers on the far right in Europe and backed Trump because he wants to see the crumbling of the western bloc that has stood firm against him. For a US president to follow that script, icing out America's most longstanding allies, is a huge win for the Kremlin. Not least because it came straight after the US vice-president, JD Vance, had travelled to Munich - a city whose name will for ever be associated with the appeasement of dictators - to berate the democracies of Europe, lecturing them on free speech and culture wars, while making no mention of Russia's suppression of all dissent, manifested in the unfortunate tendency of Putin's internal critics to end up dead. All of this would have represented a spectacular set of concessions to Moscow. But there was more. For one thing, Trump's comically unqualified defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had earlier warned Ukraine that it would never recover the lands stolen from it by Russia and that it should abandon all dreams of joining Nato. Again, two more items on Putin's wishlist ticked off. But then, Trump posted a social media rant that echoed a raft of Putin's favourite talking points. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ""A Dictator without Elections,"" Trump wrote, massively unpopular with his own people, ripping off the west as Ukraine corruptly swallows up billions of dollars. To cap it all, he endorsed the Orwellian, black-is-white inversion of truth advanced by the Kremlin when he said: ""You should have never started it."" As if it were Ukraine that invaded Russia three years ago, rather than the other way around. That, then, is everything Trump handed to Putin in the last week or so. And what has he got in return? Nothing, save flattery and the dangled promise of lucrative energy deals with Moscow. Indeed, he did not so much as ask for anything in return. The supposed strongman fell to his knees and kissed the Russian dictator's feet before they had even entered the negotiating chamber. Small wonder that Kurt Volker, who resigned as Trump's point man on Ukraine in 2019, told me for the latest Politics Weekly America podcast that the president has a ""blind spot on Putin,"" one Volker admits he does not understand. All of which makes it laughable for Trump to claim he is ""successfully negotiating an end to the war"", something only he could do, or for his cheerleaders to hail ""the art of the peace deal"" , or indeed for the meeting in Riyadh to be described as ""peace talks"" at all. They are nothing of the kind. If you give one side everything they want, which they naturally accept, while denying the other side everything they need, which they naturally reject, that is not a peace agreement: it is nothing more than a coerced surrender. Anybody could do that. It is no achievement at all. And Trump has form in this area, the supposed master of the deal repeatedly giving away everything and getting nothing in return. Recall his photo-op meeting with Kim Jong-un in 2018. The North Korean tyrant and ruler of a slave state was rewarded with the legitimacy of a summit with - and the effusive praise of - a US president. Kim also won a suspension of US military exercises in the Korean peninsula. These were concrete, high-value gains. In return, Kim conceded nothing but some vague aspirations for a world without nuclear weapons. He played Trump like a slot machine. To be clear, presidential weakness is not the gravest sin here. More serious is the capitulation to a dictator, the acquiescence in an invasion and the lasting precedent it sets, the abandonment of an ally fighting for its life and an apparent decision to break apart an alliance that has delivered relative peace and prosperity to the west, including the US, for eight decades. Trump's explainers say he's doing this for a hard-headed reason : to end the distraction of a war that does not affect the US directly, so that it can focus its resources on the real threat, China. But even judged on its own terms, this move is a failure. Because a broken west makes a future dominated by China more, not less, likely. The rest of the west, including Britain, needs to decide very quickly how to navigate the new world that emerged with vivid clarity this week. The postwar era is over. The global architecture built in 1945 is being burned to the ground by Trump. Europeans need to plan for, and invest in, a future where they have to defend themselves without the US. That future does not loom in the distance. It is already here. For now, there is a political job that can be done. It is the puncturing of the image Trump has done so much to cultivate, and which he relies on to intimidate others, at home and abroad. The Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal made a good start this week, when he said: ""The president's surrender is pathetic and weak."" This is the right language to use. Trump may be the greatest showman, but he is the weakest strongman the world has ever seen.",the Guardian,2025-02-21T15:21:45.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/21/donald-trump-usa-russia-vladimir-putin-weakest-strongman
Germany can turbocharge Europe’s renewal – if it will only seize this moment,"T hree times in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, its chancellors have made strategic choices that opened the door to a better future for Europe. Today there's not just an opportunity but an urgent need for a fourth such historic moment. If the country's new coalition government under Friedrich Merz manages to seize the chance of this crisis, both Germany and Europe will go forward. If it fails, then by the end of the 2020s both may have fallen backwards farther and faster than most of us could have imagined in our worst nightmares. The big difference with those three earlier pivotal moments is this: in 1949, 1969 and 1989 the Federal Republic's policy was fundamentally aligned with that of the United States. This time, Germany has to build up a stronger, free, democratic and Ukraine-supporting Europe against the current policy of the US. The most staggering moment of Sunday's election evening was when the lifelong Atlanticist Merz declared that Europe must "" really achieve independence from the US "". (When compared with Emmanuel Macron's almost British sycophancy in the White House the next day, Germany's prospective chancellor is sounding more robustly Gaullist than the French president.) The 1949 choice of Konrad Adenauer, the Federal Republic's great founding chancellor, to integrate the western half of his divided country firmly in the emerging transatlantic geopolitical west, and into a more integrated Europe, was in tune with the post-1945, cold war orientation of the US and the new state's key European partners, France and Britain. Chancellor Willy Brandt's 1969 opening to the east, his Ostpolitik, chimed with detente policies being pursued by Washington, Paris and London. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 1989 determination to embed German unification in further steps of European unification, including a common European currency, was welcomed by the US and opened the door to French acceptance of German unity. In all three cases, there were big reservations in one or other western capital - the most shortsighted of them being Margaret Thatcher's opposition to German unification - but in the broad sweep of history, Germany's big strategic choices were aligned with those of a US-led geopolitical west. Today no more. So long as Donald Trump is in the White House, there will be no ""west"" as a single geopolitical actor. On Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we had the scandalous spectacle of the US voting with Russia against a British-European UN resolution in support of Ukraine. The US has now joined the transactional great and middle powers of the Brics in assaulting what's left of the liberal international order that America itself built. The international relations scholar John Ikenberry once described the US as a liberal leviathan . Today, the liberal leviathan has become a rogue elephant. The free Europe we have built since 1949 is therefore under attack from inside and out, and the two kinds of threat are intertwined. An anti-liberal, populist nationalist Europe is gaining ground everywhere. The chancellor candidate of the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), Alice Weidel, was not wrong, from her point of view, to describe her party's election result - one fifth of the overall vote, clear election winner in eastern Germany , second-largest party in the new Bundestag - as a ""historic success"". Shockingly, it was supported from Washington. US vice-president JD Vance's rant at the Munich security conference was in effect an election speech for the AfD. On Sunday evening, Merz caustically observed that the interventions in German democratic politics from Washington were ""no less dramatic than those from Moscow."" After Germany's unification in 1990, we celebrated the fact that Germany had become a ""normal"" European country. Now, in a sense, we must mourn it. For to be a normal European country today is to be one in which the liberal centre is drinking in the last-chance saloon. If the liberal centre doesn't make the changes that will win voters back from the populist extremes, Marine Le Pen will become French president in 2027, the AfD will win the German elections in 2029 and Nigel Farage's Reform UK will overtake the Conservatives at the ballot box. The good news is that there's growing clarity across mainstream German and European liberal democratic parties about what needs to be done. Europe has to save Ukraine. We must rapidly build a much stronger common European defence, including Britain. All of us, but especially Germany, have to restore economic dynamism, without reversing the green transition, and also address the concerns about socioeconomic and geographical inequality that have driven voters to the populists. We must control irregular migration yet make a success of the integration of large numbers of immigrants, which is the only way to address our acute demographic challenge. How to do it? How to pay for it? The obstacles inside Germany are immense. A country famous for its automobile engines is now most notable for its brakes - including a constitutionally anchored ""debt brake"" . Yet it's also true that a German chancellor has immense possibilities to steer the country in a new direction if, like Adenauer, Brandt and Kohl, they have the will and the skill to do so. Traditionally, the forthcoming coalition talks between Christian Democrats and Social Democrats would result in a set of compromises involving each party getting slices from a large and growing cake. But what if the cake is shrinking and two large new slices - more investment in defence and in the country's neglected infrastructure - must be cut out of it? Obviously Germany must somehow ease that debt brake, but if this is really to be a moment of strategic change - a true Zeitenwende - then Merz will have to follow his two great Christian Democratic predecessors, Adenauer and Kohl, and take a further big step towards a stronger Europe. For security, the defence industry, energy, the green transition and AI, Europe needs scale to hold its own in this world of bullying giants. The solutions don't always have to involve classic Brussels-type integration, but they can't just be national. The biggest German brake of all is a state of mind - a curious mix of being at once too comfortable and too fearful. As a lover of German compound nouns, I was delighted to see the German political scientist Karl-Rudolf Korte capture this brilliantly by characterising Germany as a Wolferwartungsland (a country constantly expecting the wolf to arrive). But today the wolves are actually there: two big ones at the door, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump , and one small one, the AfD, already inside the hen coop. To see off those wolves, Germans need one quality above all: courage. Let them take advice from their national poet. ""Property lost,"" wrote Goethe, ""something lost! ... Honour lost, much lost! ... Courage lost, everything lost!""",the Guardian,2025-02-26T06:00:04.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/26/germany-leadership-europe-ukraine-usa-opposition
There is a clear Trump doctrine. Those who can’t see it won't have a say in reshaping the world,"A resonant phrase during Donald Trump's first administration was the advice to take him ""seriously, but not literally"". It was a singularly detrimental expression, widely quoted by politicians and the media. Its adoption fit with the position many felt most comfortable taking: Trump was bad, but he wasn't smart. He wasn't intentional. He wasn't calculated and deliberate. He sounded off, but rarely followed up with action. He was in essence a misfiring weapon that could do serious damage, but mostly by accident. The residue of that approach still persists , even in analysis that describes Trump's first executive orders as a campaign of ""shock and awe"", as if it were just a matter of signalling rather than executing. Or that his plan for Gaza is to be taken - you guessed it - seriously, not literally . When that was suggested to Democratic senator Andy Kim, he lost it . ""I understand people are bending over backwards to try to mitigate some of the fallout from these statements that are made,"" he told Politico. But Trump is ""the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world ... if I can't take the words of the president of the United States to actually mean something, rather than needing some type of oracle to be able to explain, I just don't know what to think about when it comes to our national security."" Part of the problem is that people are reluctant to imbue Trump with any sort of coherence. But a Trump doctrine is emerging, most sharply in foreign policy. It has clear features, contours and a sort of unified theory of conflict. First, it is transactional, particularly when it comes to warfare in which the US is playing a role. Nothing has a history or any objective sense of right and wrong. Time starts with Trump, and his role is to end things, ideally while securing some bonus for the US. That upside is the second feature of the Trump doctrine: financialisation, or the reduction of politics to how much things cost, what is the return and how it can be maximised. Trump sees conflicts and financial assistance that have not produced anything tangible for the US. From the Gaza war, some sort of real estate deal can be salvaged. In Ukraine, a proposal for almost four times the value of US assistance so far in minerals is like the stripping of a distressed company by a new investment manager trying to recoup the funds disbursed by predecessors. The third feature is the junking of any notions of ""soft power"" - something that is seen as expensive, with questionable benefits that are abstract and unquantifiable. Soft power might even be a myth altogether, a fiction that flattered previously gullible regimes, giving them some sense of control while others fed off the US's resources. In Gaza or Ukraine , the US was going through the motions of action without a definitive breakthrough. Where others saw soft power, Trump sees quagmires. The features of this approach may change, and they might be shortsighted and deleterious to the US's security. And they may not entirely come from Trump himself, but rather the intersection of different political strands of the configuration of interests that support and advise him. Channelled through Trump, the doctrine takes on the hallmarks of his character - rambling, narcissistic, ignorant. However, none of this should be confused with a lack of underlying consistency and resolve to follow through. This leaves other leaders, particularly in Europe , in a place where their historical arrangements and understandings when it comes to US compact have been wiped out. European countries are now simply junior nations who can either dispense with their cancelled notions of the importance of rebuffing Vladimir Putin, join Trump in bringing an end to the war on his terms, or pick up the pieces themselves when the US withdraws its support. The ensuing anger and language of "" appeasement "" and "" capitulation "" feels like a misreading of what is happening, an echo of a time when it was universally agreed upon that aggressive enemies are to be stood up to, and anything else is a moral defeat and sign of weakness. But Trump is functioning in a different value system, one where these notions don't even apply or have different definitions. As Europeans seethe, Trump's plan for Ukraine is being worked out not only away from Europe in Washington, but in the Middle East, at new centres of middleman power that have always been transactional. They themselves are in the throes of redefining their relationship with the US, and have no illusions about the world that is emerging. Sergei Lavrov met with Marco Rubio in Riyadh and Volodymyr Zelenskyy flew to the region preparing for Gulf-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi. Those whose relationships with the US have been hard-edged, about mutual self-interest rather than shared values, and have always had to manage the US to greater or lesser extents, seem best positioned now to not freeze in moral horror. For the rest, for the country's more intimate friends and family, those who shared America's values and security liabilities, the regime change is a bitter pill to swallow. It is likely that there can be no persuasion, negotiation or hope of a ""transatlantic bridge"", as Keir Starmer has been described, a figure that can act as an intermediary between the US and Europe and head off rupture. Perhaps Starmer can appeal to Trump's ego? Or "" tread a diplomatic line "", or convince him that giving in to Putin makes him look weak ? All that assumes some measure of impulsiveness on Trump's part that can be reined in (and by a prime minister not exactly known for his pyrotechnic charm), and also that Trump even shares similar notions of ""judgment of history"" or the same understanding of ""weakness"". There is no small, but still shared, middle ground. There are now two options for the US's former close friends and security partners: shed everything, dispense with notions of European solidarity, fast-forward the end of the postwar order, and make peace with defence vulnerability and political subordination. Or embark on a colossal power-mapping exercise. This entails rapid, closely coordinated action on a political, bureaucratic and military level to either replace the US, or at least demonstrate that they constitute a bloc that has some power, agency and agility - and challenge Trump in the only language he understands. It is tempting to think that Trump doesn't mean it, or needs to be managed and cajoled because all that underlies his actions is recklessness. Or that there is a way to reconcile what are now in essence two incompatible conceptions of the global order. Who wants to wake up every day and reckon with the end of the world as they know it? But it is so. And the sooner political leaders come to terms with the fact that roads back to the old way are closed, the more likely it is that this new world will not be fashioned entirely on Trump's terms.",the Guardian,2025-02-24T06:00:06.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/24/donald-trump-doctrine-usa-reshape-the-world
It’s two years since the kids left. Here’s what I’ve learned – and what has surprised me,"I come into the kitchen to find my husband staring into space, which is normally my job. Then he points. ""It's time to accept we aren't bread-bin people,"" he says. I believe, instinctively, ancestrally, in bread bins; I come from bread-bin stock. But since we acquired ours five years ago, it has been used probably five times. On one of these occasions, a loaf was left in there for so long that the buildup of mould caused the lid to warp. I assumed the problem was living with teenagers with no object permanence, who, even if they saw the bread go in , forgot it existed once it was no longer visible. However, after two years of an empty nest, bread still lives on top of the bin. It turns out that even I am not a bread-bin person. Our younger son just turned 21, meaning we are a childless household in every official sense of the term. It is and isn't how I expected it would be. The bread bin is just one of my empty-nest surprises; here are some others. I am actually very tidy - indeed, unpleasantly uptight about tidiness. It was the eternal churn of family mess that made me a slattern. We are now a Nando's-free household after years of peri-peri tyranny, but I find myself pining for ""macho peas"" and pallid, lukewarm chips. Is it the flabby fries or the slack, companionable comfort of those four-on-the-sofa TV dinners I want? My husband suggested getting a small, elegant sofa recently, but the idea of never squashing the four of us on to ours again made me unspeakably sad. I don't want a dog. It has been 18 months since my beloved dog Oscar died . Empty nesters always get dogs, but I don't want to nurture anything more demanding than our roster of surrogate children (idiot hens, an infant tortoise and Susan, the fugitive wedding dove on our roof who arrived eight months ago, but still won't let me touch her). If we don't do a weekly food shop, nothing falls apart and no one perishes. Escaping the parenting trenches before most of my peers means I socialise a lot with older people - and, oof, their energy! Does your life force gradually replenish until you can bounce through pilates, Zumba and five-a-side, volunteer for multiple charities, learn the harpsichord and improve your Arabic? When does that start, please? Life feels blissfully easy day to day (less laundry, more leisure) and existentially confusing. I feel as tied to my sons as ever, but also cut off, teetering between overbearing interference and strenuously pretending to be casual, constantly second-guessing whether I should ask how the exam went, if they slept, whether the sun is shining where they are. Reading Nina Stibbe's latest diaries I was envious at how happily enmeshed she is in her grownup children's lives. It's cringey how much I miss them. Sometimes, I catch myself staring jealously over my husband's shoulder at a WhatsApp from one of them; I regularly check the weather where they live; when they Deliveroo on my account, I spy on their orders. It's also annoying when they come home, wilfully misunderstanding the recycling system, eating at inconvenient times and using towels like oligarchs. Just as I adjust and relax, they leave again. I thought I would work harder when they left, become a single-minded art monster. Instead, I feel fallow, like my brain used itself up producing this crop of offspring and needs a year (or five) off. It's unnerving. I read a lot about the creative power of idleness to try to reassure myself. It's no surprise to remember how much I like my husband's company, but it's astonishing to realise we only cohabited for five years before careering into 22 years of full-on family life. We are as free now as when he arrived in London in 1997 (on crutches, with his grandmother's yucca tree). Dizzyingly so: we could do anything we like. Raise ostriches! Join a cult! Move to Acapulco! But I don't want to rip everything up. I hope that is a good sign. Life feels quiet, spacious and strange; a long, slow exhale. What will the inhale bring? No idea.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T14:00:10.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/its-two-years-since-the-kids-left-heres-what-ive-learned-and-what-has-surprised-me
"The Guardian view on Britain and the US: Starmer spoke Trump’s language, but it’s deeds that matter","E urope hoped that concerted efforts could have some effect in bringing round Donald Trump to a more reasonable position on Ukraine, and mitigate the worst of his administration's instincts. After the combined persuasion and flattery of Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron brought out a somewhat tamer and more jovial version of the US president, there were modest hopes that the Ukrainian president's visit to Washington might be more productive than feared - even if there was no sign that they had succeeded in tempting Mr Trump towards the security assurances so desperately needed. Instead, his Oval Office meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon exploded into acrimony, with the US president berating his guest for ingratitude. Mr Trump had earlier spoken of partnership with the Ukrainian president. But he and his vice-president, JD Vance, teamed up to deliver a public kicking. It would, the president added, be ""great television"". ""You are gambling with world war three,"" Mr Trump accused him. He attacked Mr Zelenskyy's ""hatred"" for Vladimir Putin, suggesting it was the obstacle to achieving peace - no mention of Russia's invasion. So much for Mr Trump's remark that ""I'm in the middle, I'm for both Ukraine and Russia"" - itself a shameful pronouncement. It is hard to see how the curtailed visit - Mr Trump said that Mr Zelenskyy ""can come back when he is ready for peace"" - could have gone worse. ""President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" Mr Trump wrote. Europe's charm initiative was always a long shot. Like Mr Macron, Sir Keir enjoyed a jovial reception from Mr Trump. He had learned to speak his language. Having arrived armed with an invitation for a second state visit, he gushed that Donald Trump's return to Britain would be ""so incredible. It will be historic."" He also managed to speak the truth: he stressed that peace must not reward the aggressor and factchecked the president's lie that European aid to Ukraine was merely loaned. Asked about Mr Trump's vision for Gaza, he stated the need for Palestinians to return home and reaffirmed the UK's commitment to the two-state solution. Mr Trump, in affable mode, suggested he would probably back the UK's plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal, but its substance remains unclear - and likely skewed in America's favour. It would have been folly for Sir Keir to burn bridges. But it was always clear that Mr Trump would be ready to set the torch to them himself whenever he saw fit. And so on Friday he put the boot into a democratically elected leader fighting to defend his country against invasion - ""You don't have the cards,"" he told Mr Zelenskyy - yet has said he believes that Mr Putin can be trusted to keep promises. No one else does, which is why a security backstop from the US is needed. The minerals deal that Kyiv was set to sign with Washington smacks more of a shakedown than a partnership. Mr Trump's suggestion that American workers mining those resources could be the backstop against further Russian aggression was both a reminder of his priorities and further confirmation that he will not offer anything more substantive. Then came his blistering attack on Mr Zelenskyy. Sunday's defence summit of European leaders in London is now more crucial than ever. ""Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,"" wrote the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, following the disastrous meeting. The extent of their erstwhile ally's betrayal is now undeniable. Kyiv is the first but not the only victim. The extent to which European countries are able to formulate a plan for acting accordingly, and in unison, will be critical to Ukraine's future, and to the continent's.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T18:59:06.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-zelenskyy-in-washington-trump-turns-his-fire-on-the-beleaguered-president
"The AfD are circling like vultures. But in Berlin, I found a new, young left rising against them","W ill democracy still prevail in the west in a decade? It was certainly a question weighing on the minds of the hundreds of Die Linke supporters crammed into a former film studio overlooking Berlin's Tempelhof airport last weekend. They were gathered to listen to the results of Germany's election - and their reactions were mixed. The far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) had just doubled its support in federal elections, securing a fifth of the vote, yet Die Linke came top in the capital, albeit with 21% of the vote. They cheered, hugged, kissed and cried. We were in Neukolln, a diverse neighbourhood of south-eastern Berlin, and the triumphant candidate was Ferat Kocak , a charismatic Kurdish-German leftist. His grassroots campaign knocked on every door in the district - not unusual in the UK and US, but a novelty in Germany. ""For several years, the left has been in a kind of shocked paralysis about what to do with the rising right,"" explained 30-year-old activist Isabelle: grassroots campaigning, she believes, brought the left out of its bubble. A few months ago, Die Linke seemed sunk, its former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht splitting away to forge a new alliance blending leftwing economics with social conservatism. But the alliance failed to win seats. ""Young people are more attracted to connecting leftwing economics with antiracism and feminism, and not putting them against each other,"" said fellow activist Johanna. Die Linke's support was once concentrated in a generation that grew up in the former East Germany, battered by deindustrialisation and nostalgia - ostalgie - for the security of Stalinism. But as that generation drifted to the far right, the West German youth shifted leftwards . The party also prospered with women, with more than a third voting for them. A quarter of men opted for the far right. Even though Kocak stormed to victory in Neukolln with 30%, his mood is sombre. ""Dark times are upon us,"" he tells me in a cramped room away from the crowd, pointing to how ""everyone was talking about deportation and migration"". When I ask why the AfD has suddenly surged, his answer is clear: ""They're gaining strength in a social environment where people can no longer afford to live."" When he knocked on doors, one woman pointed to her single shopping bag. It cost EUR50, she said: that would once have filled two bags. Germany was once Europe's powerhouse , benefiting from a euro that made its exports to eurozone countries much cheaper than the old deutschmark. In the past three years, inflation as a result of the energy shock produced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has hit people's pockets. More than half of Germans say they worry about increasing prices meaning they can't pay bills, rising to 75% of AfD supporters . There are long-term issues, too. ""In the last 20 years, neither the state nor private sector did enough investment,"" Carolina Ortega Guttack, an economist at the thinktank FiscalFuture, tells me. A "" debt brake "" - introduced in 2009 by the then chancellor, Angela Merkel, to commit to limit borrowing - helped deter investment. In real terms, the German economy is smaller than it was five years ago . Germany brims with discontent: 83% of Germans say the economic situation is bad - compared with 39% in 2022 - rising to 96% with AfD voters. Without migrants filling vacancies left by an ageing population, its economy would probably be worse, but, encouraged by the AfD, politicians of different flavours have willingly made them scapegoats. Under Merkel, the centre-right CDU brought in more than 1 million refugees: but it has since swerved rightwards on migration. A few weeks ago, the CDU - now set to lead the government - passed a parliamentary motion clamping down on asylum seekers with the support of the AfD, violating the ""firewall"" against the far right that has persisted since the second world war. Helena Marschall, a young activist who helped organise protests against the firewall desecration, said all parties played with fire. ""My deportation plans are better than your deportation plans"" is how she sums up the mainstream parties' campaigns. Across Europe , these parties attempted to defuse far-right surges by raiding their rhetoric and policies, only succeeding in legitimising them. Here's the fear. The AfD co-leader Alice Weidel sees Hungary's far-right Viktor Orban as a "" great role model "". Orban has gradually dismantled democracy by rigging the game against opponents in politics and media. It is a playbook comparable to Vladimir Putin's strategy in Russia, a repressive autocracy that still allows opposition parties for appearance's sake. Across the west, economic discontent fused with anti-migrant scapegoating has driven a far-right insurgency. In power, all are likely to adopt this strategy: see how Donald Trump and Elon Musk are wearing down US democracy by attrition. Germany's past, you would think, may help immunise the country from this threat: but the stigma of that nightmare has diminished with time. ""I think our collective memory is very short,"" warned Jamil, a 31-year-old Syrian-German citizen who fled Bashar al-Assad's regime and came to Germany in 2015 as a refugee. Then, he and his fellow arrivals were welcomed at train stations by volunteers giving out food and donations. The mood has since darkened, and with a new grand coalition of centre-right and centre-left set to assume office, the AfD are circling like vultures, waiting to feast on the disillusionment to come.",the Guardian,2025-03-03T06:00:30.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/afd-berlin-new-young-left-election-germany-die-linke
"Salman Rushdie out, Dan Brown in: why it’s time to detoxify our middle-class bookshelves","T oughen up. It's the end of the line for soft, middle-class authors. Lefty-baiting headteacher Katharine Birbalsingh has declared that "" gentle parenting "" advice books by middle-class writers are sabotaging families by insisting adults become friends with their children. She's probably got a point - most mums and dads have watched with a cocked eyebrow as a Boden-clad parent has tranquilly informed little Johnny that punching another child in the face while playing in the sandpit ""might not be what they like"" - but I say Birbalsingh is not going far enough. Why stop with the parenting books? Why not fillet the whole damn bookcase of toxically middle-class ideas? Visionaries such as Chairman Mao have tried it before - with, admittedly, mixed results - but this time we'll do it right. Let's face it, the bookshelf in every Victorian terrace house with a side return extension isn't there to be read, it's there to be seen. Your copy of Yuval Noah Harari 's Sapiens has been avidly absorbed right up to the second chapter; the Jilly Cooper hidden in your bedside cabinet, on the other hand, is so well used that some of those pages have been torn to shreds. Why the disparity? Crippling middle-class literary competitiveness. It's hard to say why books ever became objects of show, rather than functional items, though we can probably blame the monks who spent their years copying out and beautifying volumes for nothing more than the aggrandisement of their order and the prospect of centuries-later inclusion in Umberto Eco mysteries. The Reformation thankfully put paid to that game. So now a domestic Reformation may be called for. How best to clean up that toxically middling bookcase? First off, there's the low-hanging fruit. Any textbook on parenting that sports a soft-focus cover image of a child happily walking hand in hand with a grownup, written by anyone with a double-barrelled surname, is straight into the recycling bin. Ditto for anything recommended by an ethereally calm Instagram influencer or a member of the Green party. Burn before reading. Protect yourself. Protect your family. After that, we're on to the fiction. The golden rule is: nothing in translation. If it was written by anyone who lives more than 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, it's out. Keep in mind, too, that anything described as ""vital"" or ""necessary"" by a newspaper critic is to be viewed with the deepest suspicion. No book is ""vital"" or ""necessary"". Not one. After disposing of the wrong'uns, you'll want to replace them with the sort of book that Nigel Farage likes to read: Scouting for Boys , The Dangerous Book for Boys , The Boy's Own Annual 1948 . Something about a loyal dog, perhaps. If you're looking for a literary classic, Nicholas Nickleby is a solid choice in the family home, due to a depiction of Victorian schooling that will scare the bejeezus out of any child; hopefully terrifying them into doing something at school other than vaping and recording violent drill rap TikToks. Immerse your offspring in these reliable works and they'll thank you one day. At the very least, if you make these changes there will no longer be any danger of being ""friends"" with children; and anyone who has heard the drivel they come out with will appreciate the value of this. Reading, like the curious American phenomenon the spelling bee, has too often become divorced from its primary literary function and turned into a method of social place-staking: leave boxing to the working class, polo to the aristocrats, the middling folk have novels by Salman Rushdie to be paraded in conversation. It's time we thought about how to reset that. after newsletter promotion Perhaps the answer is to make reading a private affair like it used to be. Instead of displaying your books like Ernest Hemingway showing off the head of some rhino he's blasted to kingdom come, shut them away to be enjoyed privately, perhaps by candlelight. Then we can drop all the pretence. If you like a felon-bashing Jack Reacher story, fill yer boots and be proud of it. If you secretly want to binge the latest Dan Brown romp, then why not? Anyone judging you for doing so is really only jealous. Just think how much more space you will have on your bookshelf for The Da Vinci Code or Jack Reacher: Killing Floor when you've ditched Sally Rooney's latest navel-gazing drear. Once the novels are gone, keep checking along the shelf and decide what you actually look through. All those Yotam Ottolenghi cookbooks that leave you searching for herbs hand-plucked from the slopes of the Judaean mountains, when the children would be happier with chicken nuggets, can go; and the same for all those biographies of Nelson Mandela that sound really interesting but have never been opened. If you don't use or read them, they're ballast to be dropped. Once we stop treating books as relics for show and veneration, we can also stop treating their authors as prophets. Like football players commenting on international relations, the fact that someone has been handed a megaphone really doesn't mean they have the first clue what they're shouting about. Yet, social mores seem to weigh on middle-class parents to largely outsource the raising of their young to books. This is despite that fact that doing so devolves all moral instruction to Peppa Pig. We can end on positive news, though: it was revealed last week that many children have stopped reading almost entirely and now prefer to have the words spoon-fed to them by audiobook. That will make it easier to conceal from your finger-wagging middle-class peers the fact that they like Enid Blyton books.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T17:30:44.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/salman-rushdie-out-dan-brown-in-detoxify-middle-class-bookshelves-books
"In this dangerous age, Britain needs to exert soft power as well as the hard stuff","S hortly before he flew to Washington, Sir Keir Starmer turned up in the Commons, put on his sombre voice and declared: "" Everything has changed ."" One of the more startling transformations has been to Sir Keir himself. The Labour leader came to office thinking, as did most of those who voted for him, that he was going to be a domestically orientated prime minister with primary ambitions to improve living standards, build lots of homes and rejuvenate public services. That's what ""change"", his one-word election slogan, was supposed to be about. When he originally selected his overriding "" five missions "", the defence of the realm didn't make the cut. His central definition today is as a geopolitically focused prime minister who is promising to spend more on guns, missiles and warplanes and less on international aid. More British bullets will be purchased at the expense of succour to the impoverished and desperate of the world. This shift gives a flintier profile to his leadership, but not in a way that either supporters or opponents anticipated during last summer's election. Most Labour people don't quarrel with the argument that Britain has to put up its guard, but a lot of them, including queasy members of the Starmer cabinet , are wriggling uncomfortably about taking the hatchet to the international development budget. In the days since the decision was announced, they have taken to wondering what manner of Labour government is this? The short explanation for this transmogrification is two words and an initial: Donald J Trump. The upheaval in the international order unleashed by the US president has shattered decades-old assumptions about the western alliance. This has had a more profound impact on Sir Keir than any other event. A prime minister who used to earn his living as a human rights lawyer has had a crash course in realpolitik from the nakedly transactional practitioner of great power games who resides on Pennsylvania Avenue. Sir Keir came away from his encounter at the White House on Thursday empty-handed when it came to securing a bankable guarantee that there will be US military cover for any British and French peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine. What the prime minister did win was an apparent blessing for the Chagos Islands deal, puncturing Nigel Farage's repeated claims that the White House is opposed to it. There were encouraging noises that the UK may swerve US tariffs and pats on the head for Sir Keir from his host for being a ""special man"" and a ""very tough negotiator"". The price was paid in the currency of ingratiation. This was at its most toe-curling when the prime minister delved into his jacket pocket to flourish an invite from the king for the US president to make an ""unprecedented"", ""truly historic"" second state visit to the UK. Excuse me while I find something to retch into. The other tribute to the Maga King was setting a 2027 deadline for lifting British defence spending to 2.5% of GDP with 3% as the ultimate target. Boosting defence spending is both a response to Trump's demands that Europe pulls its weight and an insurance policy against the withdrawal of American security guarantees. Downing Street reeled at the callous and chilling monstering of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a democratically elected leader fighting for his country's freedom against tyranny, at the White House on Friday. The shocking ugliness of the televised scene amplified Number 10's unspoken fears that the Trump regime poses an existential challenge to European security. I've been among those anticipating this pivot . Given how menacing the world looked even before Trump's return to the Oval Office, it was not sustainable to leave Britain's armed forces in such a parlous condition that our own defence secretary describes them as "" hollowed out "". The intelligence chiefs and the top brass have become increasingly clamourous about the growing scale and intensity of threats from a spectrum of malevolent adversaries. The issue then becomes whether the money will be spent well or wastefully. The Ministry of Defence has a rotten record when it comes to equipping the armed forces in a timely and cost-effective way. The onus is now on John Healey and the service chiefs to prove that they can get the maximum bang from the taxpayers' extra bucks. The pain inflicted on the international aid budget will be brutal. Sir Keir was all crocodile tears when he intoned that regrettably "" hard choices "" had to be made, as if more money for defence could only be found by stealing it from aid programmes. There were many other options for a government that spends in excess of PS1tn a year. These included being less generous towards other demands for spending, bearing down on escalating costs in areas of welfare or raising more from taxation. Though the prime minister claims he did not take this decision ""lightly"", the international development budget was targeted because Downing Street and the Treasury reckoned it was the politically least painful option. This is the superficially clever and unashamedly cynical choice when it comes to electoral calculations. Polling suggests that cutting aid is a popular option with around two-thirds of voters. There's an assumption among Labour strategists that aid is particularly resented by the kind of voter who supported Labour at the election and is now flirting with Reform or has already switched to it. There's some truth in this analysis, but it is not the whole truth. There's danger for Labour among the significant wedge of voters who chose the party at the election partly on the basis that it was more compassionate, enlightened and internationalist than the Tories. They didn't expect Labour to outdo the last Conservative government in slashing the development budget. The case for spending on aid is easily made. On top of the humanitarian good it does, there's the mitigation against instability, conflict and extremism. It also helps win friends and influence people in other countries who can be useful to the UK in the projection and protection of our national interests. These arguments will be highly familiar to Sir Keir and his cabinet because it was precisely the case they used to make themselves when they berated the Conservatives for raiding the budget. As Labour's election manifesto put it, international aid helps make ""the world a safer, more prosperous place"". The UK used to be able to make the claim that its record on helping the poorer parts of the planet made us a soft power superpower. As recently as 2020, the UK was one of only seven wealthy countries that met the UN target to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. The Conservatives cut that to 0.5% under Boris Johnson and it will now be slashed down to just 0.3%. Since a hefty chunk of the budget is being spent on asylum-seekers within Britain, the net amount supporting international development will be even more miserly. Programmes threatened include those alleviating poverty , tackling disease, improving the education of young people and addressing the climate crisis. after newsletter promotion This was a humiliation for Annaliese Dodds who was presented with a fait accompli just 24 hours before the cuts were announced. Number 10 clearly reckoned there was a slight risk that she would resign as international development minister, or decided it wasn't terribly bothered even if she did. She has quit with the warning that denuding the international development budget will only encourage Russia's aggressive effort to increase its presence worldwide. Blood must be rushing to the head of David Lammy. Justifying the cut has obliged the foreign secretary to stand on his head. It is only very recently that he was wagging a finger at the Americans by telling them it was a ""big strategic mistake"" to let Elon Musk eviscerate the US development budget. He accompanied that with the warning that China would exploit the vacuum to further its influence. I am being generous when I say that it is disingenuous of Sir Keir and his loyalists to suggest that they were faced with an either/or choice between defence spending in the name of national security and non-defence spending in troubled and distressed places abroad. The UK is an affluent country that likes to think it can punch above its weight. Even when money is tight, this nation is wealthy enough to wield both hard power and soft power. The face of Britain that the Starmer government is now presenting to the world is one that aspires to be more muscular while also looking meaner. Muscular is necessary in the scary new world order. Meaner is a myopic mistake that will render Britain less safe.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T07:30:01.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/britain-soft-power-ukraine-trump-zelenskyy
"As the far right surges around the globe, what can a new TV series about Mussolini teach us?","O n 3 January 1925, Benito Mussolini delivered the most important speech of his life to the Italian parliament. His career was about to be over. The body of the socialist deputy and his bitter foe, Giacomo Matteotti , had been discovered in a shallow grave near Rome and mounting evidence pointed to Mussolini's responsibility for his murder. With the king, the old liberal democratic elite, the left and many of his own party pressing for his dismissal, Mussolini declared that everything - the fascist violence, the immorality, the turmoil into which Italy had sunk - was his fault, ""because I, I alone, created it"". By the same token, he alone was the man ""capable of dominating the crisis"". Parliament, stunned, sat silent. There was no voice of protest. The dictatorship was saved. Based on the first volume in a trilogy of the same name by Antonio Scurati and garlanded with praise by Italian critics, the television drama Mussolini: Son of the Century covers just six years in Mussolini's life, from his days as a brawling but highly effective journalist in Milan to his assumption of total power. Joe Wright, better known for his gentle approach and light touch in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, has produced a series that is loud, provocative and violent. The music that accompanies it is throbbing, incessant and often intrusive, with occasional snatches of Verdi and Puccini. All is dark, deeply gloomy and sepia-coloured. The series is presented as a ""biographical historical drama"" - that is to say, with considerable licence to play about with the facts. It would be fair, however, to say that for the most part the narrative keeps close to the broad sweep of Mussolini's rise. The gerarchi, the fascist leaders such as the flying ace Italo Balbo and the gross and vituperative Roberto Farinacci from Cremona, are portrayed in their greedy, strident, vulgar colours; and his mistress, the art critic Margherita Sarfatti , is rightly seen as a considerable influence on fascism's emerging ideology. Rachele, Mussolini's long-suffering wife, is relegated to the shadows, and Bianca Ceccato, mother of one of his illegitimate children, is made to stand for the many others he impregnated. But the details niggle. It is highly unlikely that Quinto Navarra, Mussolini's valet, saw Matteotti's bloodstained wallet in the drawer of his employer's desk. The blackshirts never staged a vast, orderly rally along the Appian Way and Mussolini surely never flung himself backwards into the arms of his yelling, flame-throwing followers. Cesare Rossi, the regime's press and propaganda man, is shown here as the Duce's main confidant - when that role was in fact occupied by his brother, Arnaldo. Does this matter? Luca Marinelli gives a convincing performance as the narcissistic, bombastic, insecure Mussolini who, when not addressing Rossi or a vast bust of himself in the Palazzo Venezia, speaks directly to the camera, to us, his audience. There are very few scenes in which he is not present, filmed a little from below, glowering over us, confiding his thoughts, his triumphs, his contempt for his companions. This is fascism as theatre, hectoring and loud. More important than the details, perhaps, is the lack of subtlety, the crude juxtaposition between the sanity represented by Matteotti and the noisy, inarticulate barbarity offered by the fascists. There are few moments of respite. This series is not for the faint-hearted. Many people were indeed bludgeoned, dosed with castor oil and killed by the fascists, but not on this vast, orgiastic scale. The March on Rome was, in fact, concluded not in widespread bloodshed, as the series suggests, but remarkably peacefully. In Milan, Turin and Parma, where opposition was expected, the fascists took control quietly and smoothly. Rome, on the day the king lost his nerve and offered Mussolini the prime ministership, has been described as being in a ""fever of delight"" and florists ran out of flowers. Some of the more interesting wider perspectives have been lost. Mussolini won friends abroad: by 1923, Sir Ronald Graham, British ambassador to Rome, was reporting to London that Mussolini was a ""statesman of exceptional ability and expertise"". And you get little sense of Italy itself in the early 1920s, a country that felt betrayed by the allies, but was full of clever, articulate people, such as the historian Gaetano Salvemini and the philosopher Benedetto Croce, highly intelligent anti-fascists who, like Matteotti, fought hard to save the country from the dictatorship. The miniseries aired in Italy before the UK release, and has attracted a great number of viewers, many of them admiring. In contemporary Italy, Mussolini is never far away. At the end of the war, the allies planned to rid the country of all visible signs of the dictatorship. They discovered that Mussolini had successfully imprinted fascist ideology on to the landscape, stamping his mark on to houses, sports stadiums and entire towns. Predappio in Emilia-Romagna, where he grew up, remains a place of pilgrimage for Italians who descend on the anniversary of the March on Rome, to raise their arm in the fascist salute and buy replicas of the Duce's various helmets and berets. On Lake Garda, where he had his last government, the villas in which he and his mistress Clara ""Claretta"" Petacci lived are now five-star hotels. The rooms that bear their names are booked out years in advance. Books about him, his family and the fascist leadership never stop appearing. Mussolinismo, as the cult is known in Italy, is not illegal. Not surprising, then, that when Giorgia Meloni , a former member of the neofascist MSI, was made prime minister, there was much talk of Mussolini's legacy. It would be hard to watch the series today without being conscious of the warning it contains. When Mussolini boasts that his plan is to ""make Italy great again"", his words resonate.

"A raid and a secret tape exposed a Sicilian mafia that is shrunken, whiny and clinging on for survival","P alermo has not seen anything like it for years . Helicopters in the pre-dawn sky. Carabinieri barracks across Sicily emptied, with all 1,200 officers deployed. The Cacciatori - red-bereted shock cops - brought over from the wilds of Calabria. The Carabinieri 's own film units serving up a morning montage of flashing blue lights, balaclava-wearing officers with submachine guns, police dogs sniffing, cottage doors breaking, and burly, handcuffed men ushered into Alfa Romeos. And then, of course, in the press, the humiliating wiretaps of gangsters sharing their secrets. Cosa Nostra is back in the headlines, and back under the cosh. Italian law enforcement is good at this stuff. Not a single one of the 181 men and women targeted for arrest on 11 February managed to go on the lam before the crackdown. Based on the numbers alone, this raid was the biggest anti-mafia operation since the 1980s. But Sicily was a very different place back then. It teetered on the brink of becoming a narco-state, and Cosa Nostra treated the Italian institutions with contempt, murdering any prosecutor, police officer or politician who got in its way. A heroic minority led the fightback. Its figurehead was, of course, judge Giovanni Falcone . His enormous ""maxi trial"" of mafiosi in Palermo in 1986-87 demonstrated for the first time that the rule of law applied to the bosses too. After the supreme court confirmed the verdicts in 1992, the ferocious super-boss Salvatore ""Shorty"" Riina had Falcone and his close colleague Paolo Borsellino killed in bomb attacks. It was a national emergency, Riina's declaration of war on the state. But, in the same instant, it was a spectacular confirmation that Falcone had won a history-making victory. For the last year of his life, the martyred hero had been in Rome redesigning the way Italy fights mafia crime, based on the lessons learned in Palermo. Specialised teams of anti-mafia prosecutors in every city. Highly trained police units. A vast database of ""men of honour"" and their known associates. A new prison regime designed to prevent bosses communicating with their soldiers. Since then, Falcone's heirs have ground Cosa Nostra down. In this year's raid, it was older bosses, released from long stretches inside , who were taking the lead in trying to rebuild the mafia's structure. The bugging transcripts published in the aftermath make for a sullen collective portrait. The old bosses complain all the time. About the confiscation of their assets. About the collapse of omerta. About the quality of their recruits: ""The level's low these days. As soon as they arrest a guy, he turns penitent."" But these problems are not new: they are integral to life in today's Cosa Nostra. Exactly the same complaints surfaced during the last big round-up, in December 2008, when the Palermo mafia's entire leadership was arrested. Indeed, if anything, things have got even worse for Cosa Nostra since then. When it comes to narcotics, the Sicilian mafia is living off crumbs from the table of the 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate , the noisy neighbours from Calabria - crumbs served with seasoning of nostalgia: You've got to get by on a slab of hash? Is that how far we've fallen? The guys from the old days, the ones who've tragically been sent to prison for life, would they be talking about a slab of hash? If they talked about hash, it was because a shipload was due in ... We're down in the dirt lads. We think we're doing business, but it's others who are really at it. Cosa Nostra looks more and more toothless and friendless. During this new wave of arrests, there was not a single murder on the charge sheets, and not a single politician called to account. (At least so far.) As after 2008, the Palermo underworld now faces a rebuild. But this time it is from an even lower base. Given such a record of law-enforcement success, the curious thing for outside observers is that the pessimism in mafia circles is not matched by optimism in Sicilian society. A good part of the blame lies with one trial that, for 15 long years after 2008, hoovered up what little attention Italy could devote to mafia issues. Called the state-mafia negotiation trial, it centred on a conspiracy theory so abstruse that a baffled foreign media ignored it. Yet it set judges at each other's throats, and divided the anti-mafia movement into fanatical camps. In essence, the prosecution argued that the murders of Falcone and Borsellino were part of an unspeakable pact that bound Cosa Nostra to politicians and deep-state actors such as secret agents and Freemasons. In the end, so the prosecution claimed, the pact brought Silvio Berlusconi to power in 1994, and left the mafia free to resume its ancient partnership with the powers that be. It took until 2023 for the supreme court to demolish this nonsense. But by then, beliefs were so entrenched that many are still convinced there was a cover-up. All kinds of things fed into this collective delirium. The grief of the victims' families. The failure of the Sicilian economy to provide an anti-mafia dividend. One of Italy's worst outbreaks of anti-politics. The precocious arrival of social media populism, in the form of comedian Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement. And demoralising scandals in the anti-mafia movement, including the body responsible for administering confiscated mob properties. So this month's 181 arrests represent a return to Earth after these flights of conspiratorial fancy. The operation's mastermind, the chief prosecutor of Palermo, Maurizio De Lucia, is a noted sceptic about the state-mafia negotiation trial who is also professionally cautious about the future. Palermo's struggling businesses can still benefit from engaging Cosa Nostra's services: cheap credit and debt recovery, for example. The dilapidated prison system has become porous again: scandalously, imprisoned bosses smuggled in encrypted smartphones and held video summits with their peers on the outside. That is why, for all their complaining, the old bosses can still tempt youngsters in the godforsaken outer quarters of the city with a strong collective identity . ""Inside us we've got our ideals, and we'll never let them die because we'd die for them,"" one misty-eyed mafioso explained. Another put it more picturesquely: ""Cosa Nostra? You married this wife and you keep her as long as you live."" Armed with such resilience, mafiosi know they only have to be stronger than the weakest parts of the Italian system to hang on, and hope for better times.",the Guardian,2025-02-22T08:00:01.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/sicilian-mafia-raid-secret-tape-clinging-survival-cosa-nostra
"It’s Elon Musk’s ‘pronatalist’ bonanza – so many families, so little time","I f only Elon Musk could impregnate humans at the same rate he's giving them the ick. Alas, polls show the efficiency tsar's US approval rating dwindling towards levels he has enjoyed for quite some time among the UK public . And as a country that lived through the Boris Johnson era, I think we have to warn the Americans that if a government figure can't or won't answer the basic question ""how many kids do you have?"", then he's probably going to turn out to be a disappointment. And it might even have been a warning sign. If the WhatsApp group of his exes is bigger than Mumsnet and 10 times as pissed off, then it's just possible you could be dealing with a guy you're going to end up feeling betrayed by. Is Musk that guy? Who among us can say, certainly considering the sheer number and ferocity of the lawyers Mister Free Speech employs? I do know Elon is something called a "" pronatalist "", but I increasingly wonder whether that's just a fancy new word for a very old form of shittiness. Consider the spectacle of his ex, Grimes, coming on to the social media platform Musk owns and outright begging him to get in touch for his input concerning a "" medical crisis "" for one of their shared children. ""I'm not giving any details but he won't respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer lifelong impairment if he doesn't respond asap, so I need him to fucking respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that's where we are at."" These posts were either deleted or are now inaccessible, while one user suggested she had been ""shadowbanned"". Silly Grimes. If she had put a rape threat or some antisemitism in her APB, it would have stayed up. Or as Ashley St Clair, mother of Elon's (maybe) most recent child put it in an (also now deleted) X post last week : ""Elon, we have been trying to communicate for the past several days and you have not responded. When are you going to reply to us instead of publicly responding to smears from an individual who just posted photos of me in underwear at 15 years old?"" Aha. Think I'm starting to get a handle on ""pronatalism"". Gotta admit, I'd had my suspicions, ever since Elon portentously announced : ""Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy, we should teach fear of childlessness."" You'll notice that either way, the situation involves fear for women. Fear of taking on the responsibility when you aren't ready. Fear of not populating the Earth. Fear that when you really need him to engage with the boring/terrifying realities of parenthood, he's going to be dicking around on a conservative conference stage with a chainsaw. Literally shouting: "" CHAINSAW! "" Because that, regrettably, was where Elon could be found, wearing sunglasses indoors, at around the time the Grimes message was sent. The power tool had been handed to our power tool by the Argentinian president - the one who looks like some mid-2000s Kasabian manager who can't even get the girls that the band don't want, and once soiled himself at 6am in someone else's room at the Groucho. Anyway, it's unclear which of Grimes's children with Musk has the alleged urgent medical issue. She reportedly has three, including X AE A-Xii (X). You'll recognise X (which Grimes is far from thrilled about). He's the one Musk took to hang out with reporters and Donald Trump in the Oval Office, and I'd assumed he was the one currently being tried out for the successor role. Kind of a Musk Jong-un. Although in many ways, Kim Ju-ae, the North Korean leader's daughter and current apparent favourite could be little X's closest thing to a peer group. Their dads both root hard for Russia, and both kids have to watch a lot of rocket launches. As for the wider impact of these increasingly icky glimpses into Musk's private world, it is beginning to feel like the Doge boss has flicked the public's ""weirdo"" switch. None of us wishes to call this too soon, but it does seem as though the world likes Elon less the more they see of him. Given his lack of conventional charm, he is one of those who should have realised silence would be the most intriguing and awe-inspiring statement of all. Instead ... CHAINSAW! Meanwhile, St Clair is now pushing for sole custody of the baby alleged to be his. Motherhood can be quite crystallising, of course. Before it happens, you've got a load of free and easy ideas, you want to have a guy's "" rocket babies "". And then you do, and you send him a photo of you and your shared newborn in the delivery room, and he texts back a clipped, ""All well?"" Oof. Other messages she alleges are from Musk (and which are included in her court filings ) explain he can't visit her and the child because: ""I'm #2 after Trump for assassination ... This is not the time for sentiment at the expense of safety ... Only the paranoid survive."" Mm. Perhaps I must adopt this as my excuse to get out of any parenting I don't want to do this year. ""Guys, I'm so sorry, someone else is going to have to care about your jabs and your dentist and your, like, entire LIFE, because only the paranoid survive. I pay for it, don't I? Then what's the difference?"" There is a difference though, isn't there? I would love to believe this guy is going to be able to effect some era-defining revolution in governance that makes people have better lives. But a lot of stuff begins at home - and if Musk doesn't chainsaw the US's way to playing happy families, we might just have to accept that there were one or two red flags on the home front.",the Guardian,2025-02-25T13:53:34.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/elon-musk-pronatalism-mothers-social-media-parenting
"In Pontypool, I saw the looming threat of Nigel Farage – and how Labour is playing into his hands","T he south Welsh town of Pontypool doesn't quite suggest a crucial political frontline. The town centre is full of imposing 19th- and 20th-century buildings that were created in a spirit of pride and optimism but have long since lain empty; local people talk about the shadow of the old iron and coal industries, and the fact that precious little ever came along to take their place. On the Monday afternoon I visited, to record the Guardian's Politics Weekly podcast , the most forlorn sight was a huge mural of a local rugby crowd, lovingly sprayed on the exterior of a former discount store: a two-dimensional throng , put there to ""inspire people to remember what Pontypool could be like as a thriving community"". Despite appearances, a significant watershed moment happened here recently. Like so much of south Wales, Pontypool has long been seen as a loyal Labour redoubt - but on 13 February, Reform UK gained its first Welsh councillor in a byelection for the local borough council . The victor was a former army major who won 457 votes to Labour's anaemic 259, and claimed, when greeting his win, that there would now be no Labour councillors, MPs or members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, who could confidently think they represented safe seats. Reform UK is set on banishing the lingering idea of south Wales as a staunch socialist heartland: Nigel Farage intends to make the 2026 devolved Welsh elections ""by far our biggest priority"". In London, meanwhile, the mounting threat from Farage and his comrades and Donald Trump's return to the White House have triggered a striking political shift, led by Keir Starmer's chief of staff and supposed strategic super-brain Morgan McSweeney. The government's stance on immigration has turned sour and punitive: witness those awful videos of illegal migrants being deported, and the Kafkaesque new move to permanently deny UK citizenship to anyone who travelled here via a supposedly illegal and dangerous route. Amid support for a third Heathrow runway and talk of new drilling in the North Sea, the greenery that was once held up to be Starmer's core idea is withering away. Cuts of up to PS5bn in sickness and disability benefits loom. This was the grim context for Starmer's announcements of drastic reductions in foreign aid to open the way to an increase in defence spending. While charities and NGOs expressed alarm at what the move would mean for everything from violence against women and girls to the impacts of a heating planet, he said that making the decision had been "" extremely difficult and painful "", but it was a choice that snugly fitted the reinvention project known in some circles as Starmer's ""Reformation "" (think about it). Such a move, after all, has long been demanded by the rightwing press. Most damningly of all, it is of a piece with Donald Trump and Elon Musk's summary shut-down of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), and all the chaos it has spawned (in her resignation letter last week, the outgoing international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, pointedly said that the cut was ""already being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAid."") A lot of the government's surrounding mood music fits the same picture. One of McSweeney's sources of continuing inspiration is the Blue Labour peer Maurice Glasman: the only Labour parliamentarian invited to Trump's inauguration, and a recent guest on the podcast hosted by the former Trump insider Steve Bannon, the man who recently denied that he had enlivened his speech at the CPAC convention in Washington DC with one of those Hitler salutes . Glasman level-headedly assured his host that ""progressives"" are his political enemy, ""because they actually despise faith, they despise family, they despise love, and they don't even want you to enjoy sexual intercourse with your wife"". He also reckons that ""the only place to build a house now is on the left side of Maga Square"", wherever that is. Among the other intellectual freewheelers who have recently been talking to senior Starmer aides is Munira Mirza, the former adviser to Boris Johnson, who is said to be helping with ""a sort of critique of liberal multiculturalism"". While such conversations happen behind the scenes, other signs of the leadership's new faux-populist mindset are out in the open. Josh Simons is a newly elected Labour MP and trusted ally of McSweeney who I have heard being tipped for quick promotion to the cabinet. During the second parliamentary reading of the government's border security, asylum and immigration bill, he gave a quite remarkable speech based on his admiration for the ancient Greeks - and specifically their categorisation of migrants as ""metics"". Such people, he told the Commons, ""were subject to different rules; who joined the city was controlled and the bar was set high for who could become a citizen and vote"". If metics broke Athenian laws, moreover, ""they were expelled from the city, and sometimes thrust into the blazing Greek sun."" Lest anyone think he was getting a bit carried away, this was merely an object lesson in the principle whereby ""people who govern themselves control who they are and who becomes a member of the demos"". He had been elected by his constituents in Greater Manchester on the basis that he would not rest ""until we gripped our borders, restored control, and ... brought down the number of legal migrants entering this country each year - and I meant it"". And he finished with a pithy authoritarian flourish: ""We in the Labour party believe in control and order. The opposition do not."" With or without the classical references, will this kind of talk pull back the people Labour fears it is losing? In Pontypool, it wasn't hard to find people who were very taken with Farage and his party. One man told me that Farage ""gets on with Trump, and we've got to stay on their side"". Another said that successive governments had ""let too many people across the border ... It just seems to me that they're eating up all the work and taking everything."" What everyone said was woven through with an equally familiar theme: the constant grind of rising food bills and energy prices, and life in a place that had turned into a ""ghost town"". There are two possible approaches to all that. In keeping with their support for Ukraine, the PM and his colleagues are now set on attacking Reform UK over its soft stances on Russia , but there is a queasy contradiction at work: in other areas of policy, the Starmer/McSweeney Reformation looks set to deepen. That will not just bend centre-left politics into impossible shapes, but comes with a profound danger: that it is already making Farage and his ilk sound not just as if they control a huge chunk of the national conversation, but are preferable to whatever semi-skimmed version of populist politics Labour comes up with. Worse still, it is sure to alienate voters who may prefer the Greens, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, or the Lib Dems: over the weekend, the UCL Policy Lab published polling showing that over 40% of 2024 Labour supporters say that if safe routes for refugees were prevented or climate action slowed down, it would stop them voting Labour next time. Or there might be a plan B. Labour politicians might try their best to rebuild towns such as Pontypool, answer their call for esteem and security, and help them acquire the things whose scarcity informs all those conversations about outsiders: jobs and homes, chiefly, along with the sense that they are no less valued than people who live in more affluent places. They could do that while holding on to what is left of the party's liberal values, and finally coming up with a convincing response to an increasingly urgent question. If the world is being wrecked by bigoted, climate-denying authoritarians, is leaning into their politics really any kind of answer?",the Guardian,2025-03-02T16:28:09.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/pontypool-nigel-farage-reform-uk-labour-keir-starmer-rightwing-populism
Do Trump and co want a world reclaimed by straight white men? It’s not certain they’ll get it,"F or people who believe that the world should be run by straight white men, these are heady times. Probably the most powerful social conservative on the planet occupies the White House again, and seems determined to drive ""immoral"" and ""discriminatory"" diversity policies out of American life. Two years ago, the US supreme court banned the use of affirmative action in university admissions. A growing list of American and British companies, from Ford to BT to Goldman Sachs , appear to be reducing their commitment to the once fashionable corporate principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Meanwhile, Reform UK promises to ""scrap DEI rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity"". In politics, commerce and education, a huge, potentially lasting counterrevolution seems to be under way. ""The death of DEI is finally here,"" wrote the columnist Michael Deacon in the Telegraph last year, ""and it's a joy to behold ... A radical progressive ideology that, in recent years, has held countless western institutions in its miserable grip ... is finally loosening."" For many companies, promoting diversity has only been a priority for a few years, since the surge of anti-racist activism set off around the world by Black Lives Matter in 2020. And in some ways the inclusive values of DEI and the winner-takes-all ethos of capitalism have always been an awkward fit. For all but the most ethical businesses, hiring and employing people in a more egalitarian way is less fundamental than maximising profits. In many supposedly diverse companies, progress towards a truly representative workforce, especially in senior positions, has been slow and far from complete. From rightwing and leftwing perspectives, it can be argued that diversity policies have just been a cynical experiment: yet another attempt to polish corporate capitalism's increasingly tarnished public image. Now that the political climate has changed, the experiment is being unceremoniously abandoned. But is the situation really that clearcut? One of the key features of current rightwing populism is a desire to escape complicated social realities, and so it is with the revolt against diversity. Thanks to globalisation, immigration and trends in birthrates, Britain and the US, like most other rich countries, are much more multicultural than they were in the 1980s - the last time there was a big conservative pushback against diversity policies. Between 1980 and 2019, the minority ethnic proportion of the US population doubled to 40% . In England and Wales, the proportion of people who didn't describe themselves as white British doubled between 2001 and 2021 alone: from one in eight to one in four. During these decades of flux, there were also profound shifts in how millions of Britons and Americans thought about feminism, gender, sexuality and disability. None of these socially embedded trends is likely to be completely reversed, however much rightwing populists rail against them. In a speech last week, Kemi Badenoch described diversity policies as ""poison"" , but the Conservatives have their own equal opportunities policy , with her face on the document's first page. It commits the party to being ""a supportive and inclusive environment where ... the diversity of people's backgrounds and circumstances will be positively valued ... [and] where the party will also continue to work towards its dedicated goal of encouraging and promoting equality and diversity"". It's easy to see these commitments as insincere or hypocritical, but they are also a sign of how far DEI ideas have spread. Back in the 1980s, the last transatlantic campaign against diversity policies was led by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Her government caricatured Labour councils that helped minorities as "" loony left "", and then took many of their powers away. Meanwhile, in the US, Ronald Reagan aimed to abolish the federal government's affirmative action programme, which he saw as "" bureaucratic "" social engineering. He also reduced funding for the agency that enforced equal opportunities employment law, drastically reducing the number of cases it brought against companies. But his counterrevolution got no further. Strong opposition - hard to imagine now - came from relatively liberal senior figures in the Republican party. More relevant to today, further support for diversity policies came from big business. ""When Reagan sought to tear down affirmative action,"" wrote the American sociologist Frank Dobbin in his 2009 book, Inventing Equal Opportunity, ""corporate America stood together to oppose the [president's] idea."" Businesses argued that diverse workforces made the best use of the country's range of talent and were more creative and productive, and more able to understand a broad spectrum of customers at home and abroad. Shrewdly, businesses also rebranded affirmative action in more neutral, less political language, as ""human resources management"". Reagan's attempt to abolish affirmative action was quietly abandoned. Might today's war on diversity fail in a similar way? The forces of white male supremacy have a more relentless rightwing media on their side than in Reagan and Thatcher's day. Donald Trump and other reactionary populists also seem less likely to compromise in culture wars than their more pragmatic conservative predecessors. Yet with multiculturalism now deeply entrenched, rooting out diversity policies will be harder than Trump's confident executive orders suggest. Legal opposition is building , and there are already signs that business is hiding its diversity programmes behind euphemisms again. On Tuesday, Apple shareholders voted against ending the company's diversity programme. ""DEI is being rebranded - not disbanded ,"" complained the rightwing New York Post recently. It pointed out that some companies widely thought to have dropped DEI continued to promote it on their websites in slightly modified language. If diversity policies increase profits - and according to the president of the British Chambers of Commerce, Martha Lane Fox , ""Businesses that embed diversity have 25% higher financial results"" - then even the most determined anti-DEI campaign is unlikely to totally prevail. Moreover, what the reactionaries want is less clear and coherent than it first seems. Do they want to restore a society utterly dominated by straight white men, which is almost certainly impossible? Or do they accept the existence of a diverse society, as long as it isn't actually shaped by diversity policies? On these questions, conservatives are divided. Even Trump sometimes acknowledges American diversity's permanence and importance. In his inauguration speech, he boasted of his ""increases in support from ... young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans ..."" Social conservatives around the world may be feeling triumphant now, but their revolt against diversity has probably come too late.",the Guardian,2025-02-26T08:00:06.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/26/donald-trump-straight-white-men-diversity-kemi-badenoch-business-multiculturalism-economy
"With Nato adrift and Brussels snubbed, is the UK key to Europe’s response to Trump?","A t moments of great crisis, national leaders and governments generally put their countries' (and their own) interests first. Transnational geopolitical, economic and security alliances are all very well. But if such organisations do not or cannot rise to the urgent challenges of the day, they risk being bypassed, ignored or shunted aside. This is the predicament now facing the European Union . After Donald Trump's appalling treatment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in full view of the watching world on Friday night, all agree that the US president's betrayal of Ukraine , sickening embrace of Russia and his blunt demand that Europe henceforth defend itself represent just such an extraordinary challenge, and one that must be swiftly addressed. Three developments stand out. One is that Europe's national leaders are taking charge of crisis management, pushing the EU Commission and, to a lesser degree, US-led Nato to one side. A second phenomenon is the Trump administration's unprecedented hostility to the EU as an institution. Trump says the EU was created to ""screw"" the US - a bizarre claim even by his semi-deranged standards. Now he is threatening 25% tariffs on EU imports . He is determined to exclude Brussels from talks on Ukraine. Yet he insists Europe must guarantee any future peace. The third, linked, development is the way Britain is unexpectedly being drawn back into the centre of European affairs after nearly a decade of self-imposed estrangement. The need to repair the dangerous folly of Brexit has never been so glaringly obvious. At the same time, Trump wants to use the UK not as a bridge, as Keir Starmer would like , but as a wedge to weaken and divide Europe. Among national leaders, Emmanuel Macron, France's president, is in the van. After Trump's volte-face, he convened an emergency summit in Paris. Then he hot-footed it last week to the White House, where he spoke for Europe in seeking a continuation of US security guarantees, not only for Ukraine but for the continent as a whole . Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor-elect, is busy urging fellow leaders to ""strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US "". He doubts Nato's usefulness ""in its current form"". Donald Tusk is also taking a prominent role - as Poland's prime minister, not as the holder of the EU's rotating presidency. Capitulation to Putin is unacceptable , he says, rebuking Trump. He wants others to match Poland's above-average defence spending. Where is the EU in this fast-moving crisis? Plodding slowly along. The presence of Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, in Kyiv for last week's anniversary of Russia's invasion was largely symbolic. She and the other top Brussels luminary, Antonio Costa, have been ghosted by Trump & co. It appears that no one in Washington sees any need to talk to the EU about Ukraine or anything else. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, is trying her best. She flew to the US last week, having finally secured an audience with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. While she was in the air, Rubio cancelled the meeting . It was a deeply offensive, calculated snub, intended to convey contempt for all things EU. after newsletter promotion Von der Leyen is scrambling to insert Brussels back into a debate that is passing it by. Another ""emergency"" EU summit is due this week , where a EUR20bn Ukraine aid package will be discussed. But as usual, consensus is lacking. Italy, Spain and Portugal are reportedly not keen. And pro-Putin Hungary may play its customary spoiler role, after trying to veto the EU's latest round of Russia sanctions. Important decisions may be put off again, to 19 March, when yet another summit will discuss pooled defence manufacturing, procurement and financing. The fact that an agreed plan to meet Trump's challenge may prove elusive even then illustrates the bigger problem: in a crisis, the 27-country EU is not nimble enough, too easily paralysed. The need for majority voting on key foreign and security issues and curbs on national vetoes grows urgent. This crisis will not wait. In the meantime, the onus is on national governments and mooted ""coalitions of the willing"" to keep Ukraine in the fight and prevent a Trump-Putin carve-up. And this is where Britain comes in. Starmer is coordinating closely with Macron on a ""reassurance force"" for Ukraine. And he is holding his own European leaders' summit in London to brief them on his talks with Trump . The wider political significance of a central UK role in boosting and re-organising Europe's post-Trump defence, outside the confines and constraints of the EU, is plain. Closer cooperation on security and intelligence could in time generate goodwill - and consequently, more non-EU, ad hoc government-to-government cooperation on UK-Europe trade, borders, free movement and other noisome Brexit hangovers. Nato is another multilateral organisation adrift in a world turned upside down. Ukraine aside, Trump's defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, hints at big cuts in US troops in Europe . Does Nato's article 5 all-for-one guarantee still hold? Would Trump fight if, say, Poland were attacked? Has the US nuclear umbrella, Nato's last resort, folded? These are genuine questions, unthinkable only months ago. Nato is traditionally led by a US general. But why have the Americans involved at all? Thirty of Nato's 32 members are European. It would certainly cost a bomb, but an alliance liberated from Trump could eventually produce the ""army of Europe"" that Ukraine and leaders like Macron talk about. It could deter Russia . And the US, if need be. At a moment in history when autocratic hyper-nationalists are trying to divvy up the world, multilateral organisations such as the EU, the African Union and the Arab League are more vital than ever. But not if they don't work. Many, including major UN agencies and the security council itself, need a wake-up call. Desperate times demand bold new thinking. The choice is clear: shape up - or be trumped.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T16:30:42.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/britain-europe-response-donald-trump-nato-brussels
"Five years on from the pandemic, how has Covid changed our world?","Stephen Reicher Professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy Great calamities often provoke reflections about the human condition. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 led people to reconsider their relationship with God, and compelled Voltaire to viciously lampoon Leibniz's notion that we live in the best of all possible worlds. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic forced people to rethink how they relate to the natural world, inspiring a new style of architecture, a new appreciation of the outdoors, and a range of back-to-nature movements. And Covid ... ? Well, judging by the coverage of the inquiry so far, the big issues seem to be how government figures used WhatsApp and who uttered which obscenity about whom. But despite this masterclass in trivialisation, Covid did have something profound to teach us about the relationship of individuals to society. For nearly two centuries, since the spectacular growth of cities sparked by the advent of industrialisation, western social thought has been obsessed with how to maintain control.Once people were concentrated together and physically separated from their erstwhile masters, would they still respect the old hierarchies? Or would they join together to dismantle them? This was reflected in a profound fear of the masses , particularly of crowds . The social elites lived in perpetual fear of the howling mobs. The outcome was a pervasive pessimism about the popular psyche and an entrenched anti-collectivism. This still dominates my discipline, psychology. It is reflected in the notion that human reasoning, at best, is inherently flawed, and that the flaws are accentuated when we act in groups. Such views are popular in government , and they shaped the initial response to Covid - with disastrous consequences. Remember "" behavioural fatigue "" - the notion that people would lack the psychological resilience to cope with stringent measures? This contributed to the delay of the first lockdown. Yet concerns that the masses wouldn't measure up were ill-founded. The common threat of Covid led people to develop a shared identity based around community. People became more concerned about the fate of others, which was reflected in enduring levels of adherence to stringent restrictions - even though, by following the lockdown rules, many suffered considerable hardships. Resilience, it turned out, was not something people lacked, but something that arises when people think and act as a group. For many, though, that realisation came too late. It has been estimated that, had Britain locked down a week earlier, it could have saved more than 30,000 people. Two weeks, and up to 40,000 more people would have survived. The cost of pessimistic individualism was ultimately measured in tens of thousands of lives. The Covid response of the UK government was shot through with the notion that we, the people, were very much part of the problem. Disdain was the defining feature of the Johnson government's approach, visible in his refusal to be candid about the challenges we faced, in the policy of blame and punishment for those breaking the rules, and in the government's refusal to engage with communities and provide them with the resources they needed to comply with the rules. It was perhaps best encapsulated by Matt Hancock's explanation for why the government repeatedly refused calls to increase support for self-isolation: because people would game the system . The story of Covid is one of an opportunity missed through ideological myopia. Far from being a problem, the public were the best asset the government had in dealing with the pandemic. Rather than harnessing that asset, ministers ignored and undermined it. They did so precisely because of their fear of the masses. So, for me, the big issue to come out of Covid is the need to rethink the relationship between the individual and the collective. Far from eroding our rationality, the group empowers us, makes us agents of our own fate and provides resilience in hard times. If we don't understand that, we will have learned nothing from Covid, and the next pandemic response will be as much of a shambles as the last. Sophie Mackintosh Author whose debut novel, The Water Cure, was longlisted for the 2018 Booker prize It's been five years since the start of the Covid pandemic, and yet there have been few novels grappling explicitly with its impact. Earlier this year I was speaking to the Norwegian author Helga Flatland about her novel Toxic , at the Kerala literature festival. It struck me that hers was one of the few books I've read that firmly locates itself in that specific era. The events are set in motion by the first lockdowns: the protagonist moves from Oslo to the countryside, and the novel is punctuated with Zoom calls, bubbles and online classes. In Toxic the pandemic is present, rather than viewed from a distance. But then, where are the big novels reflecting on what the experience has taught us, shown us? Has it even taught us anything, seeing as it seems our position, as a society, is mostly one of denial? Talking about ""pandemic literature"" as a concept also makes it seem as if it's over, when the lives of many people continue to be irrevocably altered by Covid. There's a clear beginning, but no definitive ending. Five years, in this context, seems like no time at all. I spoke to my editor, Hermione Thompson, editorial director at Hamish Hamilton, who agreed that it just still might be too soon. ""We start trying to make sense of an event from the moment it kicks off, and art which comes out of that white heat of experience can be incredibly powerful,"" she said. ""But you have to wait a bit longer - often a lot longer - for the wider picture to come into focus. And once you can see it, perhaps you have to wait a while more before you can bear to actually look at it."" Her submission pile is full of escapist stories. Readers, she told me, perhaps want ""to be taken as far away as possible from the frightening prospect of reality"". Perhaps it makes sense to think of Covid's impact on fiction as something more abstract. I've come to see my third novel, Cursed Bread , as a pandemic novel of sorts, though it's set in 1950s France, against the background of a mass poisoning. This appealed at the time, allowing me to escape as I wrote it in a frantic burst of energy between January 2020 and January 2021. But you can't shut out the world entirely, and it was only afterwards that I saw obvious influences: a novel about desire in which the protagonist is hardly touched, the impact of collective trauma, a feverish claustrophobia. Thompson singled out Ali Smith's Companion Piece , and last year's Booker prize winner, Orbital , as standout novels inspired by the experience of lockdown. But my favourite Covid novel is Burntcoat by Sarah Hall - released in October 2021, a mere 18 months after that first lockdown. Eerily prescient in its portrayal of a virus that lingers in the body, it's also expansive, asking questions about art, love and creation in the face of disaster. Written in that aforementioned ""white heat"", it didn't wait for the event to feel distant, but captured that strange time as it happened - and perhaps in that state of rawness yielded something that felt more true and significant. Rafael Behr Guardian columnist and leader writer What politicians do is generally more important than where they do it. But the pandemic brought an unusual focus on the spaces where power is wielded - the rooms where stuff happened; how many people were there; whether what they were doing counted as work under lockdown regulations. Those questions, and Boris Johnson's inability to give straight answers, ended up being more consequential for politics than the deadly effects of the virus itself. It was not the cost of bad decisions made in No 10 that brought down the prime minister, but the after-hours parties in the same building. Both failings were twin expressions of Johnson's disorderly character. A leader with an ethical compass who exuded professional discipline by day would not have generated a workplace culture that licensed rowdy piss-ups by night. Partygate was explosive because it made a mockery of millions of sacrifices by law-abiding citizens who had answered the call of duty to suspend their own needs, to forgo weddings, birthdays, funerals, in a communal struggle against the virus. It was the perfect scandal to mobilise resentment of a remote and arrogant political class that doesn't feel bound by rules it imposes on everyone else. This was hardly a new sentiment. But it was intensified by feelings of betrayal after the initial phase of the pandemic, which had been marked by a spirit of national solidarity. The prime minister benefited from that mood. His poll ratings were not dented by fatal early policy vacillations. His popularity peaked around the time that he was personally incapacitated by Covid. Johnson's landslide victory in the 2019 general election, on a pledge to ""get Brexit done"", conveyed a strong public appetite for calmer, less ferociously partisan politics. The first lockdown effectively delivered just that. The enabling law - monumentally draconian for a democracy - was bundled through parliament in four days. The famously raucous Commons chamber was muted by social distancing strictures. Chronic dysfunction at the centre, wasteful misallocation of resources, lethal hesitation and divisions over strategy - these didn't go unreported. There were intimations of the coming unravelling, not least in the furore around Dominic Cummings's notorious excursion to Barnard Castle. Politics was not suspended. But it was muted for months. With Partygate, the staggering degeneracy of Johnson's regime was vomited before the public gaze. The scale of administrative dysfunction and the deficit of accountability were functions of a political culture that resists modernisation, venerates dilettantism and conflates rhetorical dexterity with judgment. When Britain needed serious, sober leadership, it found itself at the mercy of inadequate, clownish whimsy. That was a tragedy but not an accident; a feature of the system, not a bug. The debauching of Downing Street during lockdown was unlawful and the prime minister's dishonest denials put him in contempt of parliament. Those were the technical offences that finished his career. But the true penalty is still being paid by everyone else. It is measured in heightened cynicism and depleted trust in governing institutions that need to command public confidence for democracy to function. Laleh Khalili Professor of Gulf studies at Exeter University and the author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian Peninsula Suzhou, a city in eastern China, is where the world's technology is made. Its factories produce products for companies such as Foxconn and Samsung, and are staffed by millions of labourers, mostly migrant workers from rural China. In late January 2020, Suzhou's municipal government, following Beijing's orders, took the unprecedented step of extending the lunar new year holidays and delaying the return of migrant workers. Transport in and out of China slowed to a crawl. Factory towns, including Suzhou, closed. While media coverage of lockdowns focused on their human impact, the pandemic transformed supply chains, and had a huge impact on global trade. At sea, ships were in effect stranded; with ports closed, there was nowhere to dock their cargo. International maritime treaties dictate that seafarers shouldn't spend more than 11 continuous months at sea. According to the International Maritime Organization, the number of sailors working long after the end of their contracts rose to 400,000 . Some remained on their ships for more than 22 months, wandering the world's seas with no end in sight. On land, last-mile logistics drivers delivering food and groceries were designated as frontline workers. In Britain, along with nurses and bus drivers, they were among the largest group of workers who became ill with Covid. Not everyone suffered from the effects of the virus. Shipping companies sought subsidies from governments, even as increased demand for goods meant their rates rose to their highest in history , netting them eye-watering profits. Because Chinese trade slowed, so too did the production, sale and export of personal protective equipment (PPE) beyond the Chinese border. Spying an opportunity, charlatans with excellent connections to the British government set up companies to provide PPE, and cleaned up on lucrative contracts for often defective or even nonexistent products. The week-long closure of the Suez canal in March 2021 by a ship run aground had little to do with Covid-19, but only confirmed the fragility of the ostensibly efficient and frictionless global logistical routes that defined our world. This realisation compelled some European and US corporations to shift their factories nearer to home, to the peripheries of Europe or the Mexican borderlands. The US had already been threatening a trade war with China long before the slowdown, and ""nearshoring"" neatly fitted with this new strategic posture. During his first term as president, Donald Trump blamed the pandemic on alleged biological warfare by the Chinese government. In his second term, some of the stories he spun back then can be marshalled for a new purpose. Capitalism's common features - the offshoring of industry, the outsourcing of labour and the skyrocketing costs of shipping - can now be blamed on a nefarious Chinese agenda. As Trump effects a flurry of executive orders implementing tariffs against China and many other trading partners, we're seeing the new era of trade that Covid helped to accelerate. Frances Ryan Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People My earliest memory is the tins of peas. A couple of weeks into the first Covid lockdown, I was getting used to being stuck at home 24/7. Like millions of other clinically vulnerable people, the shielding programme meant I wasn't even supposed to go to the shops for fruit and veg (or gin). In the back of the cupboard, I was relieved to find some vitamins and, with them, a shred of hope. It was a hard time for many, of course, but a few things made it easier. With theatres and the pub closed, entertainment was beamed remotely to our front rooms - access many disabled people had long dreamed of . At the same time, the public were taking Covid protections - from masks to testing - that helped keep those of us at high risk as safe as we could be. Five years on, I would like to say such progress continued but I think we all know that would be a lie. Remote access to social and cultural events has largely been revoked now non-disabled people no longer need it. While WFH has been normalised, it's repeatedly dismissed as an excuse to skive . Since the last legal Covid protections were removed in 2022 , clinically vulnerable people have been left with the ""choice"" of in effect shielding indefinitely or risking our lives each time we go out. Many disabled readers have told me they no longer feel able to do simple things like have a pint with a friend. Others with long Covid have lost jobs and relationships. The ""return to normal"" did not include everyone. It isn't simply that the things that helped clinically vulnerable people to stay safe have gone - there's pushback to the idea that we even deserve them. Simply wearing a mask ourselves in 2025 - let alone asking someone else to - is enough to get yelled at by a stranger in Tesco. It feels at times as if the pandemic unmasked (no pun intended) a blend of denial and resentment towards disabled people, as if our needs are simultaneously a reminder of a time society would rather forget, and evidence of a sense of entitlement from an uppity minority. As one district nurse told me last year when I asked if she would mind testing for Covid before she came to my home if I gave her a lateral flow test: ""It isn't for people like you to tell us what to do."" Whether it's anger over the benefits bill or a bus having a priority wheelchair space , there's a longstanding prejudice that disabled people are costly and demanding when all we are asking is to be able to live. In that way, the pandemic didn't change negative attitudes towards disability - it just exacerbated them. It's natural to want to gain from a bad situation, as if all the pain wasn't for nothing. Perhaps, though, real progress comes in being honest: in saying we tried for equality and solidarity but fell short. It is only in admitting our shortcomings as a country that we will ever do better for disabled people - to figuratively dig in the back of the cupboard together and find the peas. William Davies Sociologist and political economist. His latest book is Unprecedented? How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy From time to time, a student contacts me having found a relic from the 2020-2021 academic year. Not some social distancing tool, although campuses still have plastic screens that haven't yet been disposed of, or the bits of gaffer tape on carpet that students were instructed not to cross. No, these students have come across some actual treasure: a lecture video , still stored in the cloud, but no longer accessible. The question is: since they can't attend a lecture, can I release the video instead? There are usually practical reasons why not. Lectures change from year to year. But the bigger question this poses is what is the case for in-person attendance in the first place? Universities made it through the pandemic thanks to digital platforms and ""edtech"". The difficulty is how to put the genie back in the bottle, and resuscitate what made a campus a valuable space of congregation in the first place. As in schools, falling student attendance levels are one of the many scars left by Covid-19. Putting the other mental-health legacies of lockdowns to one side for a moment, they also triggered a social crisis: for a period of time, it became possible, necessary and - to some extent - convenient to live your life from your bedroom. With that option established, busy corridors, lecture halls and conversational seminars may seem confusing and sometimes even threatening. What's more, there is no question that for a generation raised with YouTube and smartphones it makes perfect sense to ""consume"" a lecture at the time, place and even speed of one's choosing. Note-taking can become verbatim with the availability of closed captioning. How does a university or individual lecturer stand in the way of this without merely seeming conservative or obstructive? There are plenty of valid benefits of a thriving campus and classroom, such as forging identities, making friends or participating in sports and political campaigns. Universities are now at pains to emphasise these, seeking to make their campuses more ""sticky"" via the introduction of additional cafes, social spaces and gyms. But at some point, the pedagogical question needs to be confronted: why can't we just release a load of content? Profit-hungry edtech providers and the consultants hoovering up fees in the current maelstrom of cost-cutting won't want the question to die. The answer ultimately lies in cultivating in students a tolerance for ambiguity - the ambiguity of social space, the ambiguity of exactly what a lecturer (or text) meant, and the ambiguity of what counts as a ""good"" argument or essay. At risk of romanticising the experience of in-person teaching and learning, it offers at its best a kind of collective holding environment in which it is OK to be uncertain or ignorant about things, safe in the knowledge that this uncertainty and ignorance will gradually recede. A teaching space contains all sorts of relationships, both tacit and formal, that ensure learning is never a simple transaction or transmission of information. In such communities, not everything is divided into ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" answers. For a period of time, Covid inserted a digital interface into billions of social relations, turning educational exchange into a type of game, in which there are ""moves"", ""scores"" and ""results"", but no productive ambiguity. This was a disaster for the young people who became trapped in bedrooms, with their education reduced to mechanical inputs and outputs. The struggle to reverse this continues. Devi Sridhar Chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author of How Not to Die (Too Soon) I recently had to teach master's students about the pandemic and could feel my heart rate quicken at the prospect. ""Collective amnesia"" is the best way to describe how the world has since decided to approach Covid. We'd rather forget the initial fears about the disease, the trauma of hearing the daily death toll, the rainbow signs in windows and the lockdowns. If you survived, it's easy to look back and think it wasn't that bad. Those who died aren't around to contribute their views, although their loved ones have made powerful interventions. A colleague who lost his 34-year-old son in 2021 reminded me that these voices aren't heard enough. More than 230,000 people in the UK have lost their lives to the disease. This is how I narrate what occurred during the pandemic. In 2020, governments that had a consistent message and coherent plan - such as Sweden and South Korea - used public health measures such as mass testing, masks and awareness campaigns, and didn't have to resort to severe interventions, or even lockdowns. In the summer of 2020, trial data indicated we would soon have vaccines. At this point, every country should have been trying to buy time before the vaccines could be rolled out, using tests to identify cases and stop chains of infection. Doing this without causing significant disruption to education, society and the economy was a huge challenge. Some countries and regions managed to strike the right balance. Others did not. Once vaccines arrived in December 2020 , the objective shifted. Instead of just containing the spread of Covid-19, health authorities began trying to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. Countries that pivoted quickly to this strategy, such as New Zealand and South Korea, managed to avoid major loss of life. Those that continued trying to contain the virus without promoting vaccines across their populations, such as China and Hong Kong, suffered a delayed wave of Covid cases and a high death toll. As a public health expert, a lingering question I now ask myself is whether something like this could happen again, within our lifetimes. Avian flu is spreading across the US and infecting birds and cows. Meanwhile, an unidentified illness found in bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already killed more than 50 people . Both of these examples show that outbreaks are inevitable and unpredictable. It would be over simplistic to claim that, as a society, we overreacted to Covid. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can prevent a similar pandemic from occurring again. Avian flu is currently one of the most concerning diseases. If it begins to spread among humans, and carries a high fatality rate, governments won't need to ask people to stay home. Those people will look around at their loved ones, hear what's happening to families and in hospitals, and make decisions about their safety for themselves. That's why collective amnesia is the wrong response to Covid. No matter how much we might wish to forget it ever happened, we should now be focusing on building resilience for the next pandemic, and investing in science, particularly vaccine programmes. That would be a far better way to honour the legacy of those who died from this disease. Rachel Shabi Author of Not the Enemy - Israel's Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About Antisemitism The stats alone show us the significance of Covid mutual aid groups. By April 2020, a month after Britain's first national lockdown was announced, a network of about 4,000 mutual aid groups was up and running. One survey in May that year reported that 10 million people in the UK were involved in some form of volunteering in response to the pandemic. Analysis of the impact of these groups has appraised them as having been essential in keeping society's most vulnerable afloat during the Covid crisis. Mutual aid plugged a giant hole left by a seemingly indifferent and incompetent government, whether by providing food deliveries, prescription-runs and dog-walks, or casting a mental safety net to the lonely and isolated, with regular check-ins across a (socially distanced) doorstep. Mutual aid, a term coined by the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, is a hyperlocal system of support premised on the slogan ""solidarity not charity"". It is about horizontal, two-way support: the idea that we all gain from helping each other because humans are wired to collaborate and connect; to participate and to share. It is fundamentally a political idea, even if not always articulated that way by those involved. When I interviewed mutual aiders across the country, volunteers often described it as providing meaning and purpose in a way that regular paid work did not. While these groups were at their peak, there was talk of society being rebuilt from the bottom up, the process itself creating a new collective push for a different kind of party politics. It didn't really turn out that way, even though mutual aid itself did not go away when the worst of the pandemic died down. A report in 2022 suggested that four in 10 of the mutual aid groups set up during the pandemic were still going, with many focused on helping communities cope with the cost of living crisis. Today, we still see versions of mutual aid everywhere, from disaster-relief groups dealing with the fires that raged across Los Angeles, to the networks providing food, medical relief and safe zones in response the humanitarian catastrophe of Sudan's war. It springs up whenever a crisis meets an inadequate state response. In other words, mutual aid still thrives precisely because it is a way for people to connect and do something in response to multiple, spiralling global crises, even as they grow increasingly disengaged from party politics. It is both the failure of and alienation from big ""P"" politics that drives support for mutual aid, as governments do not meaningfully address the climate emergency or redress terrible social iniquities. It's hard to see how the dots between community organising and political pressure might connect. But perhaps that is to miss the point of mutual aid. The shift is in the tissue of the relationships forged, the practice of accountability to each other. Amid a global surge in far-right politics premised on competitive individualism, mutual aid builds awareness that societies can instead be founded on collectivism - and those that do will thrive. Helen McCarthy Historian and author of Double Lives: A History of Working Motherhood Women's working lives changed after March 2020 in complicated ways. Many found themselves on the frontline of the NHS. In other sectors historically dominated by women, such as retail and hospitality, workers were imperilled by restrictions, and millions were furloughed. Meanwhile, school and nursery closures meant that frazzled mothers now had to juggle Zoom calls with round-the-clock childcare. Five years on, how does the picture look for working women? As a historian, it is hard to resist comparisons with an earlier crisis, the second world war, which mobilised millions of women and helped kickstart the dramatic growth in their employment that swept the second half of the 20th century. Covid hasn't done anything like that. On the eve of the virus, the female employment rate was high - 72% - and it has barely changed since. But that headline figure may mask the effects of the pandemic on older women, thousands of whom have moved out of the workforce into early retirement, or are now classed as "" economically inactive "". This trend has also affected men, but women's reasons for not being in work are more likely to include caring for family or long-term illness, including long Covid , of which there are more female sufferers than male. These numbers also conceal the pressures experienced by mothers who are barely hanging on to their jobs owing to the lack of affordable childcare. The UK's problems with childcare did not start in 2020, but the chaos of lockdowns exacerbated staff shortages. Many workers left the sector for more stable and less stressful jobs, and costs have continued to spiral. At the start of the pandemic, there were hopes that the pivot to remote working would help working parents achieve a better balance by cutting out the commute and giving them more control over their time. Before 2020, only one in eight workers reported working from home. That figure has now risen to two in five . Here, there's an echo of the second world war, when part-time shifts were promoted to sceptical employers as a means of recruiting housewives to munitions factories that desperately needed labour. By the 1980s, about a third of working-age women were employed part-time . Those jobs were typically low-skilled, low-paid and carried fewer rights than full-time jobs. Today's hybrid workers, by contrast, are more likely to be well-paid professionals. They are also more likely to be men. Initially, there was a sense that fathers would embrace equal, hands-on parenting styles if they spent more time at home. If anything, workplace inequalities have persisted. True, some mothers in white-collar occupations have undoubtedly benefited from hybrid working. But much larger numbers of women remain in jobs that are less amenable to home-based work, including those in hospitals, care homes and supermarkets. It is cruelly ironic that one of the few positive legacies of the pandemic is mostly unavailable to those whose essential labour got Britain through the crisis. Samira Shackle Journalist and the author of Karachi Vice In July 2023, the US politician Robert Kennedy Jr was filmed saying that ""Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people"" and that the US ""put hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes"". Now, in February 2025, Kennedy is US health secretary. It is a stark example of a much broader phenomenon: in the five years since the Covid pandemic began, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringes of society to the centres of power. During the pandemic, more people began to doubt authorities, expertise and elites. Populist movements, including some explicitly rooted in conspiracies, already existed before Covid - but the pandemic significantly broadened their appeal. QAnon began in 2017, as a response to (false) claims that Hillary Clinton was the leader of an elite cabal of paedophiles, but by 2020, its supporters were campaigning against masks and vaccines . This is indicative of the way in which conspiracy movements adapt and cross-pollinate; during the pandemic, we also saw longtime conspiracy grifters such as David Icke and Piers Corbyn taking on Covid as a cause, as that's where a new audience lay. When I reported on the rise of Covid conspiracies in the miserable locked-down spring of 2021, it struck me that many of the people I spoke to had started with reasonable concerns. They were isolated, angry, and suffering financially and emotionally as a result of lockdowns. They had a sense that something wasn't right, and the idea that the pandemic was being exaggerated, or was cover for something more sinister, provided an explanation. (As the writer Naomi Klein has said : ""Conspiracy culture gets the facts wrong, but the feeling is right."") I spoke to some people over the course of a few months, and as they became more immersed in the online world of conspiracies, their initial views became more extreme - perhaps a shift from questioning the origins of the pandemic to full-blown vaccine scepticism. ""I've definitely fallen out with the government, and I will never, ever trust them again,"" one woman told me. The pandemic vastly expanded the number of people who feel this way. As a general rule, once someone has engaged fully in one set of conspiracy theories, investing time and energy in them, and probably losing real-world friends in the process, they become more receptive to other conspiracies too. And those who peddle these theories online adapt their views according to what is most popular or expedient. People who came to prominence talking about the pandemic have since moved on to other issues, taking their audience with them. A number of British Telegram groups set up during the pandemic to oppose lockdowns and vaccinations have switched to far-right messaging , for instance. The pandemic and associated lockdowns may have receded from the public imagination, but people who really bought into the conspiracies swirling around it haven't gone back to thinking how they did before. In an increasingly fragmented media environment, and with conspiracists sitting in positions of huge political power in the US, this is a problem for us all. Rachel Clarke Palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking : Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Almost exactly five years ago, Dave Jones, an ICU consultant in Wales, posted a tweet that made NHS colleagues cheer. ""The NHS reminds me of a hippopotamus. It might sometimes appear slow, maybe a bit bloated and somewhat unresponsive. But my god, this last week or so has shown that like a hippo, it can move bloody fast and have some awesome power when it needs to."" He had captured brilliantly the breakneck transformation - unprecedented in NHS history - of every inch of the health service to cope with the onslaught of Covid. Hospitals ripped up the rules and demolished conventions to double or treble their ICU capacities. In under a month, 33,000 extra patient beds were created - the equivalent of building 53 new district general hospitals across the country. Barriers dissolved, silos vanished. Red tape - this time of the literal kind - suddenly reconfigured our A&E into ""hot"" and ""cold"" zones - the kind of thing that in the NHS normally takes 26 committees and two years to achieve. Money and bureaucracy, for once, were no object. We all worked together to do what was right. What shocks me today is how little of that mind-blowing dynamism remains. Then, staff were unleashed to transform our systems to help patients. Now, we're back in the old quagmire of inertia, bureaucracy and system-says-no because there's no money to do anything differently. A new government has promised an NHS revolution, but patients are still dying on trolleys in corridors . Social care - yet again - isn't a government priority. Trusts still can't, or won't, pay for doctors to fill the rota gaps to keep patients safe at night. Staff struggle against the system to give patients the care they deserve. In particular, it astounds me that five years after an airborne virus wreaked such deadly havoc, NHS England has failed to act on all the lessons learned. This winter, NHS leaders loudly blamed a viral ""quad-demic"" for the appalling crisis conditions in our hospitals, as though somehow natural forces had tied the government's hands. Yet three of those four viruses - influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Covid-19 - are spread through the air. Why haven't Hepa filters been installed in all our hospitals and GP surgeries when we know they effectively remove the virus particles breathed in by staff and patients? Where were the universal mask mandates for staff to help reduce the spread? Why was the default mask for staff the flimsy paper variety, not the significantly more protective FFP2 kind? It is surely the falsest of economies to stick to cheap paper when you know this will lead to higher rates of staff infection, endangering patients and causing staff to be too unwell to work. As the Covid inquiry creaks on , I have been unnerved to find myself agreeing with Dominic Cummings's testimony. Cummings has excoriated the groupthink, inertia and monolithic assumptions that dominate the actions of government, the civil service and the NHS. He's right. We often talk about those electrifying months, five years ago, when we were liberated - and supported - to make the radical changes our patients needed. If only the same were true now.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T09:00:35.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/five-years-covid-first-lockdown-lives-changed
"I may be a pan-cultural youth vampire, but I think I’ll leave gen Z to their slang","For some time I've wondered if there is anything - anything at all - young people can have just for themselves, without older people trying to gatecrash the party? A Tesco Mobile survey has revealed the slang words and phrases that generation Z uses, and which confuse their parents and older people in general. This is the traditional point when one is supposed to muse, baffled, over youth vernacular, perhaps balk at the Clockwork Orange- esque strangeness of it all. Sure enough, there are some I don't know: ""poggers"" (enthusiasm); ""drip"" (stylish clothes/accessories); ""touch grass"" (time outside). However, others I've heard of: ""finsta"" (fake Instagram account to fool parents); ""NPC"" (non-player character; a nobody); ""clout"" (influence); ""rizz"" (charisma); ""brat"" (confident, rebellious). In fact, there are quite a few on the list I already know. Too many. First, it should be acknowledged that it is a modern parent's inalienable human right to wind their children up by deploying their slang back at them. After picking up the phrase from Love Island , I had months of fun telling my youngest daughter not to ""deep it"" (overthink something). The good news: it appears that I am not the 21st - century equivalent of the 20th-century judge who hadn't heard of the Beatles . The bad news: I could be something far worse. A pan-cultural youth-vampire, sinking my old, greedy, generation X fangs deep into the young - their words, clothes, music, TV, films - and refusing to let go. What's more, look around, and it's clear I'm not alone. You'll have heard of cultural appropriation: the hijacking of the culture of others by a dominant people or society without recognition or permission. Perhaps there's a form of generational appropriation that involves older people commandeering youth-signifiers, to the point they leave nothing that actual young people can identify as just their own. What music do you listen to? Is it that different from young people? Do you feel you have the full, non-embarrassed run of Spotify? What programmes do you watch? What food do you eat? Do you buy your clothes from strictly demarcated grownup shops, or do you end up online looking at jackets, shoes and tops aimed at younger people, rationalising that they won't look like that on you, so that's completely fine and normal? If the urban myths are to be believed, young people can barely go to gigs or festivals without their parents trying to tag along (well, they did have to buy the tickets). They can't rebelliously get tiny ankle tattoos because their parents have made them an uncool, middle-aged quirk. And so it goes on. For some time now, older generations haven't just observed youth, as they have always done - they have taken from it, filleted it, sucked it dry and nourished themselves. It's not as if there is anything new per se about older people invading youth culture. As far back as the 1990s, tax-paying, property-owning adult men riding skateboards, and grownup professional women modelling Little Miss Naughty T-shirts, were being observed out in the wild. And, after all, where is the harm - why should people have to stiffly keep to their own age brackets, or be made to feel old before their time? Moreover, it's understandable that people are fascinated by younger generations, as well as, at times, alarmed and saddened. All those reports about young people shirking sex and alcohol (laudable and smart, in many ways). The pernicious effect of online porn and mobile phones (only last week, Denmark banned them from classrooms and after-school clubs). The cyclical concern about mental health (last year, one in three in the 18-24 bracket had reported mental health issues such as anxiety or depression). Has gen Z struggled a lot more than previous cohorts, or just refused to be stigmatised and silent about it? after newsletter promotion With gen Z, it has occurred to me before that theirs is a youth interrupted, or maybe youth postponed - almost as if they can be young later, at a less pressured and exhausting time. Which is hardly surprising, considering all the other factors making young lives dark and difficult: climate change; the pandemic; tuition fees plunging them into sinkholes of debt; war; injustice... the list sprawls on. Still, older people being concerned about younger generations is one thing; gatecrashing their culture quite another. In all the debates that periodically ignite about gen Z, amid the constant scrutiny and conjecture, are we guilty of forgetting that they've been deprived all along of the one thing most older people could take for granted: a youth-scape to call their own? As for ""Where's the harm?"", are we kidding ourselves? In the realm of music alone, older generations might have inadvertently helped to hike up the costs, and price young people out. If older people weren't involved in elite big-ticket pop concerts and music festivals (paying for their children, or actually attending), would there be any justification (or market) for them preposterously costing hundreds of pounds? Beyond mere student discounts, should there be official age-tested sharply reduced tickets so that actual young people can afford them? Similarly, concern over mobile phones in classrooms is reasonable, but perhaps phones are one of the few spaces where young people achieve a modicum of generational privacy and agency. And what is slang if not an attempt to have a private, secret language (like Polari was back when it was illegal and dangerous to be gay). Is that why teenagers update it so often - they want to keep it just for themselves, locking out nosy fogies like me? At this late stage of what could be termed generational osmosis, there is no stuffing the genie back into the bottle, but we could at least be aware. Listen, fam, no need to deep it. Just sometimes, back off, and let the young have some cultural space to themselves.",the Guardian,2025-03-01T19:00:49.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/01/i-may-be-a-pan-cultural-youth-vampire-but-i-think-ill-leave-gen-z-to-their-slang
"The BBC wanted black listeners and turned to Tim Westwood, white son of a vicar. A parable for our times","M ore than 30 years have passed since Tim Westwood joined the BBC, 12 since he left and three since Guardian and BBC journalists reported on allegations of abuse by a man considered by the corporation to be the voice of hip hop. Then this week, some of the many concerns raised during his 19 years working there were detailed in the latest edition of one of the BBC's weightiest and longest-running series, Official Reports into Men We Employ Behaving Very Badly. Westwood's career at the Beeb ended in 2013, amid a flurry of accusations and a sense of deja vu best summarised as ""oh God, not another one"". But the 174-page report is well worth reading, not just for what it says about the BBC but, as so often with the media, what it says about attitudes in Britain. First, there's the heartbreaking testimony from so many young women, mainly young Black women - claims of abuse that they say left them feeling so awful they blamed themselves or ended up contemplating suicide. Many did not realise the alleged behaviour was wrong until they were much older and admitted they didn't report it at the time as they feared they would not be believed or would be blamed. The worst allegations are redacted because of ongoing police investigations. Westwood has denied all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and says he has not had the opportunity to answer the allegations, partly because of the ongoing police investigation. Then there was the apparent blind-eye turning to let's just call it dodgy behaviour by a man who was not only considered a star, but was one of just two BBC presenters in 1997 to have, according to BBC research ""made an impact with young Black and Asian listeners"". Yes there are the many junior staff members who complained of bullying and harassment but ended up being moved instead of the main man, but there is also in this scandal the extra spice of the BBC's patronising efforts to be not only down with the kids but down with Black and minority kids. Let's call it the ""Ali G factor"". Westwood, the public school-educated son of an Anglican bishop turned pirate radio DJ, joined BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to launch the UK's first national hip-hop radio show. He was described as a ""dominant force"" in rap music, a genre popular among the young people, particularly Black ones, who didn't listen to the BBC. Both of the BBC Radio 1 controllers in charge during Westwood's tenure mentioned the need for the BBC to attract this demographic. The Radio 1 controller between 1998 and 2001 described Westwood as being ""bilingual"", able to speak to BBC management in a language they understood and could also ""authentically connect"" with a young minority audience. Westwood's bad language and sexualised commentary was, according to a BBC executive quoted in the report ""a sort of swaggering hip hop cartoon character"". When asked in 2017 for the highlights of his time running the station, Matthew Bannister started with "" Westwood's rammed stage at the Notting Hill carnival "". So, in summary, the BBC hired the white, middle-class son of a vicar who affected the vulgar language of rappers (and once met the Notorious BIG and was, sort of, friends with Pharrell Williams) in an effort to increase cultural representation and appeal to Black and Asian listeners on the national broadcaster. Let that sink in. Could there be a greater example of the dangers of Auntie throwing all caution to the wind to be down with the kids, kids she feels are not her own, kids she doesn't understand, kids she apparently made little genuine effort to understand? The report leads to many conclusions, but one that seems inescapable is how much the BBC still needs diversity among its staff. It must be obvious this does not mean middle-aged posh white boys pretending to be Black. It means more people of colour, some of them minority women. The problem of under-representation in the media is not unique to the BBC and at least the corporation has made strides to get better. In 2019 Lorna Clarke, a Black woman, became first, controller of pop and then director of music at the BBC. But despite a target of 20% minority ethnic staff, just 17% of its staff are not white . The BBC response to this latest report shows that some things have been learned since the run of scandals going back to Savile in 2011. In a statement that outlined changed processes since and promised to do better, the BBC admitted that it had for too long ""been too siloed [and] deferential to high profile individuals"". New processes for complaints to allow allegations to be looked at together rather than piecemeal are also in place. A review into its broader culture launched by Samir Shah , its first minority ethnic chair as well as a distinguished former journalist, will be produced by the end of this year. This review should consider the culture of silence around inappropriate behaviour by many powerful men, some of whom were moulded and feted by the BBC. But it should also address the lazy thinking that led to this scandal, this trauma - continuing for so many victims - while everyone looked the other way. The problem with saying ""not again"" is that we keep on having to say it.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T11:00:09.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/bbc-black-listeners-tim-westwood-report
"It’s the Kemi delusion: the more the Tories run towards Reform, the more their voters will run to the Lib Dems","W hat times these are. As Donald Trump's sellout of Ukraine gains pace, there are reports that Keir Starmer will flatter the president by inviting him to address parliament. Meanwhile, Trump's British admirers continue to offer flimsy excuses and undimmed admiration. Before Trump paid tribute to Nigel Farage - a ""great guy"" - in his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Washington, the MP for Clacton used his time at the same event to ""hail"" Trump's ""progress"" with Vladimir Putin, and salute him as "" simply the bravest man that I know "". By way of bathos, the dependably ridiculous Liz Truss had by then told a much smaller crowd that the country she ran for a month and a half is ""failing"", and needs its own Trumpian insurgency. At the top of the party Truss so briefly led, Kemi Badenoch cannot resolve a familiar contradiction - between a dazzled liking of Trump's ideology, and the political inconvenience of what it means in practice. Late last week, she parroted the obligatory half-arsed rebuttal of Trump's attack on the Ukrainian president. ""President Zelenskyy is not a dictator,"" she said, as if that were a revelation. But any observer of her recent engagements will know where her heart really lies. Badenoch epitomises the absurdity gripping a huge chunk of the British right, as it issues warnings about the collapse of western civilisation while cosying up to people hellbent on pulling the roof in on just about every basic tenet of liberal democracy, along with what remains of the transatlantic basis of international security. She and her allies' understanding of such basic contradictions is about as thorough as her weekly preparation for prime minister's questions , but that hardly diminishes her belief in a cultish, paranoid set of beliefs. So out it all comes, on a weekly basis. Last week, she found time in her diary for a turn at the annual conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), an international initiative co-founded by that great modern sage Jordan Peterson. ""Take a look at President Trump,"" she told her audience . ""He's shown that sometimes you need that first stint in government to spot the problems. But it's the second time around when you really know how to fix them. And it starts by telling the truth."" Her chosen verities were the same as ever: an insistence that an ""intellectual elite"" is in control of everything, along with warnings about ""the poisoning of minds that is happening in higher education"", and ""leftwing progressivism, whether it's pronouns or DEI or climate activism"". At the same event, she was asked about Elon Musk and his so-called department of government efficiency. ""I don't even think Doge is radical enough,"" she said. Who is this stuff for? If her aim is to stop the Reform UK insurgency, she is speaking in far too abstract and pointy-headed a vocabulary, a problem made worse by the lack of frontline Tory politicians who can compete with Farage's regular-bloke affectations. But there is another consideration missing: the plain fact that being gleefully resident in a hard-right echo-chamber is guaranteed to further alienate millions of voters that the Tories have lost. As I read reports of Badenoch's speech, I found myself thinking of Woking, the quiet corner of the Surrey commuter belt that is the epitome of a sea change that Badenoch - along with most of her party - has chosen to ignore. Last summer, the Liberal Democrats took the constituency from the Conservatives on a 19% swing . Some of that shift was down to the spectacular bankruptcy of the borough council thanks to reckless decisions taken by a Tory administration. But the result was in keeping with a huge pile of Lib Dem gains that rippled through the home counties and beyond, yet received a lot less attention than the five seats won by Reform. They still read like a litany of Tory woe : Guildford, Surrey Heath, Bicester and Woodstock, Horsham, Cotswolds South, Carshalton and Wallington, Tunbridge Wells - scores of Lib Dem gains, which came after a Tory collapse in local government. It was not hard to work out why. In many of them, a majority of voters had backed Remain in the 2016 referendum. The subsequent Tory embrace of hard Brexit left them reeling, and Boris Johnson's amoral style of leadership only furthered their quiet despair. But there is something much deeper afoot in these places. These parts of England are assuredly modern, and often more ethnically diverse than they used to be. They are often not quite as affluent as their reputation suggests, but still full of people who are mindful of the health of the economy. Those voters would be in the market for a centre-right party that emphasised the wonders of property ownership and low taxes, and pledged to back the interests of business. What they find repellent, in my experience , is the Tory turn into fanaticism, and the sense that Farage - and now Trump - are pulling the strings. Needless to say, they do not get on their commuter trains every morning and chat animatedly about such hard-right talking-points as ""cultural Marxism"", being trapped in 15-minute cities , and the need to have more kids so as to preserve Judeo-Christian culture. In my experience, almost nobody in Britain does. As Badenoch blithely follows the bright light of hard-right politics, what is her offer to these voters? I know this much with certainty: that they do not look at the chaos and disorder gripping the US and Trump's torching of international norms as something to emulate, but instead feel a mounting anxiety. In the past, part of the genius of British Conservatism lay in the way it responded to times of such turbulence by offering the balm of tradition, and the idea that old institutions and conventions would endure. Now, Badenoch and her ilk seem to want to joyously throw us into the fire. Her choice of engagements is a small part of the same wretched picture. Last week, she did an interview with Peterson in which she talked about the party that has gobbled up so many old Tory heartlands, and is now making a point of constantly attacking Trump. The Lib Dems, she said, have ""silly and foolish"" ideas. But other things she blurted out were much more revealing. ""They don't have much of an ideology other than being nice,"" she went on, as if niceness was always to be avoided. ""A typical Liberal Democrat will be somebody who is good at fixing their church roof. And, you know, the people in the community like them. They are like, 'Fix the church roof, you should be a member of parliament.'"" Didn't those people used to be Conservatives ? If they have walked away, Badenoch's accelerating turn into secondhand Trumpism is not going to pull them back. Large parts of what used to be called middle England, in fact, now surely look at the party that once confidently spoke for them and recoil: this is the Tory crisis that yet another leader shows no signs of understanding.",the Guardian,2025-02-23T12:42:16.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/23/kemi-delusion-more-tories-run-towards-reform-more-their-voters-run-lib-dems
The Guardian view on pornography: the Obscene Publications Act needs an update,"I t is news to nobody that the internet has enabled an unprecedented explosion of pornographic material. There is widespread awareness, too, that much of this is far more violent than used to be the norm in adult sexual publishing and entertainment - with more extreme content understood to drive engagement, as it does across the internet. The UK's Online Safety Act should block children from accessing disturbing and unsuitable content. It is shameful that age-verification legislation took so long. The independent report on pornography delivered to ministers this week ought to be the next step in a national effort to deal with the proliferation of online sexual violence. As Peter Kyle, the science secretary, said on Thursday, it is an authoritative piece of work. When he meets its author, Gabby Bertin, next week, he should commit to act on her recommendations. Draft guidance from Ofcom , regarding material currently defined as legal but harmful, is under consultation. But Lady Bertin is right to demand that ministers go further. While clear-sighted about the disproportionate harms to women, she notes, too, the dangers to boys and men, and highlights the prospect that problematic pornography use could be classed as an addiction . The initial response from ministers suggests that making strangulation pornography illegal will, rightly given the associated risks, be prioritised. This is one of several areas in which the gap between the rules governing online and offline content is both wrong and illogical. Material that is illegal to distribute in physical form (in films or DVDs) ought to be prohibited online as well. It is shocking that payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard have, until now, been the closest thing there is to a regulator of the vast online pornography industry. The goal is not blanket censorship, but preventing harmful content from being produced, promoted and easily accessed, especially by minors. Ministers' reiteration of pledges to ban deepfake nude images and strengthen the law on intimate image abuse is also welcome. So is the acknowledgment that police tracking and recording of online sexual offences need to be improved, partly to increase understanding and evidence of links with ""real life"" violence. Even with the Online Safety Act in place, the current laws dating back to the Obscene Publications Act are inadequate and poorly enforced. Statutory codes as well as legislation could be used to close loopholes. The government's commitment to halve violence against women and girls must point to a more robust overall approach. Measures to protect performers should include a new right to withdraw consent - meaning that pornographic content would be taken down. The existence of pornography categories including incest , step-incest and ""teens"", points to dark aspects of sexuality that many people would rather ignore - and partly explains the extraordinary laxness with which the industry is treated. The safety by design measures in the Online Safety Act must be used to compel businesses to stop promoting material that is harmful but not illegal. Regulation of the sex industry is an international issue as well as a domestic one. But Lady Bertin directs her challenge to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper , in particular. For too long, she argues, pornography policy has been dispersed across government, leaving no one fully in charge. The review makes a powerful case that Ms Cooper should take it on.",the Guardian,2025-02-27T18:29:39.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-pornography-the-obscene-publications-act-needs-an-update
BP dropping its green ambitions is a travesty. But that’s exactly how capitalism works,"I t would be very easy to be sharply critical of BP, given its sudden volte-face on its environmental commitments. Under pressure from a shareholder, Elliott Management, it has abandoned the green ambitions it announced in 2020 and pivoted squarely back to an overwhelming focus on oil and gas. While easy, it would arguably be unhelpful, and perhaps even misguided. Because viewed in the round, this isn't really about BP: it's about capitalism at large, and its inability to respond to the climate crisis in the manner we need. One thinker who would probably have been somewhat sympathetic to BP is Karl Marx , surprising though that may seem. Marx understood market competition as what he termed a ""coercive law"", whereby individual companies are forced to act in certain ways because of their competitors' behaviour. Competition, he said, compels companies to maximise profits on pain of succumbing to stronger rivals - or, as in the case of BP, to activist shareholders such as Elliott Management. It stands to reason that BP has refocused on fossil fuels: oil and gas production is simply much more profitable than renewable energy. ""No capitalist,"" Marx wrote , ""ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be ... so long as it reduces the rate of profit."" He could just as well have been talking about the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The CEOs of firms such as Exxon have been telling financial markets exactly the same thing for years. Like it or not, BP doesn't have the luxury of saying: ""Oh, we'll do something less profitable but better for the planet."" Capitalism chews you up and spits you out if you do that. ""Shareholder value"" is not a consulting gimmick, or at least not only that; it is a very real disciplinary force. All of this, to be clear, is not to absolve BP of responsibility. Rather, it is to make a case about how we should understand the problems we face - that is, not as a problem of greedy individual firms, but a system rigged against positive change. ""The problem,"" the political economist Geoff Mann has written , ""is not that capitalism is a conspiracy of greedy people. The problem is that capitalism, as a way of organising our collective life, does its best to force us to be greedy - and if that is true, then finger-pointing at nasty CEOs and investment bankers may be morally satisfying, but fails to address the problem."" Substitute ""greedy firms"" for Mann's ""greedy people"", and this was exactly Marx's point about capitalism and its coercive powers. Private individuals do not make history under conditions of our own choosing, but neither do businesses. In short, the problem is not BP or indeed any other individual company. The problem is that BP and its fossil-fuel peers operate within a system that requires them to invest and operate in ways that are deleterious to the environment. In the half-decade after the 2015 UN climate change conference in Paris, European governments briefly talked a good game about taking actions - even up to the stranding of hydrocarbon assets - that might actually make fossil-fuel production less profitable in the medium and long term. Hence why BP, Shell and others then started making plans to transition into cleaner energy. They wanted to be ahead of the curve, or at any rate, not too far behind it. But since 2020, governments have shown that it was in fact just talk. Most notably, they have continued to issue licences for new oil and gas production at near-record rates, despite being told by experts that such licences are fundamentally incompatible with plans for net zero emissions; Norway alone has issued more than 100 new production licences since then. It is this miserable government appeasement that has emboldened BP and the rest to abandon their transition plans. Elliott, the activist shareholder in BP's case, merely forced the issue; putting Marx's ""coercive law"" into practice. It is entirely within the power and purview of governments to change this situation for the better; either by making fossil fuels less profitable, or by making renewables more profitable, or both. For example, robust carbon taxes would hobble fossil fuels, or more generous electricity tariffs would inflate returns on renewables. But what is economically straightforward on paper is politically fraught in practice: either of those courses of action would result in the one thing that sitting governments will never actively countenance, especially given the electoral experiences of recent years: namely, inflation. And so, for now at least, we appear to be stuck. Because it is the crucible of fossil-fuel extraction and combustion, the energy system is at the heart of the climate problem. For as long as it remains beholden to the profit motive, it's hard to see us resolving our predicament. In the summer of 2007, Citigroup's chief executive, Chuck Prince, explained why he was investing in sub-prime mortgages (just prior to them blowing up the global financial system): the sub-prime business was still profitable, and all his competitors were still in the game. ""As long as the music is playing,"" Prince said , ""you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing."" Two decades on, the music of the hydrocarbons is still playing, and BP is still dancing.",the Guardian,2025-03-03T17:10:01.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/bp-green-ambitions-climate-emergency-capitalism
"To the CEOs who’ve joined Trump’s fight against diversity, I say this: you’re making a big mistake","T he mask has slipped and the gloves are off. A company which in 2022 boasted that it had exceeded its target , ""spending $1.26 billion with US certified diverse suppliers"", is now ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. That company is Meta (formerly known as Facebook), whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced DEI dismantling shortly before he had a prominent seat at Donald Trump's recent inauguration. Perhaps from that privileged spot he was able to imbibe some of the ""masculine energy"" he says he wants to see at work. Meta is not alone in signalling a shift from its previous position. Amazon , McDonald's, Accenture , Google , General Motors, Pepsi, Walmart and Boeing are among the corporate giants who are downplaying or removing altogether references to DEI and public commitments to it. The consultancy Deloitte used to declare that ""diversity, equity and inclusion are core to our values"". But, the FT reports , the page those words appeared on has been wiped from its website . It is possible these decisions were taken partly on legal advice. Zuckerberg seems to have pre-empted the attorney general, Trump's Florida favourite Pam Bondi , as she recently declared that there should be an end to what she called ""illegal DEI"" and ""accessibility"" discrimination. You can imagine that in-house counsel had anticipated legal trouble and so were moved to suggest caution on DEI issues. Zuckerberg is not merely being cautious, however. He has moved Maxine Williams, former chief diversity officer , to a role concerned with ""accessibility and engagement"". Whether that restructuring will be enough to satisfy the Maga overlords remains to be seen. Some of the changes at other companies may be merely symbolic or presentational. And not everyone is backing down. The investment bank Goldman Sachs stated: ""We strongly believe that organisations benefit from diverse perspectives"" - although this belief has not stopped them from removing one of their former requirements for diversity in their clients. Goldman Sachs is still ""committed to operating our programmes and policies in compliance with the law"", it says. Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, dared anti-DEI activists to challenge his bank's pro-diversity stance. (But he is taking a hard line on forcing people to return to the office , despite remote working being key for modern diverse workforces.) All the same, the overriding effect of seeing that array of (newly) admiring CEOs lining up in Washington to salute the incoming chief was to recall the timeless Marxist dictum (Groucho, not Karl): ""Those are my principles and if you don't like them ... well, I have others."" Maybe the pressure has finally got to some of these top bosses. A recent article from senior partners at McKinsey noted that ""CEOs are on the job 24/7, responsible for addressing an ever-shifting array of problems and threats"". But perhaps part of the problem is feeding already narcissistic CEOs the sort of grandiose advice offered by the blue-chip consultants in their article. Likening the boss to an ""elite athlete"", the authors argue that CEOs need to use their time purposefully (like LeBron James, the basketball star), ""perfect the art of recovery"" (like the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo), keep learning (like the golfer Bryson DeChambeau), embrace data and analytics (like a Formula One grand prix driver) and be adaptable and resilient (like the gymnast Simone Biles and ... Muhammad Ali). The end product sounds like a remarkable person indeed: ""This is how leaders can ... build their resilience muscle, and become ... ready to thrive in the 21st century, while staying humble, celebrating noble failures, and always helping team members."" Yep, nobody I know, either. In fact, bosses risk being cut off from the everyday concerns of their staff. An academic study into this phenomenon looking back decades, published in the American Journal of Sociology and called The Great Separation, draws on evidence from a dozen countries. The highest earners inhabit the same narrow terrain, and have limited contact with lower earners, the researchers found. This can affect how elites engage with the rest of society, and how in turn lower earners see them. This ""great separation"" may have had an impact on ""the key social and political challenges of our time"", the study says. Brexit, Trump, populism and the rise of the new right may all be symptoms. Can the media do anything to help? The new media business Semafor has just launched a weekly newsletter called The CEO Signal, available (for free!) to bosses running companies with annual turnover of at least $500m (PS400m). Its editor, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, says there is a need for such a specially targeted publication : ""There's a place here in the market for something that's much more tightly focused to the people at the very top of the org chart - who are actually trying to run exceedingly complicated organisations, at an increasingly complicated time,"" he told the Press Gazette. ""And there's nobody in any organisation who faces the same list of challenges as the CEO does,"" he added. ""It's a cliche to say that it's lonely at the top, but there is something to that."" The venerable Harvard Business Review is also about to launch a new service specifically for the ""C-suite"" - that is, for people whose job title begins with the word ""chief"". How these new publications will help to mitigate some of the problems highlighted by the ""great separation"" study is not immediately clear. I am, however, reminded of what Laura Empson, a professor at Bayes Business School in London, has observed : that if a leader complains it is lonely at the top then they ""are not doing it right"". Rather than an ever-narrowing elite of CEOs becoming more and more detached from their workforce, we would do better to try to reconnect. Companies and workplaces should be vibrant and cohesive communities of people. The ghastly alternative could be seen at the White House last week, when Elon Musk cavorted around the Oval Office firing off wild and unsubstantiated accusations against public officials , while Trump looked on calmly. Musk confidently asserted, without offering any evidence, that some officials at the now gutted USAid had been taking ""kickbacks"". This is not model CEO behaviour. And this is not the leadership we need.",the Guardian,2025-02-18T10:00:03.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/18/ceo-donald-trump-anti-diversity-agenda-dei-initiatives-oval-office-workforce
"Trump might not know it, but he’s forging a new relationship between Britain and the EU","I t would be absurd to claim to see a silver lining behind every Donald Trump cloud. Those clouds are too many, too dark and too dangerous. All the same, viewed from a domestic political perspective, there is a clear emerging British upside to Trump's efforts at crashing the post-cold war order. It might even get a boost from Thursday's Washington visit by Keir Starmer. In July 2024, when Starmer became prime minister, Labour was rigidly on the defensive about Europe. Brexit was seen as an electorally unstable issue for a party whose priority was to reconnect with leave voters. Everything about Europe was thus sidelined during the election. Only vague generalities were permitted. The only foreign leaders pictured in the party manifesto were Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Canada's Justin Trudeau. Since July, Labour in government has continued to tread warily. Starmer's personal goodwill towards Europe was clear in international meetings, especially bilaterals. But he remained circumspect and nervous about re-engaging on policy specifics, especially with the EU itself. For instance, a report last week that the UK would agree with the EU on youth mobility visas was quickly knocked down by the government . Downing Street's response here was explicit. Such a scheme, even though only applying to 18- to 30-year-olds, restricted to a three-year limit and subject to an annual numbers cap, would be depicted as a resumption of pre-Brexit freedom of movement. It was not going to happen, said No 10. The reason is simple. Starmer is determined to prevent any replay of the Brexit years from entering the domestic political arena. The Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey's recent proposal for Britain to rejoin the European customs union also got a similarly immediate brush-off. Importantly, the Conservative opposition is also cautious about Europe , although for quite different reasons. Brexit still remains part of the Tory party's creed. But even some Tory true believers can see there's a problem. Brexit is synonymous in the public mind with the chaos of the Johnson, Truss and Sunak years, which led to the party's worst modern election defeat last year. Nor has Brexit delivered any of the advantages promised in 2016. The Tories are therefore content with the standoff too. Even Reform UK says little about Brexit. Only the Lib Dems and the Scottish nationalists feel unfettered by the issue. The politics of the UK-Europe relationship might have stayed quietly frozen there for the next two or three years, despite Trump's return. That was, after all, the original Labour government plan. So much has happened in Washington so quickly that it is perhaps hard to remember that, just after the 20 January inauguration, the UK was wholly focused on trying to embrace Trump as much as practicable, as well as on keeping out of the developing US-EU tariff battle. That changed for ever with Trump's volte-face on the Russia-Ukraine war. By embracing Russia, and trashing Ukraine and Zelenskyy , Trump exposed the true scale of the security threat to Ukraine and Europe that would result from a deal between him and Vladimir Putin. JD Vance underlined the realities in Munich shortly after. As a result, Trump drove Britain and Europe closer together far sooner than might have happened if Kamala Harris had become US president. Starmer now talks almost daily with Zelenskyy and, just as importantly, with Emmanuel Macron. This change is the product of necessity. It has been brought on by Trump's recklessness. But it has a positive side. It forces Starmer to engage far more actively with Europe on defence and security. This is desirable all round. One consequence was Tuesday's defence spending hike announcement. But this may be only the start. A further paradox is that Trump has also forced Kemi Badenoch and the Tory party to support Starmer's more Europe-oriented response. Having backed Ukraine so passionately under Boris Johnson from 2022, anything else would discredit the Conservatives further. Remarkably, the Tories have almost nothing to say about a shift that would have been anathema in Johnson's day. Even Nigel Farage, though less heavily politically invested in support for Ukraine and Zelenskyy, has had to join the slipstream. All of which has gifted Starmer a new and previously closed space in British politics. Building up Europe's defence effort is suddenly the patriotic course. In the past, it would have been depicted as divisive, anti-American and anti-Nato. Instead, with the US threatening to turn its back on Ukraine, Europe and even Nato, it is Trump who is now divisive. There is an echo here of modern Britain's Churchillian mythology, and of the words uttered by a defiant British soldier who raises his fist to the gathering storm in David Low's iconic 1940 cartoon: ""Very well, alone."" Now, though, it is all Europe, not Britain, that stands alone. Trump deserves two sorts of credit for this amid all the justified condemnation. First, because all of Europe should have seen and acted earlier on the security need anyway - not exactly difficult after Putin's seizure of Crimea and Trump's first term. Second, because it pushes Britain closer to Europe more generally. This increases the possibility for other forms of European joint action, not just in defence, that will sometimes be based on nation states and not exclusively on the disturbingly unwieldy EU. Last weekend's German election is potentially pivotal here. The likely German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has long been open both to stronger German defence and, like Macron, to what is known in EU-speak as ""variable geometry"" relationships. This is where the priority for Europe's future lies, not just for Britain. Whether these things will happen, and whether they will be sustained by the Merz-Starmer generation of leaders, are different questions altogether. But Trump has given Europe a chance. There is a gleam in the dark.",the Guardian,2025-02-27T06:00:28.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/donald-trump-britain-eu-relationship-ukraine-brexit
Hold your breath and look to Germany: its election could decide the fate of Europe – and the UK,"E ven in less stressed times, Britain always pays too much attention to the US and too little to Germany. In today's torrid circumstances, that imbalance is perhaps excusable. After all, Donald Trump , it now turns out, really means it. He is more interested in US plunder and profit from places like Gaza, Ukraine and Greenland than in upholding a just peace or good order. Even so, the inattention towards Germany needs to end. Britain's politicians, like German politicians, are rewiring their worldviews amid a political gale. But Germany, though no longer a great power, is nevertheless a great nation. Indeed, it may be more than ever the essential European nation now, after the Trump administration's very public trashing of the entire Atlantic alliance seemed to leave Europe to its own devices. The German general election , this coming Sunday, is an event with consequences. Primarily, of course, those consequences will be felt in Germany itself, with its extended economic stagnation, its anxieties about migration and borders, its traditional fears about borrowing, its nervousness about military commitments, and its sudden lurching anxiety that the US is ready to allow Russia to threaten the lands on its eastern frontier. Germany's inherent importance, though, means the election will also help determine whether Europe - not just the EU - is able to cope with Trump's second term. Will that Europe be able to deliver the defence and security to protect not merely Ukraine , a daunting enough task, but the Baltic republics, Poland and the other former Soviet satellite states too? Can it reform its faltering economic model? These are reverberations that Britain cannot avoid, even if it wants to. Needless to say, the German election has received only a fraction of the attention that this country's political class lavishes on a US election. Equally predictably, much of that very limited amount of attention is absorbed by a fixation - one that is shared to a degree by the German media - with the populist anti-immigrant Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party. As a result, however, the likely victor on Sunday, the centre-right CDU-CSU coalition under the probable next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has barely been scrutinised at all. This contest is occurring against a backdrop of economic failure, not success. The German economy shrank in 2023 and again in 2024. It seems likely to stay in recession again this year. It adds up to the longest period of economic stagnation since the fall of Hitler in 1945. Whoever emerges as chancellor after Sunday will face choices very similar to those confronting Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. The reasons for Germany's decline are not hard to understand. Germany's dependence on Russian energy meant prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine. Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition government, in power since 2021, has scaled back that dependence - renewables now produce 60% of German energy - but not eliminated it. German car exports have become more expensive, while China has surged ahead in the production of cheaper electric vehicles. A tariff war with the US now looms. All this has provided a system shock to a country still strongly conditioned by its craving for postwar stability. ""We have used up our old success, and not invested in new things,"" the commentator Theo Koll told the UK in a Changing Europe podcast this week. ""We have for a long time lived in a kind of 'Gore-Tex republic' ... we wanted it nice and cosy inside and all the unpleasant things had to be outside."" This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason. The rise of the AfD , amid the perception that irregular migration is out of control, is the single most visible sign that the old political era has ended. It has been quickened by violent killings where migrants are suspects during the election campaign in Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and, last week, Munich . The latest Politico poll of polls puts the AfD on 21%, double what it secured in the previous federal election in 2021, running second to the CDU-CSU on 29%, but ahead of Scholz's SPD on 16% and the Greens on 13%. By that token, though, a victory for Merz's CDU-CSU on 23 February would be genuinely significant. It would be significant even though 29% would be a decline from the 42% that the parties took under Angela Merkel in 2013. It would show, in Europe's heartland, that the line can be held against populism of the right. This is not a trivial lesson, especially after the debacle of the French assembly election last year. It would also be a vote of confidence, albeit a relatively weak one, for one of Europe's few remaining big parties of the centre right. Once-powerful parties like the French Gaullists can only look on with frustration and envy - to say nothing of Kemi Badenoch's Conservatives. Not least, it would also be a rebuke to those like Elon Musk and JD Vance who have actively promoted the AfD from abroad. Yet it would also pose two big questions. The first, and more immediate, would be the coalition that Merz would construct and the content of its programme. Everything here depends on which parties qualify for the Bundestag and on how many seats each wins. Merz has repeatedly ruled out governing with the AfD, so his main coalition partner could be Scholz's diminished SPD or, less likely in view of Merz's commitment to growth, the Greens. If the polls are right, however, whatever Merz comes up with is likely to be a weak coalition. This would give him relatively little leeway to drive reforms of the kind he advocates - familiar themes to UK readers, like benefit cuts, ending business red tape and raising defence spending. He is, though, open to loosening the constitutionally enshrined ""debt brake"", which is blocking much-needed public investment. It is likely to take until Easter before we know the full coalition picture. The other, intimately related, question would be about Germany's borders. Merz triggered huge protests when the AfD backed his bill allowing Germany to turn asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border. This prompted a rare rebuke from Merkel , that Merz had abandoned a historically resonant firewall against far-right support. Yet border controls matter for any state that seeks to ensure the security, including the social welfare, of its citizens, and Germany is not the only country where voters are demanding greater effectiveness. Sunday's election is a critical European moment, and would be even if Trump did not exist. The key question is not, at least at this stage, about the rise of the extreme right. It is about the continuing viability of the centre right, or the adaptability of what Merkel, from early in her career as party leader, dubbed ""the new social capitalism"". The current recession has put this vision to an unforgiving test. Merz will be judged by the outcome, if he wins power. It is a moment that matters for Germany - but also for us.",the Guardian,2025-02-20T08:00:32.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/20/germany-election-europe-uk-trump-afd-populism
Never mind the planet’s fate when the jet set feel the urge to seek out some winter sun,"T hat I fully expect to be dead by the time the UK achieves net zero is, of course, no reason to dodge interim advice from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the UK's official climate authority. Its latest report to government is of particular interest to the public, in arguing that a third of the emissions cuts required to achieve net zero by 2050 will have to come from consumers themselves. Unless we - individual households - accept heat pumps and electric cars and deterrents to flying and less meat (skipping two kebabs per week), the CCC explains, the target cannot be met. And assuming the introduction of a selective news blackout that reduces public awareness of UK plutocrats, celebrities and influencers with colossal carbon footprints, such a behavioural transformation may not be impossible. In the more likely event of continued media indulgence for the UK's highest-status emitters, sustained general cooperation may be more optimistic. For as long as, say, Carrie Johnson sees no reason not to disseminate images of her family's strenuous holidaymaking in distant places - last month Saudi Arabia - the much less frequent flyers being urged by the CCC to adapt to net zero will be exposed to powerfully contradictory, even compliance-crushing, messages. Including, in this case, that a ""dream"" stay in Saudi's St Regis Red Sea resort - accessible only by seaplane or speedboat - is compatible with a reputation as an environmentalist. Just a few years ago, Mrs Johnson was extremely exercised by single-use straws. Saudi Arabia's actions to combat climate change, to which it is exceptionally exposed, were recently rated as ""critically insufficient"" . To be fair, as Mrs Johnson pointed out, her husband was already in Saudi Arabia for what the couple call ""work"". As in, he was telling an audience that Saudi Arabia is ""a global leader in women's empowerment and innovation"". The CCC sets great store in its new report on comments from a small citizens' panel that heard from experts before it appraised different household interventions and their funding. According to its chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, these 26 people ""were often ahead of even our advice on some of the things they were willing to consider"". Without seeing the presentation, we can't know if it featured fairness, the carbon footprint from transport by the richest 0.1% that is 22 times that of a low earner , or if funding options featured the proposal of many prominent campaigners, notably Oxfam , that disproportionate emissions be reflected in policy or taxes. After a different panel, the UK-based Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change, convened a few years ago, Prof Peter Newell of Sussex University said: ""We have got to cut overconsumption and the best place to start is overconsumption among the polluting elites who contribute by far more than their share of carbon emissions."" The CCC records the panel's interest in subsidies to help poorer consumers survive the transition to heat pumps, but there is no sign that the 26 people considered ways of making the wealthiest emitters pay, let alone of making them, too, adapt. Aside from noting the panel's support for a frequent flyer levy (as an alternative to generally increased fares), the resulting CCC advice seems to perpetuate the latitude long extended to the drivers of SUVs and the owners of multiple homes, in suggesting that the behaviour of a polluting elite is situated somewhere beyond targeted penalties. Even so, as public understanding develops, more flamboyant polluters in this group may want to think harder about showing off their car collections, yachts, multiple homes, commutes to Dubai. As generous as it is of the Beckhams, for instance, to share photos of their family's scattered houses, travels and PS16m yacht , success in educating the public (on which the CCC proposals depend) on carbon emissions could raise the chances of this gifted family being perceived, above all, as creators of carbon emissions. Already, although it has yet to trouble his career in underpants, David Beckham has been identified as one of the highest-emission environmentalists on the planet. after newsletter promotion For the present, research indicates that the public still underestimates, to a degree hugely convenient to the richest groups, their contribution to global warming. The majority of respondents in a four-country study overestimated the carbon footprint of the poorest 50% , and underestimated those of the richest 10% and 1%. One of its authors, Dr Ramit Debnath, commented: ""These countries are very different, but we found the rich are pretty similar no matter where you go, and their concerns are different to the rest of society. There's a huge contrast between billionaires travelling by private jet while the rest of us drink with soggy paper straws: one of those activities has a big impact on an individual carbon footprint, and one doesn't."" Considering how little it attempts to challenge this agreeable state of affairs, the CCC's report surely deserved a warmer reception than it received from the high net worth community and its allies. At the Telegraph , for example, we find that, far from exulting that the advisers did not get it into their heads to extract funding from the worst polluting households, its correspondents are incensed by ""everything Labour's net zero advisers want you to give up"" and the prospect of state subsidies for low-income families switching to low-carbon technologies. Still less has there been recognition that for affluent high-emitters the early adoption of new low-carbon technology would put them among the first to benefit from reduced running costs that form part of the CCC's plan. The panel, we learn, ""viewed it as inevitable and acceptable that higher-income households often make bigger savings overall "". Meanwhile, their SUVs are safe, they don't eat kebabs or use trains, and carbon emissions remain, for the foreseeable, the most negligible of deterrents to a ""dream"" family trip to Saudi Arabia.

The UK has a history of coddling authoritarian leaders – now it’s happening again,"W hy is Westminster, supposedly one of the world's great centres of democratic moderation, so welcoming to far-right foreign governments? For more than a century, since the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini , authoritarians have often found allies, apologists or a deliberate absence of criticism in the Commons, despite our parliament's self-image as a historic enemy of fascism. One reason for this forgiving attitude is that foreign policy is a pragmatic business, and Britain has increasingly become a country that can't afford to make enemies. The Starmer government's determination to see no evil in the Trump administration can be partly explained in those terms. Yet other, darker and less-examined impulses have also shaped the behaviour of some of our MPs, ministers and political journalists towards rightwing autocrats - both those who have wielded absolute power and those who apparently would like to, such as Trump. These impulses reveal much about British politics and the frustrations, fears and fantasies of some of its practitioners and observers. To some jaded or impatient players of the Westminster game, the regimes of foreign strongmen - so far, female authoritarians have been far less common - are objects of fascination. They represent politics pursued by alluringly different means. At times such as now, when many voters are disillusioned with liberal democracy and its compromises, abandoned commitments and slow pace, autocrats can appear to be politicians who actually get things done. ""People ask me what difference new leadership will make,"" said Kemi Badenoch last week. ""Well, take a look at President Trump."" Admiration for his new administration is not confined to the Tories. Last month, Anna McShane of the New Britain Project, a thinktank which describes itself as ""progressive"", wrote on the pro-Labour website LabourList: ""Starmer must learn from Trump: act fast, prioritise visible change ... While his policies remain polarising, the effectiveness of this approach cannot be ignored."" For some on the British right, foreign autocrats also appeal if they appear to be leading a crusade against one of conservatism's global enemies. In 1927, Winston Churchill, then a Tory chancellor, met Mussolini in Rome, five years after the dictator had seized power and begun violently suppressing the left. At a press conference after the meeting, Churchill said: ""If I had been an Italian, I am sure that I should have been wholeheartedly with you ... in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism."" In the 1970s and 1980s, many Tories and British rightwing journalists similarly supported Augusto Pinochet's brutal military regime in Chile, as an anti-communist ally in the cold war. Nowadays, the British right's bogeyman is the supposed threat to western values from Islam and immigration. The ultra-aggressive approach of Trump to both, with his contempt for the law and the whole concept of multiculturalism, offers political cover and encouragement to Badenoch and Nigel Farage, as they take up ever-more illiberal positions. Trump's transgressive, seemingly all-powerful populism is the kind of politics they might dream of practising, were either of them to occupy Downing Street. His presidency also thrills the Tory press. ""Trump has an extraordinary knack for tapping into the frustrations of ... the respectable working class - the quiet, skilled or semi-skilled man paying for the food on the family table,"" wrote John MacLeod in the Daily Mail last year. That Trump, with his vast inherited wealth and endless personal scandals, can appeal to millions of voters with utterly different backgrounds and values is a conservative fantasy come true. Since the dawn of mass democracy, the right has been trying to make its elites politically palatable. In Britain a century ago, Mussolini also ""attracted the admiring attention of leading Conservative journals ... as well as several newspapers, notably the Daily Mail,"" wrote the historian of fascism Martin Pugh in his 2005 book Hurrah for the Blackshirts! As the paper's pro-fascist then owner, Lord Rothermere, put it: ""In my judgment, he [Mussolini] saved the whole western world."" Apparently successful autocrats reassure rightwing journalists and politicians that history can be shaped by individuals, as conservatives have always wanted. An autocrat's cult of personality also provides the media with constant stories and opportunities for character studies. Among the Italian dictator's British admirers, wrote Pugh, ""those who met him invariably depicted Mussolini as simple, charming, businesslike, not the bombastic and theatrical figure portrayed in leftwing demonology."" In January, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, described the new US president in a strikingly similar way. ""The Donald Trump I met,"" he told the BBC, ""was a man who had incredible grace, generosity, very keen to be a good host, very funny, very friendly, very warm about the UK, our royal family, Scotland ..."" Gone are the days when Lammy, as a less guarded Labour MP, called Trump a ""tyrant in a toupee"". One problem with Westminster's warmth towards autocrats, whether diplomatic or genuinely enthusiastic, is that it eases their way by making them seem more respectable - rather than influencing them to moderate their behaviour, as is often claimed. All the British deference towards Mussolini in the 1920s and early 1930s did not stop him from eventually forming a hostile alliance with Adolf Hitler. Similarly, the refusal of Labour and the Tories to label Trump an extremist who is subverting the US constitution enables the BBC and other mainstream media organisations to avoid calling him an extremist, too. Meanwhile, his escalating transgressions continue. Sooner or later, the far-right tide will recede in the US and elsewhere. Authoritarian populists are often poor at governing, as Trump showed in his first term. This time, his approval ratings - already very low for a new president by historic standards - have started to fall, as the drawbacks or impracticality of many of his policies have become clear to more people. When the authoritarians do lose power, their acceptance or encouragement by so many British journalists and politicians may be widely seen as a huge moral and strategic misjudgment, as it was after Italian and German fascism had been defeated in the second world war. But Westminster will probably quickly move on. We are a moderate country, after all.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T06:00:49.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/britain-politics-authoritarian-leaders-trump-mussolini
I’ve never been that sociable but thought it was because I’m an introvert. Then I learned I have a rare type of hearing loss,"Y es, I frequently asked people to repeat themselves. Yes, I had trouble hearing dialogue on TV. And I often wondered if people were aware that they mumbled. That wasn't the impetus to get my hearing checked though. What got me to the doctor was that I was having trouble eavesdropping at work. I was sure there had been a time when I could hear conversations that didn't concern me. Even though I had made the appointment, I figured it was sinus trouble or perhaps my ears needed syringing. But my GP said my ears were clear and didn't even mention my sinuses. Instead she did a simple hearing test that involved rustling some paper in one ear while whispering in another. She asked me to repeat what she had whispered and I think I replied: ""Did you say something?"" I left with a referral to an audiologist. As medical tests go, hearing checks are kind of fun. I was given headphones to put on, through which were played a series of words at loud, medium and whispery volumes. I had to repeat the words as I heard them. Another test involved pressing a button every time I heard a beep, also at different volumes and pitches and which seemed to come from different directions. There's some stuff with a tuning fork and the audiologist checked if I could hear through my skull. At the end of the test, which I was sure I had aced, the audiologist announced the results: mild to moderate mid-frequency hearing loss. Mid-frequency is where people speak so it explained why I wanted to shout at people, ""For God's sake, enunciate!"" Believe it or not, even though I had got to the point of getting a hearing test, the result blindsided me. I thought the diagnosis would be something temporary and easily treated. Although I was stunned, I managed to ask a few questions: What causes it? (It is congenital.) How much of my hearing have I lost? (About 30%.) Will it get worse? (Deterioration is slow.) Do I need hearing aids? (They would help but aren't essential at this stage.) I left the audiologist's clinic in a bit of a daze as I absorbed this unexpected news about myself. I Googled it when I got home and discovered I have one of the rarest types of hearing loss. It also has a cute nickname - ""cookie bite"" hearing loss (because the test results resemble a cookie with a bite taken out of it). It is there from birth but deteriorates noticeably in adulthood, with the average age of diagnosis being late 30s. I was 40. Hearing loss doesn't run in my family, so how I got it is a mystery. I thought being an introvert was why I have never been that sociable. But the news of hearing loss made me realise introversion wasn't the only reason. When I went to pubs or nightclubs, I wondered how everyone else chatted so easily. I couldn't hear conversation unless people shouted at me and I thought I had to shout back, which isn't at all enjoyable. If I'm somewhere with background noise, or the din of chatter, I have to concentrate hard to hear. I missed bits of dialogue in movies and TV, and I put that down to drama schools not teaching actors to speak clearly any more. Subtitles have been a revelation. I have been genuinely surprised at how much dialogue I have been missing (although these days people with perfectly good hearing also complain about inaudible dialogue because sound mixing isn't what it used to be). So the big question: hearing aids and do I need them ? My GP says it is something to consider in the future. Audiologists advise it would help now because I wouldn't have to work so hard to hear. I did trial some and immediately understood what the audiologists meant. Talking to people was easier. I have got used to the effort needed to hear people and the mental fatigue is real. Then there's the cost of hearing aids to factor into my decision. I had assumed the price might be about the same as a laptop or a mobile phone, maybe. I got an email advertising an exclusive offer on premium hearing aids. The regular price was discounted by $3,000. The new ""bargain"" price? $5,995. Yes, there are less expensive models but the type of hearing aid is partially determined by the type of hearing loss. Medicare subsidies are available only for pension recipients. So I'll be taking the advice of my GP and getting them later. Much later. Until then, please enunciate.",the Guardian,2025-03-03T03:21:31.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/ive-never-been-that-sociable-but-thought-it-was-because-im-an-introvert-then-i-learned-i-have-a-rare-type-of-hearing-loss
I ran Britain’s army. I know what it needs. Don’t cut aid to fund defence,"T he world is more dangerous today than at any time since the cold war. Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine, tensions in the Indo-Pacific , and instability in the Middle East demand that Britain steps up. Our armed forces must be properly funded to meet these threats, and increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP is a welcome and necessary move. But we need to go further and faster to meet the challenges we face. Britain's military capabilities must be strengthened to deter aggression, safeguard our interests and maintain a credible global presence. But cutting aid to fund it is a fundamental strategic error that risks making us weaker, not stronger. Funding one out of the money allocated to the other risks undermining the very security we are trying to ensure. Britain's security and influence on the world stage depend on a balanced approach - one that integrates our military strength with diplomacy and development. To wield power effectively, we need hard and soft power working hand in hand. Cutting development aid undermines our ability to stabilise fragile states, reduce the conditions for extremism and build alliances that enhance our security. Simply put, well-targeted aid prevents conflict and reduces the burden on our armed forces in the long run. As Gen James Mattis, the former US secretary of defence, famously put it : ""If you don't fund the state department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately."" That same logic applies to Britain. Every pound we cut from development aid today risks costing us far more in future military operations. Complacency kills - both in war and in strategic planning. The decision to reduce aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income in 2021 was already a mistake, weakening Britain's global standing and reducing our ability to shape international affairs. Now, slashing aid further to fund defence spending is not just shortsighted - it is dangerously counterproductive. Weak states become breeding grounds for terrorism, organised crime and mass migration crises. We need only look at Afghanistan, where reduced international engagement has allowed instability to flourish, with consequences for global security. Without well-targeted aid, instability in Africa and the Middle East will only worsen, leading to direct security threats for Britain and Europe. We are not only stealing from the world's poorest and most vulnerable, but we are also stealing from British taxpayers by investing in a policy that will ultimately cost us more. Moreover, the premise that aid and defence are in competition is a false one. In reality, they are two sides of the same coin. Well-targeted development assistance helps to stabilise fragile regions, preventing crises before they require military intervention. It is aid that helps to rebuild war-torn societies, counter radicalisation and reduce the refugee flows that destabilise Europe. Without this investment, Britain will face an increased terrorist threat, more humanitarian emergencies and greater pressure on our borders. By neglecting this crucial component of security, we are setting ourselves up for greater instability, which will require even more military spending in the long term. Furthermore, the burden on Britain's armed forces will only grow. If we cut aid, we will be forced to deploy military resources in areas where we could have mitigated instability through targeted development. History shows that intervention without stabilisation leads to drawn-out conflicts and increased casualties. The overstretch of our forces is already evident - our army is at its smallest size since the Napoleonic wars, our navy is struggling to maintain a credible global presence, and our air force is operating at capacity. If we do not take a comprehensive approach to security - one that includes aid as a core pillar - we risk overcommitting our forces and diminishing our overall defence capability. We should also consider the moral imperative. Britain has long prided itself on being a force for good in the world. Turning our backs on the most desperate people, those who rely on British aid for survival, is not just a strategic mistake, it is a failure of our values. But beyond the moral argument, this decision will make Britain less safe. Weak governance and economic collapse abroad lead to radicalisation and conflict, and no amount of military spending can fully address those threats once they take root. Britain has long been a leader in Europe, not just in defence but in diplomacy and development. In a world where the US is stepping back from underwriting European security, this is a moment for leadership. Leadership means making the right choices - not false ones. Increasing defence spending should not come at the expense of cutting the very tools that help prevent the need for military intervention in the first place. It is time for a rethink. If we are serious about security, we must recognise that diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities - they are complementary. A well-funded aid programme, alongside increased defence investment, will ensure that Britain remains a global leader - both in strength and in moral authority. We cannot afford to get this wrong. If the government is serious about taking defence spending to 3% in the next parliament, it would be better to break its own fiscal rules and either raise taxes or increase borrowing. We may all have to share in the cost of doing the right thing.

The Guardian view on Labour eyeing green cuts: they would undermine growth and climate goals,"I n October, the prime minister, chancellor and energy secretary pledged billions to kickstart the UK's first carbon capture projects - one of the biggest green spending promises of the parliament. By December, Ed Miliband was signing contracts , Sir Keir Starmer vowed to ""reignite our industrial heartlands"" and Rachel Reeves warned that without bold action, Britain would be stuck with low growth and falling living standards. More importantly, net zero targets wouldn't be met without removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Fast forward and the Treasury is, reportedly , preparing to scrap the PS22bn plan, after economic growth failed to materialise. What a difference a few weeks make. The change of heart is not about the technology - carbon capture and storage (CCS) is still as underdeveloped as it was in October, when ministers extolled its virtues. The government's climate advisers are unequivocal: net zero is impossible without CCS. But the economic circumstances have changed. Ms Reeves underestimated how slowly interest rates would fall, and the deep spending pressures left by Tory austerity. She also faces rising defence costs. Her rigid, self-imposed fiscal rules dictate that any higher-than-expected spending in one area must be offset by cuts elsewhere. Rather than such arbitrary constraints, Britain needs a transparent system that enables strategic investment. The good news is that the Climate Change Committee told the government last week that the net cost of cutting UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 to 100% below 1990 levels is now 73% lower than it previously thought in 2020. The bad news is that the transition would still require a net cost of around PS4bn a year, a little under 0.2% of GDP. With less fiscal headroom than forecast, Ms Reeves could close the gap through borrowing or with a modest wealth tax - but rejects both. That leaves an unpalatable choice: cuts to welfare, public services or growth-driving investment in housing, energy and transport. Diverting funds from capital projects to defence risks turning her growth agenda into the usual Tory mix of deregulation, austerity and national security. Greening Britain requires short-term expenditure for long-term gains. Reaching net zero requires upfront investment, but will lower consumer bills and reduce reliance on imported fuels, shielding the population against price shocks. Early, targeted spending is a cost-saving measure - delays lead to higher long-term spending due to climate-related disasters, economic disruption and energy price instability. While private investment will eventually play a dominant role, the climate committee makes it clear that public spending remains necessary in areas where market forces alone can't drive change fast enough. Labour must recognise the state's crucial role in the green transition. BP's retreat from renewables proves private firms can't be trusted to phase out fossil fuels. A Common Wealth report is clear: profit-driven companies prioritise extraction over climate action. In January, it argued public ownership is the only credible way to manage the PS43bn North Sea decommissioning costs while ensuring a just transition. While it must be carefully managed to avoid inefficiency, public control remains the best way to phase out fossil fuels fairly and smoothly. The UK can't rely on foreign supply chains for green tech, or corporate goodwill to deliver net zero. Without a serious state-led green strategy, Labour's plan risks falling short of the challenge Britain faces.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T17:25:13.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-labour-eyeing-green-cuts-they-would-undermine-growth-and-climate-goals
"Starmer has the backing of Britons to stand up to Trumpism. At the White House, he should do so","D ay by day another vast hole opens up beneath what was once solid. The man who is on course to become Germany's next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, once the most pro-US of leaders, has declared Nato in effect over. In his clear-eyed perception of Donald Trump's first month, 80 years of shared transatlantic values have fallen into that crater. The US ""doesn't care about the fate of Europe one way or another"" and Washington's actions have been ""no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen"" than Moscow's, he said. Now, Europe must defend itself. The moment smacks of that 1940 David Low cartoon of a British soldier standing on a rock in a stormy sea, shaking his fist as the Luftwaffe approach: ""Very well, alone"". But this time we Europeans are alone. JD Vance, the US vice-president, declared war on European values and traditions ; Europe's liberal ""enemies within"" are more dangerous in his eyes than Russia or China. Those spell-breaking words told Europeans that the US can never be trusted again; at any time, Americans may vote for a leader who betrays old allies, sharing no affinity with Europe's liberal democracies, international rights or laws. ""The west"" no longer exists as an entity bound by shared beliefs. Keir Starmer knows that every step he takes inside the White House on Thursday could set off some Trumpian explosive device. Emmanuel Macron will have already tested the ground (he arrived there today). The US president's wild unpredictability, whether by design, delusion or distraction, is a weapon in itself, and a wary Starmer is war-gaming it with his advisers. That ""bridge"" of a ""special relationship"" remains in No 10's official briefing lexicon, but by now it is wholly illusory. Starmer's task is to salvage the best possible agreements on Ukraine, tariffs and defence without wavering on what once were mutual principles. He has his red lines, echoed across Europe: ""No talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine"". No mafioso protection racket grabbing Ukraine's mineral wealth to pay off bogus debts. Reuters reports that unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy pays half a trillion dollars , the US will cut off Ukraine's access to Starlink, Elon Musk's satellite communications network, crippling the country's defences. In the face of such brutishness, Starmer is the right man: lawyerly, calm and diplomatic. He will not be riled into pointless verbal warfare. He brings Europe's pledges to spend more, and possibly the hubristic offer of the UK's new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, of a ""new economic partnership"" with the UK as a hub for US AI to ""Make our economies great again"". But everyone can see that Trump's ""reset"" with Vladimir Putin is irreconcilable with Nato. The alliance is dead if it fails to resist a Russian aggressor, a despot who murders opposition politicians , commits unspeakable war crimes , kidnaps thousands of Ukrainian children, with a declared intent to return Warsaw pact countries to its embrace. Trump is Russia's greatest asset. Starmer will avoid verbal spats with a champion spitter. Be bold, comes the best advice from Merz, warning Europe's leaders ""not to come to Washington as a dwarf"" or they ""will be treated as one"" . As Europe speedily circles the wagons, the UK finds its role will be vital, as Macron and Merz call for a joint nuclear shield to be provided by France and the UK, pivoting from US nuclear dependence. In a continent that is losing the security we relied on all our lives, trade disputes become a trivial quibble, Brexit an irrelevance. Merz is calling for Europe to come together in foreign, trade and security policy. Starmer ought to seize the chance, and abandon Labour's fears of Brexiters. With its colossal majority, Labour has nothing to fear in rallying the country around joint European defence as a necessary patriotic cause, leaving the Tories and Reform confounded. The public that welcomed Ukrainians rejects Trump's betrayal plans: 21% of people strongly support British soldiers being stationed in Ukraine as peacekeepers, and 37% of people ""somewhat"" support the idea. Only 21% are opposed to it. The idea of a European army would have been unthinkable during the Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, on trade, a majority of voters in every constituency thinks the government should prioritise trade with the EU over the US, even in Clacton, Nigel Farage's seat. Fifty-five per cent of Britons now say it was wrong to leave the EU, while just 11% call Brexit a success. There's no need to reopen those old wounds. A Europe united against new perils seems likely to loosen its rigid single market rules on trade, given that Britain would be contributing so much in mutual defence. As Britain strives to spend up to 3% compared with Germany's 1.5% defence spending, the doors to trade must surely open for the UK to regain some of the 4-5% of GDP it has lost since Brexit . The Brexiters now sound bizarrely out of tune. Last week, David Frost, who led the UK's negotiations with the EU, frantically tweeted : ""Labour are taking us back into the EU orbit by stealth and hoping you won't notice till it's too late. Don't let them get away with it."" Yet those days are done. Instead, all of Europe and the UK need defence eurobonds for all to borrow. If the opposition attacks the chancellor for breaking a borrowing pledge, Labour need only point to the frightening new world where Elon Musk sends warm congratulations not to Germany's new leader, but to the far-right AfD. There will be a White House press conference during Starmer's visit, a dangerous opportunity for Trump to say unspeakable things while leaving Starmer dumbstruck. If he's lost for words, he might remember those spoken by a particularly memorable British prime minister at a press conference with a US president in 2003. Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister in Love Actually , told the president, Billy Bob Thornton: ""I fear that this has become a bad relationship; a relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to Britain. We may be a small country, but we're a great one, too ... And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that."" The real world is not scripted by Richard Curtis for happy endings. Poking presidents in public is not politic, and Starmer is likely to offer Trump a carriage ride with King Charles. But he will have no trouble rousing voters to defend European and British values against Trumpism.",the Guardian,2025-02-24T17:44:45.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/24/keir-starmer-uphold-british-european-values-trump-white-house
"David Archer, let it go. Beavers are nature’s answer to our broken rivers","The first time I laid eyes on a beaver was a couple of years ago on the Devon farm of Derek Gow, the farmer turned rewilder, who brought the furry rodents back to the UK 30 years ago. It was magical. Sitting in the June dusk, the pink-and-purple sky was reflected in the still ponds of the beaver habitat. Suddenly, ripples emerged from the lodge and the head of a kit - a baby beaver - popped up from underwater. Watching this fascinating, and very cute, creature collect willow branches in its mouth was a heart-stopping moment; it felt like peeking into a secret world. This scene will, I hope, now become common across England, after the government announced on Friday that beavers can be legally released into the wild for the first time. The rodents were a common feature of our rivers until about 400 years ago, when they were hunted to extinction for their pelts and an oil they secrete. So this is a return of a creature that belongs here, and that we cruelly extinguished from our landscape. But it's a much more important moment than that. We have royally screwed up our rivers over the centuries, straightening them, divorcing them from flood plains and destroying the surrounding habitats. This causes increased flooding and makes it more difficult for nature to thrive. Beavers can heal this; they are known as ""keystone species"", which means their presence creates habitats for myriad other creatures, including fish, amphibians and insects. The habitats I've visited have been thronging with life, with clouds of dragonflies in the air and tiny froglets hopping around my feet. Why? Because beavers dig ponds and create complex wetland habitats around rivers. Studies have found that fish in beaver habitats are larger and more numerous and that the presence of beavers rapidly increases biodiversity. The UK is one of the most nature depleted places in the world and beavers can help fix this - for free. There has been a fierce debate about the reintroduction of beavers in England; it has even become a story line on The Archers . While some Ambridge residents have been lobbying for the return of the rodents, David Archer fears they will bring harm to his farm. It is true that there are those that don't want them back in the landscape. Fair enough in some cases, as the rodents can fell trees. You can spot the telltale signs that you're entering the world of the beaver by the nibbled boughs and discarded, half-munched willow branches. But farmers I have spoken to have managed to avert this with a cheap and easy solution of wrapping chicken wire around tree trunks at beaver height. The creatures don't like getting the metal caught between their teeth. Others fear the rodents will cause their land to flood, which is also a legitimate concern. In other European countries where they roam free, governments provide services where troublesome beavers are removed and placed somewhere more appropriate. This is likely to be the case here, too. So concerns about beavers in our nature-denuded landscape are understandable. We have wiped out so many of our native species that most of us have not encountered a wild mammal larger than a squirrel. But I believe the worries are largely unfounded, particularly if beaver releases are monitored and managed properly. after newsletter promotion Beavers alleviate flooding. Their dams are leaky, which means rivers flow much more steadily, and rainwater isn't dumped all at once into towns and villages. It moves at a much slower pace through a beaver system than an artificially straightened river. The beavers on the River Otter in Devon - one of our free-living populations - have managed to stop the village downstream from flooding. As changes in climate brings heavier rainfall, their flood reduction services will prove invaluable. In the Czech Republic , the government planned a flood prevention scheme involving a dam. But the beavers got there first, building their dam in the exact location planned by officials, and thus saving taxpayers PS1m. Beavers also help reduce the impact of drought. In the dry summer of 2022, when farmers were struggling to grow grass for livestock and plant crops, a lucky few in Devon and Cornwall, where there are beavers, did not face the same problems. Drone footage shows parched, beaver-less land next to lush, green, beaver habitats. How? Because the ponds they dig hold water in the landscape, water that can then be used when rain is scarce. We are likely to have more frequent droughts due to climate breakdown, so beavers will be able to help prevent the worst effects of these. Currently, England's beavers are mostly in enclosures, where they have been released by conservationists who have been observing the impact they have in a few constrained acres. Some, which have either escaped from these enclosures or been released by guerrilla rewilders, are living wild on rivers mostly in the south. This moment has been decades in the making. Ever since Gow and his fellow rewilders concocted their plan in the 90s, the momentum has built. Successive environment departments have tried to legalise the release of beavers, but have been blocked because of fears it will upset farmers and certain wealthy landowners. Almost every year, conservationists have been told it is almost time to tear down the fences of enclosures and set beavers loose to fix our rivers, only to be informed the scheme has once again been delayed. Some frustrated conservationists have taken the law into their own hands, driving around the country with beavers in the back of a van, conducting ""beaver bombings"", where, unauthorised, they release a pair at a river and drive off again. It is faintly absurd that normally law-abiding nature lovers have felt forced to conduct clandestine beaver operations. But this won't be necessary any longer. These industrious rodents will, in the coming weeks, be living free all over the country, with the first expected to be released by the National Trust at Purbeck Heaths in Dorset. I urge you to go and visit, so you too can experience the magic of watching wild beavers.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T07:00:02.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/david-archer-beavers-broken-rivers
The left keeps getting identity politics wrong – and the right is benefiting from that,"T here are many things to be grateful to the musician Sam Fender for: reviving socially conscious songwriting, highlighting the brutality of austerity and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza before it was politically convenient. But, selfishly, the most important thing he's done is take my spot of being yelled at on the internet. In a recent interview with the Sunday Times, Fender took aim at the prominence of identity politics compared to class. ""We are very good at talking about privileges - white, male or straight privilege. We rarely talk about class, though,"" he said. ""And that's a lot of the reason that all the young lads are seduced by demagogues and psychos like Andrew Tate ... People preach to some kid in a pit town in Durham who's got fuck all and tell him he's privileged? Then Tate tells him he's worth something? It's seductive."" Why, for some people, has this proved controversial? Online backlash has included accusations that Fender is wrongly pitting minorities against the working class, that he's justifying misogyny as a response to deprivation, and that he's arguing against a phantom - no one is actually preaching to kids in pit towns that they've got white privilege. Some of these criticisms are fair: it's not just white working-class boys from the north who are drawn to Tate, but kids of colour in inner-city London as well. But Fender has identified something true. We've witnessed the rise of a kind of identity politics that sidelines class. And the far right is benefiting from it. Though the working class is not homogenous (shocker - it includes all kinds of ethnic and gender minorities!), identity politics has somehow been peeled off as a separate concern. Representing the interests of one is often seen as in conflict with doing the same for the other. The polling is stark - research from the Financial Times shows that at the same time that there was an increase in people thinking that the Democrats stand up for marginalised people (ie identity minorities), there was a plummet in those who thought they stand up for the working class. In no small part, this is down to the right mobilising a kind of identity politics of their own: in talking about the white working class, anger about economic inequalities is redirected into racial grievance. It's not wealth taxes, investment in education, or strengthening collective bargaining that will help the white working class: it's getting minorities to shut up about injustice. But it's also the case that the language of straight/white/male/cisgender privilege makes little room for the experiences of white men from working-class backgrounds. It sometimes seems like the only visibility for those who happen to be white, male and straight in the world of modern identity politics is as villains (see, the ""men are trash"" brand of Instagram feminism), or ""allies"" in political movements led by identity minorities. It's not like these discourses come with an asterisk to signal that they don't mean working-class men. It's worth pointing out that you're much less likely to encounter privilege preaching, of the kind Fender identifies, in trade unions, housing and renters' campaigns or the Palestine solidarity movement - where people are a) organised, b) focused on material harms, and c) not interacting with each other through the distorting prism of social media. But we live in a time when membership of political parties and trade unions has been in decline for decades. What we encounter on the internet is, for most people, the main way we engage with politics. The weakening of collective politics is no accident; it's by design. As Margaret Thatcher once said : ""Economics are the method; the object is to change the heart and soul."" Our economic circumstances profoundly alter how we think and feel about ourselves. Tories never had a problem with class inequality. It was class consciousness that they wanted to destroy. Forty five years of aggressive neoliberal policymaking - breaking the back of the trade union movement, selling off council housing, and smashing industrial labour to bits - was intended to take a sledgehammer to the societal engines of collective action and solidarity. What's been left behind is a patchwork of disconnected identities, unmoored from any sense of shared material conditions. These disconnected groups now compete for validation of their struggles, which is often expressed through online animosity. Attention has always been a psychological wage; to be recognised by other people is to be told that you matter. But social media has turned that natural, human need for attention into a trap. Silicon Valley created a literal attention economy, whereby eyeballs are converted into ad revenue and delicious data ripe for harvesting. Feeling insecure and lonely drives us on to Instagram, TikTok and dating apps; such platforms intensify those emotions to keep us there for as long as possible. Other users are our rivals. We're competing with each other for followers, clout, status and a central position in the public conversation. What does this mean for politics? It means that, rather than looking at people who aren't like us as potential opportunities for coalition-building, we perceive them as threats. There has been a tendency to spend too much time ruminating on our own feelings. Whether it's claiming all-white yoga classes are ""traumatising"" for people of colour , or insisting that a climate activist doing a choice bit of swearing brings ""violence"" into a space, or David Baddiel accusing an Arab-Australian poet of having erased and trampled on Jesus' Jewishness for saying he looks like family , modern identity politics has set a comically low threshold for harm. Competing in the attention economy incentivises us to turn molehills into mountains, and the cult of lived experience makes it hard to question proclamations of victimhood. The ""I"" has taken over identity politics: instead of striving for liberation from discrimination and material oppression, we just want to inflate the visibility value that's attached to suffering. The retreat into subjective experience primes us for the politics of resentment, competitive grievance and weaponised victimhood. While the personal is political, the self is a dead-end if what you want is social change. It's worth remembering the lesson of Narcissus: being too interested in your own reflection will kill you.",the Guardian,2025-03-03T08:00:42.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/identity-politics-the-left-the-right-liberation-victimhood
Is Europe misunderstanding Trump on Ukraine?,"A high-stakes transatlantic miscommunication is unfolding, with the potential to produce far worse consequences than the Oval Office contretemps between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the past month, the Trump administration has delivered several strong and sometimes conflicting messages to America's allies and partners in Europe . Discerning the signal in the noise isn't easy, but amid the zigs, zags and bombast, the new administration appears to be taking a position that Ukrainian and European leaders aren't hearing - or are trying to alter. The crux of the message seems to be this: the US will either broker an end to the war in Ukraine in short order or remove itself from the conflict, unless perhaps it deems Russia to have obstructed a ceasefire. (As Trump told Zelenskyy on Friday: ""You're either going to make a deal or we're out."") Washington will also refuse to make any commitment to Ukraine's postwar security, such as Nato membership, that would run a major risk of drawing the US into direct war with Russia - ""world war three,"" as Trump sees it - if Russia invades Ukraine again. The US has the sovereign right to adopt this stance, for the sake of its own interests, which include limiting the costs and risks the US is bearing for European defense. So Europe cannot dissuade the US, but it can work with Washington to achieve US goals while finding the best possible arrangement to protect Ukraine , secure Europe, and preserve Nato. European leaders, however, are hearing a different message - or two, to be precise. One version is maximally pessimistic: Europeans fear that Trump is aligning with Vladimir Putin and preparing to abandon Ukraine and perhaps several more countries besides. Such an outcome remains possible. So far, however, it has not come to pass. An initial meeting to reopen diplomatic relations with Russia , and a disturbingly staunch unwillingness to condemn Putin's aggression in Ukraine, are significant moves but are a long way from effectuating a grand geopolitical shift. The other version is far more optimistic: European leaders still hope to convince Trump to make a major US security guarantee to Ukraine. This effort drove British, French and Ukrainian leaders to visit the White House last week. In public remarks, all three attempted to sell Trump on providing a US ""backstop"" for a European military force, involving perhaps some 30,000 troops, to be placed in Ukraine once the fighting stops. Trump did not rule out some sort of US support for a European military contingent, but he indicated little willingness to put much American muscle behind it. ""I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,"" Trump said . ""We're going to have Europe do that."" On Friday, in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy contested Trump's stance. The Ukrainian president stated flatly : ""We will never accept just [a] ceasefire. It will not work without security guarantees."" Zelenskyy maintained that strong security guarantees had to come from the US, not just Europe. A European military force, he said, would not work unless the US provided a significant backstop: ""They need USA."" In short, Zelenskyy insisted he would not agree to a ceasefire, because Russia would not honor it, unless the US provided precisely what Trump had seemingly already ruled out. As the conversation devolved, Trump eventually threatened to withdraw US aid to Ukraine altogether if Zelenskyy's position did not change. Since then, Zelenskyy hasn't budged. To the contrary, he doubled down. ""If we cannot be accepted to Nato,"" Zelenskyy wrote in a statement , ""we need some clear structure of security guarantees from our allies in the US."" Only after such guarantees were on offer would Ukraine proceed with diplomacy to settle the war. European leaders promptly affirmed Zelenskyy's view. Following a meeting of 18 leaders on Sunday, Keir Starmer announced that a European ""coalition of the willing"" was prepared to station a military force in Ukraine to guarantee the peace. He pledged to put British ""boots on the ground and planes in the air"" - on one condition: ""this effort must have strong US backing"". For years now, officials and experts across the Atlantic have debated the merits of providing security guarantees to Ukraine. But the practical reality is that the Trump administration is not inclined to do so, not if it would obligate, de jure or de facto, the US to go to war on Ukraine's behalf in the future. That this is the position of the president of the United States should be understandable. None of Trump's predecessors ever made a commitment to fight for Ukraine. Joe Biden explicitly ruled out sending US troops when he saw Russia's full-scale invasion coming. Nor have any Nato allies come to Ukraine's direct defense. The reason is obvious: it would mean war with Russia, a prospect that Nato allies can still deter regardless of what happens in Ukraine. If Ukraine and Europe continue to push for strong US security guarantees, they have a small chance of succeeding and a larger chance of creating a permanent rupture with Trump. The president could conclude that his allies refuse to listen and, worse, keep trying to entrap him. Throwing up his hands, he could take the very actions that Ukraine and Europe most want to avoid: cutting off all US support for Ukraine and making a dirty deal with Putin. The damage could extend throughout Europe if Trump removes US military forces and assets from the region. Can this worst-case scenario be avoided? A route is still available. The sooner Ukraine and Europe stop fixating on a US security guarantee, the sooner they can coalesce - with the United States - around a viable plan that contains two main provisions. First, postwar Ukraine would maintain a large and technologically advanced military, trained and supplied by its western partners. Second, the US and Europe would commit to arm Ukraine heavily if Russia invaded again. Because they are doing so now, this commitment would be highly credible, unlike a heroic pledge to wage war on Ukraine's behalf. Nato allies could also sign a legally binding document and stockpile specific weapons systems that could be surged to Ukraine in case of a renewed attack. This formula may fall short of what Ukrainians want, but it may provide what they need. After all, Ukraine's own forces have protected the country in the current conflict, preserving 80% of Ukrainian territory and forcing Russia into a costly war of attrition. If those forces remain strong, it would hardly be a foregone conclusion that Putin or his successor will make another attempt - not because the Kremlin can be trusted to keep its word but because it would suffer enormous losses for little gain. Ukraine, Europe and the US must use their leverage at the negotiating table to get Russia to stop fighting without requiring Ukraine to disarm. Russia might acquiesce, having kept Ukraine out of Nato and Nato, and its members' forces, out of Ukraine. To reach a deal, however, the transatlantic community should come together, post haste, and throw its weight behind a common demand. To do otherwise is to court disaster not only for Ukraine but for European security as a whole.",the Guardian,2025-03-03T08:00:40.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/europe-trump-ukraine
A humiliation at the White House and what does it tell us? Trump would make a colony of my country,"I t's warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia - nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected with Donald Trump and the change in US policy towards Ukraine. Clarity emerged at today's macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time, air raid sirens were sounding in northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone. What proceeded, in front of TV cameras, was chilling, extraordinary. Zelenskyy grave, angry, desperate - as befits a leader being obliged to bargain away his nation's birthright. Trump claiming to be the honest broker, saying: ""I am not aligned with anybody. I am aligned with the world."" Be thankful, he tells a man who has seen his people murdered, his territory captured and besieged. ""Make a deal or we're out."" It got worse. Zelenskyy showed him photos of war atrocities. ""I think President Trump is on our side,"" he said, with no genuine hope and certainly no expectation that that was true. The vice-president, JD Vance, attacked Zelenskyy for being disrespectful. Both Trump and Vance verbally pummelled him for the cameras, for this is the art of the deal now: loaded, hectoring, callous, bloodless. But then Ukrainians' belief in a concrete proposal from Trump to end the war had already been replaced by the conviction that the president had no such plan, but rather, many different ideas about US involvement in the region - ideas that often relate to Ukraine , but sometimes conflict with each other and are never focused on supporting a country that is a victim of Russian aggression. During the past two weeks, we have watched as the issue of ending the Russian-Ukrainian war has transformed into the issue of rare earth metal mining in our country. As it turned out, in Saudi Arabia the participants in the Russian-US negotiations also discussed the extraction of rare earth metals, only they focused on resources in Russian territories and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. These rare earth metals have pushed the topic of the war and military aid to Ukraine out of the media space. That space is filled with dollars now. Older Ukrainians, who grew up in the Soviet Union, have recognised in this situation the US that was depicted by Soviet propaganda cartoons as a nation of greedy, irresponsible, grab-what-you-can capitalists, who spat on complex problems and had eyes only for dollar superprofits. This is an existential war, and a new reality. Trump says Zelenskyy is ""not ready for peace"", but Ukraine has no choice but to fight on, whatever the cost. Aid that was previously given for nothing must now be bought. If there is no money, then it is necessary to pay with resources. After three years of full-scale Russian aggression, US geopolitical interests in Ukraine have been replaced by financial interests. Instead of the politician President Biden, the businessman President Trump has entered the arena. Note that the US proposal on the extraction of rare earth metals in Ukraine, if realised, would allow the US side to sign a similar agreement with Russia and start digging without waiting for the end of hostilities. The notion is an ""investment fund"", managed by the US and Ukraine on ""equal terms"", into which Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas ""to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine"". Trump insists it is ""very fair"". Would such an agreement encourage Russia to cease its aggression? No! Does it contain security guarantees for Ukraine? It seems not. Does Ukraine have any choice? Debatable. In this situation, Britain and the EU become much more important partners for Ukraine than before. While organising favourable access to Ukrainian resources for the US, Trump hopes to hand over to Europe and Britain responsibility for Ukraine's security in the event of a cessation of hostilities, and responsibility for further military assistance. Given this, it is by no means clear what advantage such an agreement on rare earth metals would give Ukraine. Trump's claims that US mining on Ukrainian territory will be a sufficient guarantee of Ukraine's security because Russia will not risk attacking US economic interests do not stand up to criticism. The Chinese state-owned COFCO corporation invested in a new grain and oil handling complex in Ukraine's Mykolaiv port, but Chinese involvement did not protect the port from being targeted by Russian missiles . It has not been operational since March 2022 and the region is losing about 40% of its revenues. The fact that Trump has been so complimentary about Vladimir Putin , and so hostile to Zelenskyy, says everything. ""I think he will keep his word,"" Trump assured the world. ""I have known him for a long time."" Trump's phrase that peace will be achieved ""fairly soon or it won't happen at all"" indicates that he will not waste too much time on negotiations with Putin if they drag on, or if Putin puts forward conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine. Some conditions have already been announced by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who reminded us that Russia still plans to seize the entirety of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Zelenskyy was brave, but we are supplicants now. Trump and the Kremlin have made it abundantly clear that Ukraine's participation in these negotiations between the US and Russia is not necessary or desirable. Like so much else, the principle announced by Biden , ""Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"", has been trampled underfoot. Zelenskyy was called to the White House to sign, but not speak. Trump has had his way. He has transformed Ukraine from a subject into an object, and after this White House humiliation some Ukrainians are convinced that the extraction of rare earth metals on Trump's terms would turn our country into a ""colony"" of the US. Still, many Ukrainians would prefer to live in a US colony than in a Russian one, if that's the choice.

We asked the people of Gaza how they saw their future – this is what we found,"A fter coming the closest yet to falling apart, the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is back on its fragile track. Just days ago, an escalating dispute threatened the deal after both sides expressed frustration about the other's fulfilment of their respective obligations. Donald Trump's recent proposal to resettle Gaza's population of two million Palestinians also rattled the truce. The turbulences of the month-old ceasefire expose a deeper political uncertainty: after 15 months of fighting, no clear vision exists for what comes next. Who should govern and rebuild Gaza? What will its future relationship with Israel be? To navigate these questions, listening to ordinary people's perspectives is crucial. As behavioural scientists based at the London School of Economics, Jeremy Ginges and I conducted a large-scale study of how Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis view each other, and the future. Just days before the ceasefire was announced in January, we surveyed more than 1,400 people in nationally representative samples. Ongoing access restrictions and the conflict mean that public opinion in Gaza is rarely discussed. Our data collection there was part of in-person interviews led by Artis International and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR) with its existing polling infrastructure. Additionally, we spoke to several Palestinians in Gaza during the ceasefire's first phase via online phone calls several weeks ago. One of the most striking findings in our research is how a deep psychological asymmetry between each side's perceptions of the conflict has entrenched divisions. In Gaza, despite 16 months of devastating conflict and displacement - in the cases of some of those we polled as many as 10 times - political convictions were prioritised by many Palestinians, even over immediate personal safety. Respondents were asked to indicate how much they considered different values as part of their personal identity. Israelis hold more firmly now to their national identity compared to data we collected in May 2024, and a large majority of people in Gaza now indicate strong commitment to being Palestinian (94%), achieving national sovereignty (86%), and the right of refugees to return to their ancestral towns and villages lost during Israel's creation in 1948 (90%). A smaller group, but still more than a quarter, even saw these values as completely central to their identity, a predictor of extreme sacrifice and violence, as Scott Atran and Angel Gomez write . About one in four people in Gaza fully identified with maximalist ideas of sharia law and hard opposition to peace with Israel. As fewer Palestinians in Gaza consider the war the most pressing challenge for Palestinians, a trend shown by a recent PSR poll , other political identities are coming back to the fore. To better understand the current perspective of Palestinians in Gaza , we examined their interpretation of the conflict so far. We asked why members of their own group supported violence during the war and why they believed the other side did. A striking pattern emerged: both Israelis and Palestinians attributed their own side's attacks to ""ingroup love"" (concern and protection for their people) more than to ""outgroup hate"" (a desire to harm the other side). However, both groups believed that the other side was motivated more by hatred. This perception gap matters. Research shows that when people believe they are hated by another group, they become less inclined to support diplomatic solutions. Our data confirms this. When it comes to long-term political futures in Gaza, slightly less than half (48%) of Palestinians remain supportive of some form of a two-state solution. Others said the more realistic scenarios for ending the conflict involve the displacement of Jews from the region (20%), or the establishment of one state under strict sharia law (27%), in which Jews would have fewer rights. Only 5% believed in a one-state solution with coexistence under equal rights. But how - and with whom as leaders - do people in Gaza envision achieving their goals? Hamas , which has ruled the territory since 2007 and is rooted in the idea of an Islamic Palestinian nation, may seem the natural contender. But according to PSR polls, support for Hamas has decreased from 42% shortly after 7 October 2023 to only 21% in January 2025. In fact, as Hamas's wartime performance is increasingly criticised, fewer people in Gaza see it winning or support attacks against Israel. Together with many Palestinians preferring more reconciliatory visions in the first place, this is good news for peace efforts. And yet, if elections were held, many Palestinians say they would still vote for Hamas. The reason? No viable alternative has seized on Hamas's decline. Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank and dominant force in the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), is widely considered weak and illegitimate, as people in our research confirmed. Once again, perceptions of outgroup hate significantly lowered approval of the PLO, which stands for a more diplomatic approach towards Israel. Other political figures have gained popularity, but no movement has coalesced around them. Instead, the 32% of Palestinians who say their interests are entirely unrepresented by all available options now form the largest constituency in Gaza. With no clear leadership, Gaza's post-war future remains undecided. There is reason to hope, however. For one, more than 90% of the people in Gaza are optimistic about long-term prospects for an armistice or peace. Perceptions about outgroup hate can change over time, as our data indicates, or be corrected, according to experimental studies . Although difficult, this could boost support for diplomacy and reconciliation. As for concrete policies, the people we polled in Gaza are increasingly open to some alternatives, such as a temporary security presence and reconstruction facilitated by Egypt . After nearly sliding back into war, Israel and Hamas now enter a fragile new round of ceasefire negotiations. But the real challenge is finding leaders on both sides who can not only represent their people's political interests, but also bridge the psychological divide that obstructs lasting peace.

Mirroring the far right on immigration backfired for Germany’s political centre,"G ermany's next government will be a coalition of the political centre led by the conservative Friedrich Merz . That may sound like stability. Traditionally, a government made up of the two big centrist parties, the Social Democrats (SPD) and Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU), has been called the grand coalition. But it is no longer grand and offers only an illusion of stability. The SPD achieved its worst result in a national election since the second world war, with 16.4% of the vote. The CDU scored its second-worst result, with 28.5%. If you include the Greens and the Liberals, the parties that occupy the political ground from centre-left to centre-right won just over 60% of the votes cast. At the same time, the fringes are getting stronger. However, the poles of the political spectrum are unequal in two respects. First, the far-right AfD achieved its strongest result ever (20.8%), while the Left party (Die Linke) is celebrating a comeback but, with 8.8% of the vote, it is not even half as strong as the AfD. The second difference: despite its rejection of Nato and the supply of further weapons to Ukraine, the Left is not as extreme as the AfD. The AfD's gains have come from all sides: it gained more than a million conservative votes, 720,000 from the SPD and 890,000 from the Liberals. In other words, the rise of the far right is an inglorious joint effort by the conservatives and the previous SPD-led government. The SPD in effect allowed the AfD to become the strongest party among workers for the first time: 38% of German workers voted for the far right, while only 12% voted for the SPD. And even though the AfD was significantly stronger in eastern Germany (36%) than in west Germany (18%) overall, there was an alignment between east and west among working-class voters. The AfD's strongholds in the west are regions that are experiencing industrial structural change such as parts of the Ruhr area, Baden-Wurttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. This transition affects, in a broad sense, all energy-intensive industries such as the old coal sector and the car and chemical industries. All of these sectors are being converted to climate neutrality. The German Economic Institute has identified a regional correlation between a strong AfD and industries undergoing transformation. The climate transition triggers immense economic fears, and the SPD (and the Greens) have so far failed to allay them with a hopeful agenda. The strengthening of the AfD by the conservatives, however, follows a familiar pattern: the CDU has hardened its rhetoric and position on migration, bringing it closer to the AfD's policies. Merz lifted the AfD to the zenith of its influence in the run-up to the election by forming a parliamentary majority with it for the first time on a symbolic resolution on migration. Without doubt, there is an urgent need for action on migration: several deadly attacks in which the suspects were asylum seekers demonstrated this in a horrific way shortly before the election. But the solutions do not lie in a rapprochement with the positions of the AfD, which are not only anti-European and likely to fall foul of Germany's legal obligations, but would also stifle immigration needed to sustain Germany's labour market. The AfD is strongest in regions where residents encounter the fewest foreigners. Migrants are scapegoats for most AfD voters, partly because of xenophobia, but partly because the party succeeds in turning economic fears into cultural anger. The radically hardened discourse on migration also helped the Left party to mobilise votes. However, it was ultimately the Greens that made this leftwing success possible. Robert Habeck, the Greens' candidate for chancellor, presented his own migration plan containing measures unusually harsh for progressives. He was appealing to conservative voters, but they were hardly likely to vote Green. Instead, Habeck opened up a space to the left of his party. Yes, the Left also addressed bread-and-butter issues such as high rents and food prices, but it lacked any truly innovative proposals, which is why it is not really the new hope for the progressive camp. Nevertheless, the Left drew many voters away from the Greens. The AfD is not unhappy with its new role as the biggest opposition party, because it is focused on its "" Project 2029 "". Unlike Project 2025, a 900-page blueprint for dismantling and disrupting the US government by a rightwing thinktank, this is less a plan for a coup d'etat from within, but a strategy for gaining power. The AfD's calculation: in a coalition with the SPD, the CDU will have to make painful compromises, which should lead to even more conservative voters switching to the AfD. If this happens, it could become the strongest force in the next election, expected in 2029. Whether that switch actually occurs is entirely in the hands of the new government. Steady growth of the AfD is not a foregone conclusion. The new government must do a number of things: first, the CDU must abandon its attempt to weaken the AfD by speaking like the AfD. Instead, it must develop a modern conservative agenda for migration and the economy, as well as Europe's defence and support for Ukraine. Second, the SPD and CDU must not slow down the drive to modernise industry through climate action. Instead, the social anxieties of the middle and working classes must be addressed by creating clear prospects for jobs and regions. Third, the new government must restore trust in mainstream politics by exemplifying a new culture of cooperation in the centre. According to the research institute Infratest dimap, 70% of German voters do not want the AfD to govern. This majority needs to be reassured; it needs to be addressed emotionally and empathetically. If the new government takes such principles to heart, the AfD's plan could quickly turn out to be hubris. In fact, what is really needed after this election is a Project 2029 in the progressive camp. Compelling ideas for a fair and climate-neutral society in a strong Europe were missing in this election campaign. The SPD will hardly be able to achieve a substantial renewal while governing with the CDU. Progressive renewal in Germany must come now from the Greens, who have the freedom to do so in opposition. Their central task will be not to follow a rightwing mainstream, but to translate progressive positions into better solutions and make them mainstream.",the Guardian,2025-02-28T07:00:52.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/migration-german-election-political-centre
Extremists would not need to create an authoritarian state in Britain: Starmer is doing that for them,"I f the Trump project implodes, it might take with it the extreme and far-right European parties to which it is umbilically connected. Like all such parties, the hard-right Reform UK poses as patriotic while grovelling to foreign interests, and this could be its undoing. But we cannot bank on it. The UK government must do all it can to prevent the disaster that has befallen several other European nations. If it fails to meet people's needs and keeps echoing far-right talking points , we could go the same way as Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Finland, Sweden and Austria. As well as working more effectively to keep Reform out of office, the government should ensure that, if the worst happens and Nigel Farage and his Death Eaters win in 2029, the foundations of an authoritarian state have not already been laid for them. But here too Labour seems perversely determined to prepare the ground for its traditional opponents. Here are three of the consistent features of authoritarian states: the extreme persecution of dissent, the use of parajudicial measures to shut down opposition movements, and the selective application of the law. All three are already widely deployed in the UK. Though they were introduced in their current form by the Tories, they have been sustained and defended by Keir Starmer's party. What this means is that if a hard- or far-right government starts doing what they always do - persecuting minorities and opponents, ripping into public services and the enabling state - and if good citizens take to the streets to defend the people and institutions under attack, the government will be able to round them up and throw them in prison, without the need for a single new law or statute. It will also be able to license blatant disregard for the law by its own supporters, without breaking existing patterns of policing. And Labour will be unable to say a word against any of it, because all this has been happening on its own watch. Let's examine these three elements, and how they are already embedded. Two groups in particular are now subject to the kind of legal sanctions and oppressive policing more familiar in countries like Russia and Belarus: environmental and pro-Palestine protesters. Using a combination of older legislation and remarkable new powers in the 2022 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and the 2023 Public Order Act , the police have been able to shut down any demonstration that they, the government or the media deem unwelcome. The measures and penalties are extraordinary. People trying to prevent Earth systems collapse have been sentenced to six months in prison for walking down a street ; or five years for discussing a protest on a Zoom call ; or have been prosecuted for correctly reminding juries that they have a right to use their consciences ; or for seeking to justify themselves in court . Hanging over all such peaceful dissenters is the possibility of 10 years in prison for the remarkably vague offence of ""public nuisance"". That's more than you'd get for most violent or sexual crimes. These are among the most draconian anti-protest measures in any country with democratic features. They are also the most extreme measures in common use in the UK for the past 150 years. The longest sentence received by any of the suffragettes, who engaged in far spikier actions than today's climate protesters, was three months . Those protesting on behalf of Gaza are subject to all these oppressive laws, and then some. The police have used measures in the Serious Crime Act 2015, which were never intended for this purpose, to arrest campaigners against the genocide on suspicion of participating in an organised crime group. It's preposterous and deeply sinister. It's not just that Starmer's government has failed to repeal these grim instruments and applications: it has actively defended them. After her attempt to redefine even mild protest as ""serious disruption"" was thrown out by the Lords, the then Tory home secretary, Suella Braverman, did something unprecedented: she reintroduced the measure as a statutory instrument, bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. Liberty mounted a legal challenge, and the high court ruled Braverman's action unlawful . The Tory government appealed. After the election, Labour was widely expected to drop the appeal. Instead it has continued the legal fight to uphold a disgraceful infringement of our rights and freedoms. These laws are accompanied by a wide range of parajudicial measures, such as the injunctions taken out by public bodies and private corporations, which enable protesters to be punished twice for the same crime. This means they face potentially enormous extra penalties . Extreme bail conditions have also been imposed, which can restrict protesters' movements, political freedoms and social lives for years on end. Even worse is the complete abandonment of equality before the law. Whether or not you get prosecuted for protesting is now a function of who you are. If you are a climate protester, you can get away with nothing. If you are a farmer, you can get away with anything. Even when, earlier this month, farmers blocked the road with tractors where the prime minister was speaking, drowned his speech with their horns and forced him to flee, the police let them get on with it. Thames Valley police explained : ""No arrests were made or necessary. The protest has reached its conclusion and the group are now dispersing from the area."" It is unimaginable that a climate protest of this kind would be allowed to reach this ""conclusion"". It would have been immediately broken up, with mass arrests and long sentences. Again, this selectivity is ready-made for the hard right. Farage has been appearing at farmers' protests, using them to advance toxic conspiracy fictions about immigration, just as similar movements did so successfully in the Netherlands. For a century, farmers have been celebrated by the right and extreme right as the true soul of the nation, endlessly threatened by ""cosmopolitans"", ""globalists"", immigrants, environmental regulators and other ""alien"" forces. Farmers have a fundamental right to protest, as we all do. But the blatant double standards in the application of protest law - the real two-tier policing - help to pre-legitimise authoritarianism. It's not just that the Labour government should repeal the draconian anti-protest laws because this would create a fairer society today. It's also because, in failing to do so, it primes the country for authoritarianism. Labour has helped normalise a far-right legal framework. What if a hard-right government sought to capitalise on that? It doesn't take a leap of imagination to see what will happen if the two things come together.",the Guardian,2025-02-22T07:00:02.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/keir-starmer-labour-illiberal-laws-hard-right-authoritarians
"For a stagnating left mired in pessimism, Milton’s radical vision is poetry in motion","'I s this pessimism?"", TJ Clark asks in his 2012 essay For a Left with No Future . ""Well, yes."" How else, he wonders, ""are we meant to understand the arrival of real ruin in the order of global finance... and the almost complete failure of left responses to it to resonate beyond the ranks of the faithful?"" Published originally in the New Left Review , the essay is part of Those Passions , a new collection of Clark's work. Clark is not a political theorist but a historian of art. A Marxist, much of his work explores the interface of art and politics with considerable nuance and depth, illuminating artists from Bosch to Pollock, Rembrandt to Lowry. The final section of the collection includes more straightforwardly political writing. For a Left with No Future is the weakest of the essays, whether on art or politics. It is nevertheless perhaps also the most significant, for not only does it provide a new perspective to much of Clark's other work, it also addresses a particularly keen question for our time - how should the left deal with its failure? In its pessimism and world-weariness, it seems to speak to many today. The title, Those Passions , is taken from Shelley's sonnet Ozymandias , an exploration of the inevitability of oblivion, a description of a half-buried statue of a once-great pharaoh of a once-great empire: ""Round the decay / Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away."" That desolate landscape is, for Clark, a metaphor for modern civilisation, made barren by consumerism and the reduction of all to a ""spectacle"". Even more, it is a poetic description of the terrain in which the left finds itself. ""If the past decade or so is not proof that there are no circumstances capable of reviving the left in its 20th-century form,"" he asks, ""then what would proof be like?"" It is a pessimism both exaggerated and understated. It is exaggerated because Clark finds the roots of the left's defeat in human nature, in ""the human propensity to violence"" and an inevitable ""hankering after evil"" woven into our very being. He finds it also in modernity itself, which has created such atomised, unthinking, obedient individuals that they are ""no longer material for a society"", a phrase borrowed from Nietzsche. These are not new ideas; but to root the left's demise in human nature and the nature of modernity is to deny the possibility of any resurrection. Indeed, Clark urges the left to abandon utopian ideas and embrace in its stead a ""tragic sense of life"". The tragic vision, which sustains a conservative view of the world, sees in the flawed and limited character of humans a warning against grand social change, insisting that faith, tradition and hierarchy are necessary guardrails against barbarism, a way of acknowledging, in the words of Leszek Kolakowski, the Polish Marxist turned Christian philosopher, ""life as inevitable defeat"". Yet, for all this, Clark's despair is also understated, because today's political malaise is more profound than he envisions - or is commonly acknowledged. It is not just the left that has imploded. Liberal and conservative traditions, too, have become drained of much of their life-force. These three main ideologies of modernity have clearly been antagonistic to each other. Yet they have also possessed a symbiotic relationship, one most clearly seen in the link between liberalism and radicalism. What we call liberal norms - democracy, equality, freedom of speech and association, the right of nations to self-determination and so on - became social realities largely through the efforts of radical movements and working-class organisations, and often in the face of ferocious opposition from liberal elites that sought to limit the scope of these norms, denying the majority of society, indeed the majority of the world, basic democratic rights. It was through the struggles of the dispossessed - of slaves to emancipate themselves, of colonial subjects confronting imperial rule, of the working class organising to improve their lives, of women claiming the right to vote - that liberal norms were made universal rather than remaining the exclusive property of a privileged few. The erosion of that radical universalist tradition has befuddled the left, detaching it from liberal traditions, and from class politics, and leaving the remnants more authoritarian and identitarian. It has also discombobulated liberalism. Without the buttress of radicalism, liberals themselves have become more illiberal, whether on free speech or democracy, and less willing to address issues of social inequality or working-class needs. Conservatism emerged initially as voicing hostility to modernity, and yet adapted to the new world so efficiently that it become a dominant governing force in a world painted largely in liberal tones. Over time, not liberalism but working-class and socialist movements became conservatism's principal enemy, an antagonistic relationship that helped define what conservatives wished to conserve. after newsletter promotion The erosion of the radical tradition has brought confusion to conservatism, too. Conservatives today seem to understand how to rip up the existing order, but have little conception about what should replace it, or what they wish to conserve. And so, we arrive in an age in which it is not just that the left has lost but that the main political traditions of modernity have all become exhausted. The book we need to make sense of these darkening times, Clark suggests, is Christopher Hill's The Experience of Defeat . First published in 1984, it is an exploration by the pre-eminent historian of 17th-century radicalism of the writings of English radicals after the crushing defeat that came with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, barely a decade after the execution of Charles I. The story that Hill tells cuts against the grain, though, of Clark's anti-utopianism. Hill depicts a generation of radicals defeated and subdued; but one that also sustained many who never abandoned their aspirations of renovating that radical tradition. John Milton was their ""prophet-poet"" who, in his last great epic poems, Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes , most eloquently expressed the possibilities of hope and redemption. Apart from the Quakers, none of the radical groups that throng the English revolution - the Levellers, the Diggers, the Ranters, the Muggletonians and others - endured. But their ideas did. The belief in equality, democracy and universal suffrage, the challenge to impoverishment and class distinctions, all became woven into new radical movements in the 18th century. And then, Hill observes, the poets of the new radicalism, from Blake to Shelley, ""turned back to Milton... and the vision of the poet-prophet"".",the Guardian,2025-03-02T08:00:05.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/stagnating-left-pessimism-milton-radical-vision
The Guardian view on a tax war: the world must unite against American obstruction,"D onald Trump's Oval Office tirade on Friday laid bare his instinct to harangue and bully those - even supposed allies such as Ukraine, fighting for its survival - who dare to disagree. Countries pushing global tax reform at the UN will be watching as US demands for subjugation play out in plain sight. His day-one threat to punish nations taxing US firms is an all-out attack on global fiscal cooperation. If multilateralism in taxation was already on shaky ground, Mr Trump's return could bury it for good. Under discussion is a new UN tax convention that may permit states to tax economic activity where it actually occurs, rather than allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) said last year that nations lose $492bn (PS390bn) annually due to corporate tax abuse. The global south bears the greatest losses, which undermine public services like health and education. If enacted, the convention would create a legally binding framework requiring multinationals to pay tax where they employ staff and do real business - not where they stash profits. This would replace the outdated arm's-length principle with unitary taxation, ensuring fair profit allocation. It would mean an end to Amazon , Google and Apple putting billions through lower-tax jurisdictions while extracting wealth from higher-tax ones. Before Mr Trump's election, about half of global tax losses were facilitated by the eight nations opposed to a UN tax convention - Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and the US. Yet opposition takes two forms: constructive and destructive. When negotiations for the UN framework convention on international tax cooperation began last month , all participants committed to the convention's principles except Mr Trump's delegate, who walked out in defiance, calling on others to follow. The expected exodus never came. Washington was left isolated. Mr Trump's ""America first"" became ""America alone"". But the US still has tremendous clout. As TJN's new report , The International Tax Consequences of President Trump, highlights, talks among 120-plus nations on taxing cross-border digital services - led by the US-dominated OECD - are grinding towards a showdown. Mr Trump's tariff threats against Canada and the EU are warning shots, aimed at countries daring to raise tax rates on multinationals, especially US ones. This fight isn't just about taxation; it's about sovereignty. Mr Trump's administration is trying to strong-arm nations into preserving a system that shields corporate profits from fair taxation. The difference now is that the world is pushing back. For decades, the US has had an unofficial veto over global tax rules, using its heft to shape - and then reject - OECD-led proposals. But this approach is no longer sustainable. The growing coalition behind the UN tax convention shows that many governments prefer to chart their own course. Mr Trump's return forces a stark choice: stick with a broken system that fuels tax abuse or push forward without the US. Any attempt to tax multinationals fairly will face American retaliation, but clinging to the OECD's US-dominated framework is a dead end. A united front at the UN is needed to forge a global tax system not dictated by Washington's whims. The cluster munitions convention succeeded without US involvement, proving international norms can shift without it. The world doesn't need US approval to fix global taxation. It needs the will to move forward together.",the Guardian,2025-03-02T17:30:13.000Z,Opinion,Commentary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-a-tax-war-the-world-must-unite-against-american-obstruction
