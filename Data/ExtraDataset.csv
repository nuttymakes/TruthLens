"The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil  Dr Can Erimtan 21st Century WireDid Donald J. Trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world?!? Did he have any idea that the whole wide world, including the United Nations, would turn against him?On Wednesday, 6 December 2017, in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room the President of the United States proceeded to make history, or, proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion: I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. In his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement, Trump explained that  [i]n 1995, [under Bill Clinton s watch, that is] Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.  In this way, the 45th U.S. President showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed, as he uttered words that neither Bill Clinton, nor George W. Bush or, more importantly perhaps, Barack Obama had dared speak.Yes, Trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name   in spite of the vehemently pro-Israel stance taken by the U.S. ever since the time of President Eisenhower (1953-61) and particularly, ever since the Six Day War (5-10 June 1967), in spite of the ceaseless activities of AIPAC and J Street, no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the New World and the Promised Land. Only, Donald J. Trump had the gall to  deliver,  doing what Clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise . . . until now, that is.In true Aristotelian fashion Trump took the potentiality that was Jerusalem (known as Al Quds or the Sacred City in the Muslim world) and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city. Following these presidential words, outspoken Israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the White House. Mark Regev, the erstwhile spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem (2004-7) and frequent Israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media, and currently even active as Israeli Ambassador in London (since 2015) blurted out that he  think[s] this was a just move and a good move for peace. His boss, Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu (fourth premiership, 2015 present) was equally forthcoming, talking to the press on the same day the U.S. President made his performance in the Diplomatic Reception Room:  Thank you President Trump for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  The PM in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words, declaring that  [t]here is no peace that doesn t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The idea that Jerusalem should be at the heart of the Jewish people s  land and nation namely has its roots in the Bible, in 2 Chronicles 6:5-6, to be precise:  Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel,  as worded in the New International Version. And Bibi knows that too.Bibi even took his words of praise abroad. First to Paris, where he met with President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged his U.S. counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room performance (10 December 2017). Bibi disagreed volubly with the Frenchman, characterising as  absurd  anyone not willing to recognise the  millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.  Next, even proceeding to refer to God s word that had elevated Jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple:  [y]ou can read it in a very fine book   it s called the Bible.  The following day he went to Brussels, where he attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (11 December 2017). The Israeli PM told the gathered EU FM as well as the assembled press corps that Trump s Jerusalem declaration  makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace. The Invention of the Jewish People and the Position of Jerusalem in IslamThe state of Israel, as a Jewish nation state implanted on Middle Eastern soil in 1948, employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence. The Israeli journalist and author Daniel Gavron, for example, states that  most Israelis [regard it as] axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3,000th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by King David [in 1995] mark[ed] a real and tangible event,  even though he himself doubts its authenticity. In other words, the Jewish people, as a shorthand for the Israeli citzenry, have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by Bibi for quite a while. But, as I explained at length some time ago, the mere mention of the term  nation  or even just  people  is a problematic issue in its own right   the point that I am trying to get across is that  nations  or  people  cannot be perceived as  natural  or even  organic  phenomena, but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger  artificial  whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures   leaders of men and their organisations. It has been nearly ten years now that the historian Schlomo Sand published his groundbreaking text The Invention of the Jewish People, which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner, amongst others, but, as seems blatantly apparent from looking at Bibi s recent proclamations, his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble, in spite of having topped Israeli bestseller list  for nineteen weeks. With regard to the city of Jerusalem, on the other hand, archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the  site has been continuously occupied for some 5,000 years,  signalling the urban centre s pre-Jewish roots. But the notion that King David conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky. Gavron explains that the  biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have, and in the opinion of most modern scholars, the Bible is not an entirely reliable historical document.  Still, archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain David indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century BCE   namely, a small  triangular piece of basalt rock . . . subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of Syria and later smashed by an Israelite ruler  carrying an Aramaic inscription talking about a  Beit David ( House  or  Dynasty of David ). But the Jewish  conquest  of Jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover and/or occupation: remaining in ancient times, the Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 BCE, whereas the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign (598 BCE), but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of Titus, son of the Roman Emperor Vespasian (70 CE), in response to the Jews  Great Revolt against Rome that had sprung up in 66 CE. The ultimate outcome of Rome s harsh response was the  Diaspora,  as explained by the American rabbi, lecturer, and author Joseph Telushkin, who estimates that  as many as one million Jews died  as a result, while carrying in its wake the  almost two-thousand-year span of Jewish homelessness and exile.  With the majority of Jews apparently dispersed from the land and city, Jerusalem was eventually conquered by the Caliph Umar (reign 634-44) in the year 638, an event which seems to have taken place following a  peaceful siege, no blood was shed,  in the words of Zia H Shah, a New York-based physician and the Chief Editor of the Muslim Times. The addition of Jerusalem to the Dar al-Islam (or, the abode of Islam) was important. Though the city s name does not appear specifically in the Quran (containing only a reference to  al-Masjid al- Aqsa  or the  Furthest Mosque,  17:1), it is the locus of the Prophet s miraculous Night Journey (or Mi raj). The story, as related in various prophetic traditions (or hadith), tells how the figure of the Prophet travelled from  Makkah to the Furthest Mosque (in Jerusalem), from whence he ascended Heaven, so that Allah might  show him of Our signs. As a result, the Masjid al- Aqsa, arguably built by the Caliph Umar though no historical records exist to this effect, is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in Islam, following the Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, and Al Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah.A Pseudo-Ottoman Gambit: Diverting Attention for a PurposeAs a result, Donald Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room stunt far supersedes the thorny Palestinian issue, the life-and-death matter of peace in the Middle East, or even the real estate division between East and West Jerusalem. The English-language pan-Arab television channel Al Jazeera English matter-of-factly point out on its website that  [v]iolence, protests and arrests have followed US President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All across the globe Muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of Trump s latest attempt to act like a real president, a president unlike any of his predecessors:  [r]allies against Trump s decision also took place in the Indian city of Mumbai, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and the Japanese capital, Tokyo.  But also in Turkey   where President Recept Tayyip Erdo an (aka the Prez)  has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the Ottoman sultans of old   after all, Sultan Selim I (1512-20) took hold of the city of Jerusalem in 1517, remaining part of the Ottoman fold till the onset of the British Mandate (1917-48). On Thursday and Friday, (7-8 December 2017),  spontaneous  meetings took place throughout the whole of the country, from Istanbul over Bursa, Ankara, and Mersin, to Hatay, Gaziantep, Tatvan, Adana, Van, and Kahramanmara . More importantly, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held a meeting in Istanbul on 13 December 2017, and the Prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of Islam, defying not just the United States of America and Israel, but also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nominal Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. As I have written quite some time ago, the Prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally King Salman and see himself as the rightful Calip of the world of Islam, in true pseudo-Ottoman fashion.The OIC meeting dutifully released its  Istanbul Declaration on  Freedom for Al Quds' : [a]ppreciating the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting the Extraordinary Islamic Summit regarding this important cause of Ummah, especially the call for this Extraordinary Summit made by His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdo an (image, left), President of the Republic of Turkey . . . We reject and condemn the US Administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of Al Quds . . . Just like the fact that Israel s decision to annex Al Quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted, we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience, justice and history. We invite all members of the UN, the EU and the international community to remain committed to the status of Al Quds and all related UN Resolutions. Rather than accomplishing anything much at all, the extraordinary OIC meeting primarily served to heighten Tayyip  Erdo an s prestige, at home as well as abroad. As such, a cynic would say that Trump s timing was impeccable, as 17/25 December marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as #AKPgate that erupted in 2013, and that presently was very much on people s minds in Turkey given that the Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab (or R za Sarraf, in Turkish) was appearing in court in New York. The court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon Iran and many Turks eagerly followed the proceedings on Twitter. One Istanbul-based writer Kareem Shaheen described the accusations as follows:  [i]n a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday [30 November 2017] that [Tayyip] Erdo an, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had [also] bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer  a layan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. As a result, given that the Zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire Turco-American relationship, Trump s Jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for Erdogan. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital finally absolved the Erdogan from any attempts to salvage the cross-Atlantic relationship, and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the Republic of Turkey is now the rightful heir to the Ottoman Empire and the only hope left for Muslims across the world, Muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive U.S. foreign policy. And, putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent, Erdo an announced on Thursday, 17 December 2017, that he would establish a Turkish Embassy in Jerusalem, representing Ankara in Palestine, to be clear. Speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of Karaman, the Prez declared  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  in Jerusalem.All the while, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and Israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the Gaza strip and crack down on Palestinian protesters But, Trump has done his deed, leaving his indelible mark on the Middle East, while the Prez, in turn, can now rightfully claim that he alone is able to represent the Muslim world on the international arena.*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent scholar who was living in Istanbul for some time, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East.

"Active Shooter Drill Suddenly ‘Goes Live’ at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland SEE ALSO: 21WIRE calls out US media for hyping fake  Active Shooter  event at Andrews BaseDaily Shooter 21st Century WireWashington DC area was put on high alert today following reports of an  Active Shooter  a Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home of the president s Air Force One private jet.The base has been placed on lock-down and first responders are on-scene following a report of an active shooter at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located on Andrews.Authorities have instructed all personnel continue to  shelter in place. JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016There s only one problem with this story: we also learned that the base had planned a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am this morning, and as if by some amazing coincidence, during exercise, local first responders received emergency calls about a  real world  active shooter on the base. Still, this hasn t stopped flippant news anchors and  expert  analysts from US media outlets like CNN and FOX News from going into media-siege mode, and treating the event as if it were a real  active shooter  event   and injecting addition, unnecessary fear in the public discourse this morning.If one follows the inter-agency security protocols for a security exercise such as this, it would play out more or less exactly as it has today thus far, as evidenced by announcements by what other law enforcement and emergency services are saying.NBC News local affiliate adds here: Fort Belvoir in Virginia says it is increasing its  security posture  in response to the incident at Joint Base Andrews. It has advised its personnel to stay clear of Joint Base Andrews.  Last month Andrews had another  active  event, in what apparently turned-out to be a non-threat. Last month, Joint Base Andrews was placed on lockdown after a woman walked onto the base and claimed she had a bomb. An Explosive Ordinance Disposal team found the woman had no explosives, and she was apprehended.  The only question left now is: is this a real  active shooter  situation, or is this merely another example of a  drill gone live ?UPDATE 11:15AM ET: [Yes, we called it before authorities finally admitted  it was only drill ] JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md.  Andrews Air Force Base is  all clear  after a lock-down Thursday morning, amid confusion during an active shooter drill, according to a law enforcement official. According to a public information officer in the Washington office, the reason for this is because of the confusion over reports of a drill or an actual incident. The FBI field offices let security on Joint Base Andrews sort out the confusion.  (FOX6 NOW) Joint Base Andrews was locked down just after 9 a.m. after someone mistook an active shooter drill for the real thing, senior law enforcement officials told NBC News. All personnel were directed to shelter in place,  said NBC News.""All Clear.""

"BREAKING: STARBUCKS CEO To Step Down After Pledge To Hire 10,000 Refugees BACKFIRES The arrogance of a CEO of a major company like Starbucks, that would put his radical political opinions above the health of the company and the stockholders is astounding. The idea that Howard Schultz believed he could say Starbucks would make hiring 10,000 refugees a priority, while so many Americans are out of work, and it wouldn t harm the Starbucks brand is beyond foolish Howard Schultz, the current CEO of Starbucks, will step down from his role at the giant coffee chain next month.The move comes after his vow to hire thousands refugees in response to President Donald Trump s first travel ban appeared to hurt customer sentiment and dent their sales.Trump supporters have called for a boycott of the chain since January 29, when Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years.Schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the American Dream was  being called into question  and that  the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack. He was also a public Clinton supporter and prominent democrat, and even considered as a running mate for the Democratic nominee at one point.Almost immediately consumer perception levels took a hit as measured by YouGov BrandIndex s Buzz score, falling by two-thirds between January 29 and February 13.At the time, analysts at Credit Suisse said the coffee giant s move had a negative impact on recent sales, and could continue to hurt them in the near future.Schultz, with an estimated net worth of $3.1billion, will remain at Starbucks as executive chairman and will focus on strengthening the company s high-end coffee shops.Schultz will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, Starbucks  chief operating officer, on April 3, 2017, The Seattle Times reported.

"DO WOMAN WANT TO ELECT A BULLY Whose Campaign Works With Shady Operatives To Incite Violence Against Women, Children And Senior Citizens? [VIDEO] As a mother of three young girls, Hillary is the last person I would consider a role model for women. She is cold, calculating and has a long history of disrespect and accounts of  violent behavior towards her subordinates and even her husband Bill. More than one secret service agent has come forward to tell the truth about Hillary and her violent temper. One of her secret service agents tells of the disrespect Hillary showed for  the secret service agents who risked their lives to keep her safe by greeting them with,  F**k off! It s enough that I have to see you shit-kickers every day, I m not going to talk to you too!! Just do your G*damn job and keep your mouth shut. (From the book  American Evita  by Christopher Anderson, p. 90- Hillary to her State Trooper bodyguards after one of them greeted her with  Good morning. ) In  The Clintons  War On Women  (Skyhorse), out Oct. 13, political strategist Roger Stone details Hillary s abusive behavior   dating back to the Clintons  days in Arkansas, where Bill served as governor. Hillary Clinton has a long history of being domestically violent with Bill,  Stone writes.  Hillary has beaten Bill, hit him with hard objects, scratched and clawed him, and made him bleed. When you spend your whole life acting like a bully, it should come as no surprise to anyone that Hillary would approve of the kind of hateful behavior we ve seen from her supporters towards the only man who has the ability to take away the one goal she s worked for her entire life. Effective leaders inspire movements that exist only when people choose to move in the same direction. Without a leader, movements fragment and get nowhere. The leader s job is to inspire people to work together in the service of something greater than themselves. Does anyone really believe that Trump supporters deserved to be sucker punched, kicked, beaten, or have objects lobbed at their heads and bodies? What if the reason innocent Trump supporters were randomly attacked is because a certain  leader  of the Democratic Party feels her grip on the American people slipping away by an outside force she never counted on?What if Hillary actually condoned violence against Trump supporters, as a way to intimidate them, hoping they d be afraid to attend future Trump rallies? What if the massive number of Trump supporters showing up at his rallies caused Hillary to panic and  fear she may have to explain to the press why she couldn t even fill a high school gym with her supporters?What if Trump represented all that the Left has fought so hard to erase from American history and culture?  And what if Hillary was working in conjunction with our current President and other underground figures actually condoned this kind of violence against Trump supporters even paid for it?If you ve seen any of the recently released Project Veritas videos, you d know that this is not only a possibility, but a shocking reality. Even some of the most ardent supporters of Hillary should be sickened by the actions this woman and her party are willing take in order to maintain their power.Here are a few videos every American should see before stepping into the voting booths or mailing in their absentee ballots. Every American needs to ask themselves if they want to see a leader who inspires violence, division and hate or, if they desire a true leader of all people, who has one goal to make Make America Great Again Here s Donald Trump on the violence committed against his supporters:Here s Hillary committing psychological warfare against Trump and his supporters, as she attempts to blame Donald for the violence being committed against his followers:https://youtu.be/lAoYEY6DSscThese violent anti-Trump activists will harm anyone who gets in the way of them achieving their goals, even an 8 and 11 year old girl:Our very own Vice President Joe Biden says he d like beat up Donald Trump behind the gym.

" Hillary Clinton Just Tossed Charles Koch A HUGE F*ck You After Kinda-Sorta-Endorsement (SCREENSHOTS) We have some bad news for Charles Koch: Hillary Clinton just isn t that into you. Recently, the evil billionaire backer of the Tea Party announced that Republicans are so terrible, he is forced to admit that Hillary Clinton is possibly better than all of them. Koch told ABC s This Week that Clinton s husband was a much better President in terms of government spending than was George W. Bush, who is idolized by many conservatives. In some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn t an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton,  Koch said, explaining that for Hillary to be a better President than the entire Republican field, she would have to be a gigantic hypocrite who can be bought and sold like everyone else they back. Asked if he would support her campaign for President, Koch said: We would have to believe her actions would be quite different from her rhetoric, let me put it that way. While Koch is in love with Clinton as anyone on the Right is going to get, he probably should not expect much from her. On Sunday, Clinton let the Koch brothers know what she thinks of them and their money by essentially telling Charles to go f*ck himself.Referencing the Kochs  climate denial and attempts to suppress minority voters, Clinton explained that she could not accept an endorsement from someone so evil.  Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote,  she said, linking the interview.Yes, it s no secret that the Republican field is chock-full of terribleness, but Koch is almost certainly not going to find any friends among Democrats these days. It s far, far too late for that.Watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvqf3mSz8yQFeatured image via Getty Images (John Moore)/screengrab",1
" The White House Just Confessed The REAL Reason For Syria Attack; It Is DISGUSTING (DETAILS) While many have been baffled and upset by Donald Trump s reckless decision to attack Syria (without Congressional approval), the inner details of what drove Trump to make such a decision are even worse.Senior White House officials have just confessed that this attack against Syria was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Trump, to feed his out of control ego. According to those officials, the poorly planned missile strike (which ultimately failed) isn t even part of a broader strategy or a step in a larger plan to remove Assad. It was absolutely meaningless, and its only purpose was to make Trump seem like a strong leader.CNN s Jim Acosta reported:While it s not surprising that Trump has no strategy for Syria (let s face it, he has zero strategy for anything he does), it s terrifying to actually see it play out before our eyes as an incompetent president puts America in grave danger.Basically, Trump used the U.S. military to make it LOOK like he was taking some sort of action on Syria, when really the exact opposite is true. There is no plan, and there likely will never be one. What Trump put on last night was merely a performance   and a damaging one. Already, U.S.-Russia relations have grown more tense as Russia is making moves to punish America for Trump s carelessness.The message Trump is sending to the world is terrifying   what we can expect during Trump s presidency is a show; just big empty gestures that won t actually carry any weight. Trump has basically shown Assad that he s not really going to do anything besides send 50 missiles his way.

" Bernie Sanders Just Used Trump’s Own Tweets To Publicly Shame Him On The Senate Floor Donald Trump s tweets just became the club progressives like Bernie Sanders are going to use to hammer him with over the next four years.It s no secret that Trump is obsessed with spewing all kinds of bullshit on Twitter, but they are a liability that will make Republicans regret making Trump their leader.Because messages on Twitter can live forever. Even if Trump deletes them, there are likely always going to be copies that were captured via screenshot.But Bernie Sanders didn t need to worry about that because Trump rarely deletes his past tweets, which made things awkward for Trump and the Senate Republicans as Sanders took to the floor to passionately defend Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, all three of which Republicans want to gut after Trump takes office on January 20th.Throughout the primaries and the presidential campaign, Trump told his supporters that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Most prominently, he repeated that message on Twitter in May 2015 to claim that Mike Huckabee copied him by saying the same thing. I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,  Trump wrote.  Huckabee copied me. Well, during his time on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sanders used that very tweet against Trump, even going so far as to blow it up for all to see, to demonstrate that if Trump signs any legislation Republicans send him to target these sacred programs, he would be breaking a core promise to the people who voted for him.Sanders began by calling out Republicans for cruelly seeking to repeal Obamacare, which would leave millions of Americans without health insurance and increase the deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars.He then slammed Republicans for taking at a Medicare in their budget bill, a move that would eliminate Medicare as it currently exists, a government-run program that actually works to provide senior citizens the healthcare they need at a far lower cost than a private insurance plan would provide.Sanders also repeated a statement Trump made on April 8, 2015. Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security,  Trump said.  They want to do it on Medicare and they want to do it on Medicaid and we can t do it. It s not fair to the people who have been paying in for years. In March, Trump attacked Paul Ryan for planning to gut Medicare, but Trump made it clear that he doesn t support Ryan s plan because it will cost Republicans the election. Millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word,  Sanders declared.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is already backing away from his promises, which means his supporters were duped in the worst way. They were stabbed in the back and now have to face a future where Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and Obamacare do not exist. And they only have themselves to blame for believing Trump in the first place.Featured image via screenshot",0

I admire your business background and have started my own business. I ve been mowing my neighbors  lawns for some time, please see the attached flyer, here s a list of what I have and you re free to pick whatever you want: power mower, push mower, and weed whacker, I can bring extra fuel for the power mower and charge batteries for the weed whacker, and I ll do that with no charge.Sincerely,Frank. Huckabee-Sanders, who is a mother of 3 young children, was probably tickled pink to offer President Trump s response to this ambitious young man in person: Frank, I m happy to report back to you that I just spoke with the President, he wanted me to be sure and tell you that you re doing a great job and keep working hard. He also asked me, we found out when we called, to let you know that we would be reading this letter to wish you a happy birthday. I think Frank went from 10 to 11 in the time that we received and were able to respond to this letter, and he also wanted to invite you to spend a morning here at the White House with the groundskeeper.

"HILLARY FINALLY Makes Statement On Sexual Predator and Mega-Democrat Donor Harvey Weinstein…Gets DESTROYED By Bill Clinton Rape Accuser After several days of silence, Hillary Clinton finally made a statement on the disgraced billionaire Hollywood movie producer and mega-Democrat donor, Harvey Weinstein. Well, actually Hillary really didn t come out and make a statement, true to form, Hillary hid behind her former State Department communications director, Nick Merrill, as he posted a response on behalf of Hillary about the monster predator, and one of her top donors to her presidential campaign, the virulently anti-Trump, Harvey Weinstein.Perhaps the delay in the statement was due to the pressure from Americans for Democrats to return or donate campaign contributions from the disgraced scumbag Hollywood kingpin.From Deadline: Something in the neighborhood of $1.8 million was raised at Harvey Weinstein s star-packed fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in New York City Monday night, sources tell Deadline. The event for 50 or so Clinton supporters at Weinstein s Manhattan home drew some major Hollywood names, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Candice Bergen, Bethenny Frankel and designers Vera Wang and Tory Burch.Don t hold your breath waiting for Hillary to return the $1.8 million that Weinstein and his co-hosts Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick and Leonardo DiCaprio raised for Crooked Hillary s presidential campaign.Here is the statement that Merrill released on behalf of the hiding Hillary:Statement from Secretary Clinton on Harvey Weinstein: pic.twitter.com/L1l2wl9l0I  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 10, 2017Funny, Hillary was not only silent about the rape Juanita Broaddrick claims her husband Bill committed, according to Broaddrick, Hillary went out of her way to silence her.I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark.

" Ben Carson: Homeless Shelters Shouldn’t Be “Comfortable” Because People Might “Stay” If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration. As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.  But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say. He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them. The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say:  I ll just stay here. They will take care of me. It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word  compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit. Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami. While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves. Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",0
"LEO DITCHES HILLARY: Shady Excuse Doesn’t Fly In DiCaprio Fundraiser Cancellation If you believe this excuse, you ll believe anything..Leo dumps Hillary:Leo DiCaprio abruptly backed out of hosting a $33,400-per-guest fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at his LA home on Tuesday, saying the change in plans was because of the production schedule for a documentary he s producing   but not everybody is convinced of the story.The move came just days after the Hollywood Reporter said the star and his eponymous foundation could be linked to a scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, at the same time Hillary and Bill Clinton s own charitable fund is under scrutiny.Leo has been seen out and about in the Hamptons with his latest super model guess he couldn t squeeze in any work:Guests attending the Clinton event in LA were notified via email over the weekend that  the production schedule for [DiCaprio s] climate change film  Before the Flood  has altered . . . which will prevent him from returning to Los Angeles . . .

" Queen’s Brian May: We Don’t Want Our Music Used In Trump’s ‘Unsavory Campaign’ There have been many musical artists who have demanded that Donald Trump cease and desist using their tunes to rile up the crowds at his campaign rallies, and the lead guitarist for the iconic rock band Queen, Brian May, has just become the latest. May found out that Trump had used the Queen hit  We are the Champions  at an event, and immediately spoke out, saying to fans who made him aware of Trump s use of Queen s songs: I will make sure we take what steps we can to dissociate ourselves from Donald Trump s unsavoury campaign. He also says that as a matter of policy that Queen does not usually allow their music to be used by politicians, period, and wrote on his own personal website: This is not an official Queen statement, but I can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given. We are taking advice on what steps we can take to ensure this use does not continue. Regardless of our views on Mr Trump s platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool. Our music embodies our own dreams and beliefs, but it is for all who care to listen and enjoy. Just a little while ago, REM s music was used by Trump, and the response from former lead singer Michael Stipe was nothing short of delicious: Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you   you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign. In other words, rock stars don t want a damn thing to do with Donald Trump. He really better be careful, because he s going to wind up with even more lawsuits and legal trouble than he already has. Face it, Donald   the only musician who wants you using his music is Ted Nugent, and that s really not saying much at all.

"Shocking Report: Mind Blowing Cost of Illegals Is Highest Ever…Numbers Released Show Huge Burden To States [Video] EVERY American taxpayer should be outraged at the numbers in the report below. Open borders under 8 years of Obama is costing American taxpayers a tremendous amount more than ever before! Don t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR: Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE S THOMAS HOMAN S TESTIMONY FROM 2014: Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion. State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled  The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,  is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets. Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,  said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein.  President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,  said Stein.  Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,  he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don t come close to offsetting the costs. What s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table. The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,  said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",0

" Carrier To Employees: Donald Trump Lied, We’re Still Sending 1,300 Jobs To Mexico While Donald Trump may have bribed Carrier into keeping some 800 jobs in the United States with millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives   a dangerous precedent, as companies now know they only need to threaten to move out of the United States to get massive gifts from the Trump administration   one thing he doesn t even acknowledge is that more jobs will still be going to Mexico than will stay in the United States.In a deal that even stalwart Trump supporter calls a  hallmark of corruption  and  crony capitalism,  Trump and Pence offered the company $7 million to keep a small portion of the jobs they planned to move across the border in Indiana. The problem is that the company will still be moving 1,300 jobs Trump and his crew refuse to speak about. But Carrier was forthright with employees in a companywide letter explaining The Donald s attempt to deceive the American public into thinking he was doing some actual good. While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,  the letter tells employees. Carrier explains that regardless of any deal with Trump they intend to  move forward with previously unannounced plans  to relocate 1,300 jobs to Mexico by the end of the year. We recognize that this has been very difficult for your families,  the letter says, praising employees for continuing to work even knowing the company intended to f*ck them over with or without Donald Trump s input.  We greatly appreciate this and sincerely thank you for all your efforts.

"HOLY TAX PLAN! Bernie Sanders Released His Plan For “Freebies” For All Hey Bernie fans! You might want to take a look at this:BernieSanders.com, Medicare for All: Leaving No One Behind:How Much Will It Cost and How Do We Pay For It?How Much Will It Cost? This plan has been estimated to cost $1.38 trillion per year.The Plan Would Be Fully Paid For By:A 6.2 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers. Revenue raised: $630 billion per year.A 2.2 percent income-based premium paid by households. Revenue raised: $210 billion per year.This year, a family of four taking the standard deduction can have income up to $28,800 and not pay this tax under this plan.A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.Progressive income tax rates. Revenue raised: $110 billion a year.Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be:37 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000. 43 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million. 48 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2013, only 113,000 households, the top 0.08 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.) 52 percent on income above $10 million. (In 2013, only 13,000 households, just 0.01 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.) Taxing capital gains and dividends the same as income from work. Revenue raised: $92 billion per year.Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest American in the country, has said that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. The reason is that he receives most of his income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a much lower rate than income from work. This plan will end the special tax break for capital gains and dividends on household income above $250,000.Limit tax deductions for rich. Revenue raised: $15 billion per yearUnder Bernie s plan, households making over $250,000 would no longer be able to save more than 28 cents in taxes from every dollar in tax deductions. This limit would replace more complicated and less effective limits on tax breaks for the rich including the AMT, the personal exemption phase-out and the limit on itemized deductions.The Responsible Estate Tax. Revenue raised: $21 billion per year.This provision would tax the estates of the wealthiest 0.3 percent (three-tenths of 1 percent) of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million at progressive rates and close loopholes in the estate tax.Savings from health tax expenditures. Revenue raised: $310 billion per year.Several tax breaks that subsidize health care (health-related  tax expenditures ) would become obsolete and disappear under a single-payer health care system, saving $310 billion per year.Most importantly, health care provided by employers is compensation that is not subject to payroll taxes or income taxes under current law. This is a significant tax break that would effectively disappear under this plan because all Americans would receive health care through the new single-payer program instead of employer-based health care.Via: TAXPROFBLOG",1

" This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it. Period.Featured image via KIRO7",1
" Right Wing Drudge Report Calls Beyoncé An ‘Urban Terrorist’ Because Racism Is Dead In America Beyonc  is already a favorite target of hate for the right-wing because she s: A. Black B. A woman C. Rich D. Powerful E. Not ashamed of being black and F. Did I mention she s black? But the so-racist-it-might-as-well-be-Stormfront Drudge Report took Beyonc  hating to a new low because of the  Hold Up  music video released over the weekend.Off of the album  Lemonade,  Hold Up is a suuuuuper angry song and video dealing with Beyonc s very justifiable rage at her husband Jay-Z for cheating on her. In the video, she takes a bat and smashes the crap out of stuff. It s not entirely clear why this is controversial in the slightest. Anyone who s been cheated on wants to smash everything around them; it s a perfectly natural reaction to that kind of hurt and betrayal. So, of course, Drudge Report responded to it like this: Urban,  of course, is a right-wing dog whistle for  ni**er  but why a  terrorist?  Oh, right, because Beyonc  supports Black Lives Matter and had the nerve to recognize black history during the Super Bowl so anything she does these days is scary to the poor, persecuted white minority of America.The article Drudge links to is just as tasteless, shoehorning in President Obama and soon-to-be-president Hillary Clinton by lamenting that Obama, previously a fan,  may be changing his policy on Beyonc .  Because only white people are allowed to be angry or something. When black people do it, they re out of control and savages. Didn t you know that already?Later, the article comments on Beyonc s album about being cheated on and forgiving her husband by saying:Indeed, all of  Lemonade  appears to be Beyonc  saying she s made lemonade from lemons  meaning she s somehow stuck it out in a bad marriage despite lying and infidelity. That sounds more like the Clintons  story than the Obamas .HAHAHAHAHAHAH! That didn t feel forced at all. Even a little.Now, if Beyonc had gone out and actually smashed people s cars in a rage instead of channeling her anger into a creatively destructive music video, OK, fine, call her names. But for the love of all that s holy, it s a MUSIC VIDEO. I know Drudge makes money by feeding the hate and rage of the right-wing but this is a stretch, even for them.By the way, if you want to see Beyonce get righteous with a bat, you ll have to go to TIDAL and sign up for a free trial.Featured image via Getty",1
"WHOA! FIRST LADY MELANIA Makes Classy, Yet Blistering Response To Kathy Griffin’s ISIS Inspired Photo Of Decapitated President Trump Social media erupted yesterday when outspoken comedian Kathy Griffin, posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields where she held a bloodied, decapitated mask of President Trump.Today, Melania Trump questioned Kathy Griffin s mental health in a blistering statement after she posted a photo of her holding a bloodied, decapitated version of President Trump s head.The video posted on Twitter of Griffin holding the decapitated head of President Trump has since been removed. As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,  the first lady said in a statement Wednesday.  When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.   Daily CallerPresident Trump took to Twitter to respond to the unbelievably vile comedian Kathy Griffin. Trump s tweet also reminded Griffin that he has an 11-year old son who has the ability to see her disgusting depiction of his father s bloodied, decapitated head:Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.

" Pat Robertson Endorses Trump: He ‘Inspires Us All’ (VIDEO) Uncle Pat is off his meds again. The crazy host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s decades-long hit show The 700 Club has endorsed Donald Trump. Even though Trump never showed any indication of being a devout Christian prior to his running for the GOP presidential nomination, Robertson has decided that Trump is the man if you want to vote Christian. In a recent event at Regent University, Robertson gave Trump glowing praise, saying that he  inspires us all.  He also said that Trump is  the most amazing people in the whole country.  Here is the video, via Right Wing Watch:Christian Broadcasting Network reporter David Brody also heaped praise upon Trump, and afterwards, Trump continued his now-familiar anti-immigrant rhetoric to his crowd of rabidly racist supporters. He went went so far as to insist that any policy but his would result in, and I quote, the idea that  every illegal gets an air conditioner. Nevermind the fact that this has never been proposed by anyone who likes the idea of legalized paths to citizenship   it s just plain stupid. The only plan for Trump right now is to promote pure, unabashed hatred toward anyone not straight, white, male, and Christian. Thanks to the GOP creating this hateful base, it should be no surprise that these are Trump s supporters.Thusly, it is also no surprise that one of those said supporters is hateful television preacher Pat Robertson.Watch another video of this nonsense below:Featured image via video screen capture",1
"DO WOMAN WANT TO ELECT A BULLY Whose Campaign Works With Shady Operatives To Incite Violence Against Women, Children And Senior Citizens? [VIDEO] As a mother of three young girls, Hillary is the last person I would consider a role model for women. She is cold, calculating and has a long history of disrespect and accounts of  violent behavior towards her subordinates and even her husband Bill. More than one secret service agent has come forward to tell the truth about Hillary and her violent temper. One of her secret service agents tells of the disrespect Hillary showed for  the secret service agents who risked their lives to keep her safe by greeting them with,  F**k off! It s enough that I have to see you shit-kickers every day, I m not going to talk to you too!! Just do your G*damn job and keep your mouth shut. (From the book  American Evita  by Christopher Anderson, p. 90- Hillary to her State Trooper bodyguards after one of them greeted her with  Good morning. ) In  The Clintons  War On Women  (Skyhorse), out Oct. 13, political strategist Roger Stone details Hillary s abusive behavior   dating back to the Clintons  days in Arkansas, where Bill served as governor. Hillary Clinton has a long history of being domestically violent with Bill,  Stone writes.  Hillary has beaten Bill, hit him with hard objects, scratched and clawed him, and made him bleed. When you spend your whole life acting like a bully, it should come as no surprise to anyone that Hillary would approve of the kind of hateful behavior we ve seen from her supporters towards the only man who has the ability to take away the one goal she s worked for her entire life. Effective leaders inspire movements that exist only when people choose to move in the same direction. Without a leader, movements fragment and get nowhere. The leader s job is to inspire people to work together in the service of something greater than themselves. Does anyone really believe that Trump supporters deserved to be sucker punched, kicked, beaten, or have objects lobbed at their heads and bodies? What if the reason innocent Trump supporters were randomly attacked is because a certain  leader  of the Democratic Party feels her grip on the American people slipping away by an outside force she never counted on?What if Hillary actually condoned violence against Trump supporters, as a way to intimidate them, hoping they d be afraid to attend future Trump rallies? What if the massive number of Trump supporters showing up at his rallies caused Hillary to panic and  fear she may have to explain to the press why she couldn t even fill a high school gym with her supporters?What if Trump represented all that the Left has fought so hard to erase from American history and culture?  And what if Hillary was working in conjunction with our current President and other underground figures actually condoned this kind of violence against Trump supporters even paid for it?If you ve seen any of the recently released Project Veritas videos, you d know that this is not only a possibility, but a shocking reality. Even some of the most ardent supporters of Hillary should be sickened by the actions this woman and her party are willing take in order to maintain their power.Here are a few videos every American should see before stepping into the voting booths or mailing in their absentee ballots. Every American needs to ask themselves if they want to see a leader who inspires violence, division and hate or, if they desire a true leader of all people, who has one goal to make Make America Great Again Here s Donald Trump on the violence committed against his supporters:Here s Hillary committing psychological warfare against Trump and his supporters, as she attempts to blame Donald for the violence being committed against his followers:https://youtu.be/lAoYEY6DSscThese violent anti-Trump activists will harm anyone who gets in the way of them achieving their goals, even an 8 and 11 year old girl:Our very own Vice President Joe Biden says he d like beat up Donald Trump behind the gym.

"HOLY TAX PLAN! Bernie Sanders Released His Plan For “Freebies” For All Hey Bernie fans! You might want to take a look at this:BernieSanders.com, Medicare for All: Leaving No One Behind:How Much Will It Cost and How Do We Pay For It?How Much Will It Cost? This plan has been estimated to cost $1.38 trillion per year.The Plan Would Be Fully Paid For By:A 6.2 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers. Revenue raised: $630 billion per year.A 2.2 percent income-based premium paid by households. Revenue raised: $210 billion per year.This year, a family of four taking the standard deduction can have income up to $28,800 and not pay this tax under this plan.A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.Progressive income tax rates. Revenue raised: $110 billion a year.Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be:37 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000. 43 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million. 48 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2013, only 113,000 households, the top 0.08 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.) 52 percent on income above $10 million. (In 2013, only 13,000 households, just 0.01 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.) Taxing capital gains and dividends the same as income from work. Revenue raised: $92 billion per year.Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest American in the country, has said that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. The reason is that he receives most of his income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a much lower rate than income from work. This plan will end the special tax break for capital gains and dividends on household income above $250,000.Limit tax deductions for rich. Revenue raised: $15 billion per yearUnder Bernie s plan, households making over $250,000 would no longer be able to save more than 28 cents in taxes from every dollar in tax deductions. This limit would replace more complicated and less effective limits on tax breaks for the rich including the AMT, the personal exemption phase-out and the limit on itemized deductions.The Responsible Estate Tax. Revenue raised: $21 billion per year.This provision would tax the estates of the wealthiest 0.3 percent (three-tenths of 1 percent) of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million at progressive rates and close loopholes in the estate tax.Savings from health tax expenditures. Revenue raised: $310 billion per year.Several tax breaks that subsidize health care (health-related  tax expenditures ) would become obsolete and disappear under a single-payer health care system, saving $310 billion per year.Most importantly, health care provided by employers is compensation that is not subject to payroll taxes or income taxes under current law. This is a significant tax break that would effectively disappear under this plan because all Americans would receive health care through the new single-payer program instead of employer-based health care.Via: TAXPROFBLOG",0
"BOOM! FOX NEWS LEFTIST CHRIS WALLACE Attempts Trump Smear Over Inauguration Crowd Size…FOX News’ Brit Hume Backs Up Trump On Fake News Story [VIDEO] The AP, CNN, People Magazine and other mainstream media, fake news outlets used pictures of the crowds at Obama s inauguration to compare to the crowd s at Trump s inauguration. The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W. Bush s inauguration crowds, because instead of the full-blown media assassination attempt we see against President Trump, the post-inauguration media coverage was more like an all out effort to canonize Barack Obama by our sycophant media.The media completely ignored the fact that threats of violence were being made by Soros funded groups against Trump supporters since the day after the election. They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats. They used human chains to lock visitors out of certain areas including check points where Trump supporters had to pass through in order to get to the inauguration and to the parade.Watch this husband and wife, as they are split up by human barricades. The husband manages to break through the barricade but the wife is trapped and unable to join him. (Does anyone remember seeing this on the news?):#Trump supporter gets past #DisruptJ20 barricade but couldn't get back to his wife #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/JFHOcgcT9c  Alex Rubinstein (@RealAlexRubi) January 20, 2017Fires were started everywhere on the streets. Rioters wearing black ski masks and carrying sledge hammers they used to bust out windows of banks and vehicles were roaming the streets as well.None of these threats existed prior to or during Obama s inauguration. It s pretty safe to say that angry Democrats and anarchists roaming the streets looking for trouble didn t make for the most family friendly environment. Many Trump supporters admitted they wouldn t attend the inauguration because they feared violence against them and their children. But the media just glossed over the fear factor created by the Left, and chalked it up to Trump s sudden (according to fake polls)  unpopularity. Here are the propaganda photos used by the media to discredit Trump.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/YysDewDB9N pic.twitter.com/myrXutzMpH  NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) January 21, 2017For the record, here is an actual picture that was taken during Trump s inaugural speech. The mall appears to be jam packed with Trump supporters:Chris Wallace jumped on the mainstream media train this morning and attempted to discredit Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Chris Wallace asked to have the picture comparing Trump and Obama s crowds up on the screen for the viewers to see before confronting  Reince Priebus. Priebus responded,  You re also not saying that that picture was taken before he even began speaking.  Chris Wallace freaks, and asks to have the picture put back up again (which of course doesn t change what Priebus just said).Watch:Fox News  Senior Political Analyst, who also attended the inauguration, tells a much different story than the one Wallace was trying to paint. Perhaps Wallace should have consulted with Hume, since they both work for the same network. Perhaps he should have asked about how the violent protesters affected the number of people who were actually able to make it to the inauguration. To be sure, Brit Hume was no cheerleader for Donald Trump leading up to the election, but at least he had the integrity to tell the truth about the deceitful media s attempt to prove Trump supporters have somehow magically deserted him.I was in the building at the bottom of picture on right yesterday. Shot was taken early, area was considerably fuller by time of speech. https://t.co/bzhWjm4alC  Brit Hume (@brithume) January 22, 2017Brit Hume is also one of the only journalists to point out the seriousness of these violent rioters and says they need to be held responsible for the damage they did to other people s property:""Property damage is not violence""  > Protesters who destroyed property on Inaug.

" Modern Medicine Explains Why Your Desire To Punch Ted Cruz In The Face Is Completely Natural Germans call it Backpfeifengesicht. It s a colloquialism which translated means  a face that needs to be hit.  However, you don t need to be German to want to punch Ted Cruz in the face. While there hasn t been any formal polling on the question, I personally would feel safe wagering money on it being over 50 percent of America. But what does this all mean? Are we a nation of unreasonable bullies for wanting this?Doctor Richard Cytowic has taken some time to explain to America why they are not a nation of bad people for their burning desire to smash a knuckle sandwich into Ted Cruz s jaw. It turns out this is all a very natural and very scientific thing we are experiencing.While I would never actually suggest someone would do something like punch Ted Cruz in the face (I m not suggesting they don t either), the feeling that you want to means you are operating at a normal mental state   so just enjoy the feeling and embrace it within reason.Dr. Cytowic explained that humans learn to read facial expressions from the day they are born. It s one of our most rudimentary and instinctual means of communication. Our brains have had a million years of practice at reading facial expressions, generating an instant like or dislike of the person that they are attached to. To put it more simply, it s an evolutionary survival trait to determine friend from foe, and our brains are extremely good at it by now.With this in mind, it explains a lot about why practically everyone hates Ted Cruz. It isn t just his policy. There are oodles of idiot Republicans we could hate for that same reason. Ted brings out a more visceral and emotional reaction, unlike most others. Even among his fellow Republicans nobody likes him, and that says a lot.Dr. Cytowic goes on to describe how Cruz s facial expressions do not shift the way normal Human expression does. He has rarely observed a normal smile from Ted Cruz. In a normal smile the corners of the mouth go up, and the muscles circling the eyes contract making them narrow and forming crow s feet at the outside corners. When it comes to Ted, his mouth just tightens into a straight line, and on the rare occasion that it deviates from this, the corners bend downward.  The outside of his eyes bend downward as well, which is completely opposite of what is normal, as the eyebrows typically bend upwards.To put it simply, Ted Cruz has a look of disgust on his face that only gets worse when he tries to look happy and smile. It s like he is some kind of anti-politician, because you would think that someone who has his kind of fan base would naturally be able to express themselves more pleasantly. So remember, when you see Ted on TV and you want to throw something at the screen, it means you re ok because it s only natural.Featured image from Twitter ",0
" Bill Maher: Trump’s Orlando Massacre Response Shows America ‘What He Is – A Narcissist’ (VIDEO) Donald Trump s response to the horrific massacre in Orlando   the worst in American history   was nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of expressing condolences, he instead congratulated himself on being right about Muslims and used the tragedy as an opportunity to double down on his bigoted plan to ban Muslims from the United States. HBO s host of Real Time, Bill Maher, wasted no time in ripping Trump a new one on that, and took it a step further and told his viewers what we all already know: Donald Trump is not just an offensive blowhard, he s also an amazing narcissist. Maher began with Trump s racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is  presiding over his Trump University case: The judge thing looked selfish. There is no constituency for Trump University except for Donald Trump. And then the first thing out of his mouth after Orlando was,  I was right.  He looks like what he is   a narcissist. One of Maher s panel members, Business Insider Senior Editor Josh Barro, pointed out that the American people have shown better sense than we realize  when it comes to Trump s ridiculously offensive Twitter brag regarding Orlando. He continued: It turns out Americans don t like blatantly racist attacks on the judiciary that also signal that a president might use his own power to support his businesses and defeat his political opponents through untoward things. And then the response to the shooting. I think there had been this idea that if there was terrorism that it would be good for Trump. Bill Maher went so far as to say that this week ended Trump s White House ambitions: I see it as, this was the week it ended. I don t think I m the only one, because most of the Republicans who were caught on camera this week basically said,  I don t want to talk about it. Of course they don t want to talk about it. What the hell can they say to what Trump gets up to at his rallies and on national television on an almost daily basis? Hell, the man even celebrated his 70th birthday this week by accusing the sitting president of treason. The Republicans who do speak out are the brave ones, such as the former Bush adviser who called him out for what he is   ignorant   after those remarks that suggest that President Obama was a terrorist sympathizer.Hopefully, Maher is right, and this particularly horrible week in Trump Land has effectively squashed any chance he has at ruining America as President Trump.Watch the clip below, via Raw Story:https://youtu.be/nS3Uv8OVC3IFeatured image via video screen capture",1
"LOL! OBAMA WARNS VOTERS Donald Trump Is Unvetted, Unserious…”This is not a reality show” Says the guy who was a Jr. Senator and Community Organizer prior to becoming President of the United States.   And who can forget our  selfie  President?And then there s the famous Nelson Mandela funeral selfie:President Obama skewered Donald Trump on Friday, warning that the Republicans  presumptive nominee isn t serious enough for the presidency, his plans aren t plausible, and his ideas haven t been vetted sufficiently.Let s not forget that when Obama was living in his own little narcissistic world and making a contribution to absolutely no-one Trump was busy creating jobs.Obama continued: He has a long record that needs to be examined. And I think it s important for us ot take seriously the statements he s made in the past,  Obama said.  We are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. These were Obama s first extended comments about Trump since the New York mogul cemented his role as the presumptive GOP nominee on Tuesday night. He spoke in the White House briefing room, using remarks on the economy and a crackdown on tax evasion as an opportunity to air his views. It was clear he expected questions about Trump, and intended to use the appearance to discuss the new phase of the election. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States and what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny,  he said.Via: Dallas Morning NewsSpeaking of  scrutiny :Here is a Breitbart News top ten list of things that Obama has refused to release (a complete list would fill volumes):10. State senate papers. In the 2008 primary, Obama criticized Hillary Clinton for not releasing papers from her eight years as First Lady but failed to produce any papers from his eight years in Springfield.  They could have been thrown out,  he said.9. Academic transcripts. His supposed academic brilliance was a major selling point, but Obama (by his own admission) was a mediocre student. His GPA at Occidental was a B-plus at best, and his entering class at Columbia was weak. Can he prove his merit?8. Book proposal. Obama s literary agent claimed he was  born in Kenya for sixteen years. His original book proposal exists biographer David Maraniss refers to it and seems to have embellished other key details of his life. Yet it has never been released.7. Medical records. In 2000, and again (briefly) in 2008, GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain released thousands of pages of his medical records. Obama, who had abused drugs and continued smoking, merely provided a one-page doctor s note.6. Small-dollar donors. In 2008, the McCain campaign released the names of donors who had contributed less than $200, though it was not required to do so. But the Obama campaign refused, amidst accusations it had accepted illegal foreign contributions.5. The Khalidi tape. In 2003, Obama attended a party for his good friend, the radical Palestinian academic Rashid Khalidi. The event featured incendiary anti-Israel rhetoric. The LA Times broke the story, but has refused to release the tape and so has Obama.4. The real White House guest list. Touting its transparency, the Obama White House released its guest logs but kept many visits secret, and moved meetings with lobbyists off-site. It also refused to confirm the identities of visitors like Bertha Lewis of ACORN.3. Countless FOIA requests. The Obama administration has been described as  the worst  ever in complying with Freedom of Information Act requests for documents. It has also punished whistleblowers like David Walpin, who exposed cronyism in Americorps.2. Health reform negotiations. Candidate Obama promised that health care reform negotiations would be televised on C-SPAN. Instead, there were back-room deals worth millions with lobbyists and legislators the details of which are only beginning to emerge.1. Fast and Furious documents. After months of stonewalling Congress, Attorney General Eric Holder asked President Obama to use executive privilege to conceal thousands of documents related to the deadly scandal and Obama did just that.In addition to the above, Obama and his campaign have lied about many facts about his past his membership in the New Party; his extensive connections with ACORN; and his continued relationship with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright, among other examples. Obama s own memoir is filled with fabrications. And now he is lying about his opponent s honorable record in business. He and the media have no shame.And oh yeah one more thing that we almost forgot:",0
" Elizabeth Warren HUMILIATES Ben Carson During HUD Hearing; Reveals His Intent To Line Trump’s Pockets (DETAILS) Donald Trump has nominated Ben Carson   an idiot in every area except that of brain surgery   to run the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Department. Carson has no experience in urban development, government, real estate, or anything else relating to the job he s trying to be confirmed to do, and therefore has no business being nominated for it. Therefore, his confirmation is   and should be!   especially difficult. Well, have no fear   Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren made sure of that.Senator Warren s first order of business was to make sure that Donald Trump, who is obviously a real estate tycoon, would not benefit from the activities of HUD under Ben Carson. Warren asked of Carson: Can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar you give out will financial benefit the president-elect or his family? Carson could not make that assurance directly, and said that he could only assure that would refuse to play favorites,  continuing: I can assure you that the things that I do are driven by a sense of morals and values. That wasn t good enough for Warren, though, and she pushed Carson further: It s not about your good faith. My concern is whether or not, among the billions of dollars you will be responsible for handing out in grants and loans, can you just assure us that not $1 will go to benefit either the president-elect or his family? Carson said of that question: It will not be my intention to do anything to benefit [Trump]. Since Carson refused to give any direct answers here, Warren drew her own conclusions saying: Do I take that to mean you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the president-elect? Carson insisted: You can take it to mean that I will manage things in a way that benefits the American people. Carson went on to say that he wouldn t directly promise that he wouldn t use Trump s family properties for HUD programs: If there happens to be an extraordinary program that s working for millions of people, and it turns out that someone that you re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say,  No, the rest of you Americans can t have it?  I think logic and common sense probably would be the best way. Warren concluded: The problem is that you can t assure us that HUD money   not of $10 varieties but of multimillion-dollar varieties   will not end up in the president-elect s pockets. And that s just the problem. Donald Trump is surrounding himself with sycophants like Ben Carson, who will use their positions of power to do anything Trump wants   including using federal dollars to line Trump s pockets. If and when this guy is confirmed, we ll literally be paying Donald Trump, via our tax dollars through Ben Carson s HUD Department, to house low-income families.This is shaping up to be the most corrupt administration in modern history.Watch the exchange below:.@SenWarren asks Dr. Ben Carson:  Can you just assure us that not one dollar will go to benefit either the President-elect or his family?  pic.twitter.com/lSyur2AYik  CSPAN (@cspan) January 12, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",0
"NEW BIOGRAPHY Exposes Barack Obama’s Dream Of Becoming Donald Trump Barack Obama s white college girlfriend Sheila Miyoshi Jager, who is now a professor at Oberlin College, tells a story of a very calculating man who was not about to let her race get in the way of his political ambitions: In the winter of  86, when we visited my parents, he asked me to marry him,  she told Garrow. Her parents were opposed, less for any racial reasons (Barack came across to them like  a white, middle-class kid,  a close family friend said) than for concern about Obama s professional prospects, and because her mother thought Sheila, two years Obama s junior, was too young.  Not yet,  Sheila told Barack. But they stayed together.In early 1987, when Obama was 25, she sensed a change.  He became. . . so very ambitious  very suddenly,  she told Garrow.  I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president. Discussions of race and politics suddenly overwhelmed Sheila and Barack s relationship.  The marriage discussions dragged on and on,  but now they were clouded by Obama s  torment over this central issue of his life . . . race and identity,  Sheila recalls. The  resolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,  she said.At Harvard, the Obama the world has come to know took clearer form. In his late 20s now and slightly older than most classmates, he had a compulsion to orate in class and summarize other people s arguments for them.  In law school the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up,  one student told Garrow. Classmates created a Obamanometer, ranking  how pretentious someone s remarks are in class. If Garrow is indeed correct in concluding that Obama s romantic choices were influenced by his political ambitions, it is no small irony that Michelle Obama became one of those most skeptical about Obama s political prospects, and most dubious about his will to rise. She constantly discourages his efforts toward elective office and resents the time he spends away from her and their two young daughters. Obama vented to a friend how often Michelle would talk about money.  Why don t you go out and get a good job? You re a lawyer   you can make all the money we need,  she would tell him, as the couple struggled with student loans and the demands of family and political life. (Garrow sides with Michelle, highlighting how, on the day after Sasha was born, Barack went downtown for a meeting.)As he considered a U.S. Senate bid, Obama s team commissioned a poll that covered, among other questions, his name.  Barry,  as he was known from childhood into his early college years, polled better than  Barack,  but Obama never considered resurrecting the old name. He had made his choice, of identity and image, long ago. Sheila recalls that one of the few times Obama became genuinely angry with her was in Hawaii, when she heard relatives calling him Barry, and she did so as well, just for fun. He became  irrationally furious,  she said.  He told me that under no circumstances was I ever to use that name with him. There was no going back.The sense of destiny is not unusual among those who become president. (See Clinton, Bill.) But it created complications. Obama believed that he had a  calling,  Garrow writes, and in his case it was  coupled with a heightened awareness that to pursue it he had to fully identify as African American. Obama had considered Donald Trump long before either man won the presidency, and brushed off his existence as a misguided national fantasy. Americans have a  continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility,  Obama wrote in the old Harvard book manuscript, now more than 25 years old.  The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American   I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don t make it, my children will.

" Watch Heartbreaking Cries From An Abused Puppy As She Is Shown Love For The First Time (VIDEO) A video of a terrified and previously abused puppy being shown love for the first time by her handler has captured the hearts and minds of many. The puppy, Priscilla, is crying out as a caretaker pets her. Not knowing how to react to the love she s shown for the first time, Priscilla cries out in anguish and fear but as the video progresses, amazing things happen.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogpZHkfN2I]Defenseless and petrified, Priscilla keeps snapping her head back to the hand of the caretaker, anxiously anticipating what the caretaker will do next. Watching Pricilla s trauma gives the viewer an idea of the magnitude of abuse Priscilla previously suffered.However, after a few strokes around her head, eyes, and ears, Priscella slowly yet surely calms. Later on in the video, Priscella is in the arms of her caretaker and she seems both comfortable and reassured that the people around her mean no harm.The last part of the video shows a happy Priscilla playing with her handler and another dog. She is bright, happy, and physically healthy, unlike the Priscilla we saw in the previous video. Not much is known about Priscilla other than the clear abuse she clearly incurred from her previous owner and that she is from Romania.It is striking what a little love and affection can do. If we treated all creatures in this manner, including each other, one can only imagine how wonderful the world we live in would be.Featured Image via YouTube Screen Capture from Daily Mail ",0
"NBC REPORTER Asks Sarah Sanders About Taxes…She Points Directly To Reporter’s Paycheck [Video] Sarah Sanders does it again! The snarky DC reporters always try and get her but she ends up on top every time! This time was no exception;Daily Caller reports:The GOP tax reform bill is the most talked-about thing in the country right now. When NBC asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders about its effects Thursday, Sanders pointed to the huge bonuses many at NBC will be receiving because of the bill.Multiple corporations announced a mix of thousand-dollar bonuses, pay increases and heavy sums of charitable giving in response to the tax cuts.One of those corporations was Comcast-NBCUniversal.Sarah Sanders  made use of the fact that journalists are getting a pay raise under this tax cut, in part because there was so much misinformation about the tax cut in media. CNN s Brian Stelter tweeted the report with this comment last night:Sanders responded to Stelter s comment with this reminder:The left has been tripped up numerous times in the past few days. Chuck Schumer claimed that AT&T employees would suffer because of the tax bill but they came out with a great bonus for employees right after the bill passed in the Senate:Democrats have played the drama queen role calling the tax bill  Armageddon . They will be proven wrong on this even though they pulled out all the stops to try and make tax reform sound bad. MAGA!",1
" Elizabeth Warren Announces That A Major For Profit School Is Banned From Accepting Students If there s one thing Elizabeth Warren hates, it s when ordinary citizens get the wool pulled over their eyes and are taken advantage of by greedy corporations.In an effort to make at least one company no longer have the ability to cheat students out of a proper education and tens of thousands of dollars, ITT Tech will no longer be allowed to accept students.Warren took to Facebook to make the announcement: ITT Tech   a massive, for-profit college   is currently under investigation by 20 state and federal agencies for cheating students. The SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey are all suing them for fraud. ITT Tech failed, again, to meet the scandalously low standards of its accrediting agency, but still sucked down a whopping $600 million in taxpayer dollars last year.Today, the Department of Education has finally declared that enough is enough, banning ITT Tech from enrolling any new students with federal student loan and grant dollars this fall. ITT s free ride is finally over, and the message couldn t be clearer: We will no longer stand by and allow these shady institutions to bilk taxpayers and cheat students. https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/636549976507499Warren also posts a link that explains what is happening and what current students can do or expect. Part of the article explains:As a current ITT student with federal loans, you have some options:You can continue your courses at ITT with your federal student aid. There s no immediate change to your program.You can transfer your credits to a new school (if that school accepts them) and complete your education.You can pause your education and wait to see how this matter resolves itself in the coming months. If ITT closes before you finish your program and you don t transfer your credits, you will likely be eligible to discharge your federal loans.This is huge news, and long overdue. All too often these for-profit schools continue to take money while providing subpar education, often not properly accredited. These schools spend more on advertising than education and take advantage of people who may not necessarily realize they are being robbed.It is wonderful to finally see some justice be made and watch at least another one of these scam schools be given what is long overdue.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",1

" Twitter Goes Ballistic After Trump’s Penis Joke: ‘Some Things You Just Can’t Fact-Check’ (TWEETS) Last night, the Republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size.This happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh GOP debate, when Trump addressed rival Marco Rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring America that there was  no problem with the size of his junk. No one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature, petty discussion   but you can always count on Trump to help the country sink to new lows.While many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state, wallowing over the fact that a nationally-televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke, Twitter swooped in to save the day. As soon as Trump made his ill-timed joke, Twitter was flooded with the most clever, hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much-needed perspective to keep us afloat as Trump continues to dominate the Republican polls.Here are some of the most amazing responses to Trump, to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the GOP debate might actually win the nomination:TwitterTwitterMany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment.TwitterThe New York Post and Huffington Post didn t disappoint:Twitter TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterLast night s GOP debate was less about policy and the future of America than it was about Trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle.

" WATCH: Trump Brags About Himself And Trump Tower During Remarks At United Nations Headquarters It took all of a few seconds for Donald Trump to start bragging about himself during his remarks at the United Nations.Trump World Tower is a residential skyscraper catering primarily to the wealthy.It also happens to be across the street from the United Nations Headquarters where the General Assembly is meeting this week and where Trump spoke on Monday morning.Predictably, Trump began his remarks by bragging about the building and himself. Thank you very much. Thank you. I actually saw great potential right across the street to be honest with you,  Trump began.  And it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project. So, I want to thank you, Ambassador Haley for your introduction and your steadfast advocacy for American interests on the world stage. Here s the video via Twitter.Pres. Trump on luxury residential property by UN: United Nations being there was reason  that turned out to be such a successful project.  pic.twitter.com/kid9STah3W  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 18, 2017So, Trump can t even stop being a narcissist for one day to address the distinguished diplomats and representatives of the United Nations.It should be noted that New Yorkers strongly opposed the construction of Trump World Tower in the late 1990s, including legendary journalist Walter Cronkite.Basically, Trump robbed the neighborhood of their view of the East River and Long Island by placing a big ugly tower in front of it so that only wealthy people staying in his building could enjoy it. Residents were also concerned that the big ugly building would dwarf the more aesthetically pleasing United Nations Headquarters, which it did.Trump is nothing more than a cheap salesman who is more interested in touting his real estate ventures than he is in promoting international peace and cooperation. That s incredibly sad.Once again, Trump embarrassed himself and America on the world stage. And those were just his opening remarks. Just imagine how much more he will embarrass our country before he is done speaking. The United States is going to be an even bigger joke on the international stage than we have ever been.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
"DEMOCRAT MOCKS AMERICANS For Believing ‘Climate Change’ Is Part Of Obamatrade: Two Weeks Later…Obama Announces ‘Climate Change’ Is Part of Obamatrade Not that it matters, but since it appears that no one has read the bill, it s probably not that unlikely that Democrat senator Ron Wyden misspoke In a speech on the Senate floor on May 22, Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon ridiculed those who thought climate change regulation would be part of Obamatrade:We ve heard suggested, for example, that it s a backdoor route to immigration reform or action on climate change . My sense is that the rate these hypotheticals are going, you re bound to hear that a future president working on a trade deal might have second thoughts about the Louisiana purchase.But in an interview on NPR s Marketplace yesterday (June 3), President Obama said that enforcing climate change regulations will indeed be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obamatrade pact that he is currently negotiating with Malaysia and 10 other countries. He said:If we want to solve something like climate change, which is one of my highest priorities, then I ve got to be able to get into places like Malaysia, and say to them, this is in your interest. What leverage do I have to get them to stop deforestation? Well part of the leverage is if I m in a trade relationship with them that allows me to raise standards.In December, Obama will negotiate a multi-country climate agreement in Paris. We already know from Obama s joint announcement with China that he will commit the United States to a huge reduction in carbon emissions of 26%-28% from 2005 levels, but he will let China, already a much larger carbon emitter, continue to expand its carbon emissions until 2030.Via: American Thinker",1

" Republicans In Congress Want To Give Donald Trump Unrestricted War Powers If Donald Trump becomes president, you better prepare for World War III, because if Republicans have their way, their presumptive nominee will have unprecedented power to wage war across the globe without restrictions from Congress.Throughout his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump has bragged that he  wants to have a much stronger military  so strong that nobody is going to mess with us.  Of course, that means increased military spending that is completely unnecessary because we already have the top military in the world and we spend more on our military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, England, India, and Germany combined. In fact, we could slash our military spending in half and would still spend more than any other nation.Graph courtesy of Peter G. Peterson FoundationBut Republicans are gunning to keep military spending at monstrous levels and they are willing to give Trump unprecedented and unlimited war power.Earlier this year, Senate Republicans introduced a new Authorization for Use of Military Force that would authorize presidents to wage war anywhere anytime without having to ask Congress for a declaration of war as the Constitution requires.According to Huffington Post:[The AUMF] would give the president new authority to take action against the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. It wouldn t put any limits on the duration, geography or use of U.S. ground combat troops in the war, or on the means by which the U.S. military could act. It also would keep in place a broad AUMF from 2001 that never expired and that allows the president to take military action against anyone, anywhere, connected to the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks.In other words, Donald Trump would have complete power to go to war whenever he wants against whomever he wants and Republican lawmakers are just fine with that because they don t want the responsibility of making war decisions. I don t like the idea of telling a commander-in-chief they can t go where ISIL goes, they re limited by time, geography and means,  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said.  If I don t like the time, geography or means, I can cut off funding. Alabama GOP Rep. Mike Rogers thinks Donald Trump would  be an improvement  over President Obama, who has used diplomacy effectively in his foreign policy agenda while limiting his own war strategy to air strikes and predator drone strikes rather than sending thousands of American troops to war.South Carolina GOP Rep. Joe Wilson thinks  we need to finish what we started,  and he is totally okay with Donald Trump controlling the military because he suggested Trump will also try to work with the terrorists, too.Senator Chuck Grassley said he would comfortable with Trump as long as he  has a plan,  and Arizona GOP Rep. Trent Franks wants Trump to  advocate the maintenance and strength of a military capable of dealing with the growing threats to freedom this world faces  and  dismiss the practice of Mr. Obama of emboldening our enemies and disheartening our friends. That s basically code meaning that Trump should rip up the nuclear deal with Iran to reduce their nuclear material and attack them instead even though the deal is working.Trump has already declared his disapproval of the deal. He also said in 2011 that America should use  any and all means necessary  to stop Iran s nuclear program, which includes military force.Republicans are already itching for a war against Iran. A President Trump could give them one unilaterally.Trump has also suggested in his book The America We Deserve that he would use force against North Korea, which would guarantee a new Korean War.[In a Trump presidency], North Korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice. I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Ghadhafi in 1986. I don t think anybody is going to accuse me of tiptoeing through the issues or tap-dancing around them either. Who else in public life has called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea?Trump has also not been secretive about the fact that he wants to bring back the use of torture and commit war crimes against civilian populations in the effort to defeat terrorists.That s scary enough, but consider this.As president, Donald Trump would also have control over the nation s nuclear arsenal. And he has already refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and the Middle East.In short, a President Trump could usher in a nuclear Armageddon and Congress has absolutely no problem with this.If Trump somehow defeats Hillary Clinton in November and Republicans retain control of the Senate and the House, we could see World War III as the thin-skinned businessman in the White House responds to the smallest of slights or Republican prodding with military strikes that could spill the blood of thousands of American soldiers and put the country further into debt.That is what is at stake in this election so let s hope people start taking this seriously.Featured image via Flickr ",0

He described the loss of the information as a  historic act of devastating incompetence. More on this report from RT  RTWikiLeaks will give tech companies which suffered  billions of dollars of damage  when hacked by the CIA  exclusive access  to its technical expertise, founder Julian Assange revealed at a press conference.Speaking in a livestream Thursday, Assange said the leaked information originated from an isolated computer, separated from others in the network, at CIA headquarters in Virginia, describing the loss of the information as an historic act of devastating incompetence.  READ MORE: WikiLeaks says just 1% of #Vault7 covert documents released so farRaising questions over whether the loss of the information was known to former US President Barack Obama or current president Donald Trump before being revealed by WikiLeaks, Assange also questioned if the loss had been shared with companies such as Apple and Google, which were made vulnerable by it. Potentially billions of dollars of damage  has been done by the CIA to tech companies, Assange said, adding trust has been damaged by the revelations, in both the US government and US exports. He later added that some of the fixes to devices exposed as vulnerable by the leak would be quickly fixed but others, including smart TVs, would be more difficult and take longer to fix. WikiLeaks has a lot more information,  Assange said, adding that  we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out.

It is an unusual time in the United States to see an intelligence agency so heavily involved in domestic politics,  Assange said, when asked if the CIA was experiencing turmoil within its ranks.When questioned about redactions, Assange said 78,000 pieces of information were withheld, consisting of IP addresses of both target and attack machines.

After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
"ERIC BOLLING Accuser Is Serial Sexual Harassment Accuser, P*ssy-Hat Wearing, Trump-Hating, Left-Wing Activist Professor Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers   two at Fox Business and one at Fox News.Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News  top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes. The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with  some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country  after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com   Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly  filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure,  according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network. Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her. [Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have  fun.  He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go,  Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex. Bolling s team is denying the accusations. Heldman s social media profiles show her to be a staunch left-wing feminist activist.  Big League PoliticsMany brought up #pizzagate in response to my ""good people don't vote for rapists"" sign at Trump's inauguration. https://t.co/lTDtBEhhgh pic.twitter.com/T2S8UfIF5O  Caroline Heldman (@carolineheldman) June 22, 2017Seriously though, the fact that accuser Caroline Heldman would use a picture of themselves with the pal and high-profile, media whore lawyer Gloria Allred at the top of their Twitter account is pretty interesting.Here is Caroline Heldman s Twitter profile:Social media users attempted to accuse Michelle Fields of being one of the women accusing Bolling of sexual harassment. She quickly came to Bolling s defense:False. Im not one of the women in @yashar's story & Eric Bolling was nothing but professional when I worked w/ him.

"SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Goes All Creepy Predicting The 2016 Election: “Everything is up for grabs” What the heck is wrong with these loony liberal political hack Supreme Court justices? We had a proclamation from Latina Sotomayor that white men couldn t possibly know what it s like to be a minority huh?  Now we have Ruth  Buzzy  Ginsburg saying that if Hillary doesn t win then  everything is up for grabs . She also put in a plug for a pro-Hillary presidency saying she doesn t want to think about a Trump presidency. What the heck is up with these supposedly unbiased people who should not be speaking out politically. All the more reason to vote for Trump to make the court more conservative just to piss off the political hags hacks on the court WASHINGTON   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she doesn t want to think about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the White House, and she predicts the next president    whoever she will be    will have a few appointments to make to the Supreme Court.In an interview Thursday in her court office, the 83-year-old justice and leader of the court s liberal wing said she presumes Democrat Hillary Clinton will be the next president. Asked what if Republican Donald Trump won instead, she said,  I don t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs. That includes the future of the high court itself, on which she is the oldest justice. Two justices, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, are in their late 70s. It s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,  Ginsburg said, smiling.She didn t sound as though she is preparing to step down soon and shows no signs of slowing down. Ginsburg said she has been catching up on sleep since the court finished its work last week before a busy summer of travel that will take her to Europe and, as is her custom, to see as much opera as she can fit in.In the wide-ranging interview, Ginsburg reviewed the just-ended term during which she lost her best friend on the court and, partly as a result, was on the winning side of most of the high-profile cases. Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, depriving his conservative allies of a reliable vote and leaving eight justices to decide nearly five dozen cases.President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the ninth seat, but Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing or vote on Garland s nomination, arguing the next president should have the right to name Scalia s replacement. Even if the Senate were to confirm Garland after the election, the court probably would hear three months of cases without him, Ginsburg said.And if there s no action in a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress, the vacancy could last the entire term, she said.She said court majorities this term moved to shut down tactics used by opponents of abortion and of affirmative action in higher education in two major cases.Ginsburg said she doesn t expect to see any more such cases after the court upheld the use of race in college admissions in Texas and struck down Texas abortion-clinic regulations that the state said were needed to protect patients. It seemed to me it was a sham to pretend this was about a woman s health,  rather than about making it harder to get an abortion, Ginsburg said.She disputed reports that the court is taking on only relatively unimportant cases while waiting for a ninth justice. It isn t so. We haven t selected them with a view to dodging challenging cases. We take them as they come to us,  she said.Via: CBS",0
" Former GOP Policy Chief Unleashes AMAZING Tweetstorm After ‘Fragile’ Trump Cries About Jeff Flake Arizona Senator Jeff Flake can t vote for Donald Trump. He said so on CNN. He won t vote for Hillary, either (boo), but he also can t make himself vote for someone as full of pond scum as Trump.

In his blog post about Trump s ridiculous attack on Flake, he fleshes out some of his tweets a little better: But Donald Trump is a weak, fragile, and petulant man who cannot stomach dissent or criticism.

"MOCKINGBIRD REDUX? CNN’s Role in Peddling Fake ‘Nothing Burger’ Russia-Gate News Revealed 21st Century Wire says CNN has reportedly refused to punish one of its senior producers John Bonifield, after a recent Project Veritas video sting operation exposed the network s role in peddling a fake Russia-gate narrative just for ratings. As if that wasn t enough of a network crisis, CNN s Van Jones was also caught in a new Veritas video sting release stating that the mainstream media s long-running  Russian collusion  story is a  big nothing burger. This latest twin expos comes after three prominent writers from CNN were  urged to resign  (fired) after the network was threatened with an estimated $100 million dollar lawsuit (something which 21WIRE predicted) earlier this week following a bogus story (since retracted) that falsely linked political figure and financier Anthony Scaramucci to a Russian investment fund currently under a congressional probe.NOTE: CNN and other big media outlets have been pushing a vast Russian conspiracy for nearly a year and now those at CNN are brushing off the narrative after being caught in an ongoing deception   MEDIA MOCKERY    Senior CNN producer John Bonifield was caught in a video sting admitting that the Trump-Russia narrative was untrue and Van Jones further confirmed the network s position. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for almost a year, and even more conveniently over this past 2016 US presidential election cycle, before morphing into the dodgy dossier that included unverified Trump-Russia claims. Incredibly, the still as of yet unsubstantiated Russia-Trump collusion story briefly vanished, only to be newly reignited again, after two US military missile strikes in Syria and Afghanistan took place following the fabricated sarin chemical attack allegations in April which the White House claimed hit the Al Nusra-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria.Just this week, the US government warned (a story peddled by CNN among others) of an upcoming, soon-to-be-released alleged  chemical attack  out of Syria, something which would potentially prompt another wag the dog theatrical bombing from the US-led Coalition. Is this false flag foreshadowing by Washington?Perhaps such plans may have been scarpered by a blistering report detailing false sarin claims concerning the Idlib province by award-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh only days ago. Hersh s report, appropriately titled  Trump s Red Line confirmed much of what we at 21WIRE managed to outline in the aftermath of the alleged chemical attack, while also condemning the lack of clear evidence and reactionary military response by the Trump administration even after Russia shared deconfliction intelligence with the US.The fallout from the sarin hoax and CNN Russia-gate spin has also been compounded by an embarrassing retraction from the NY Times over their Russian hack/influence claims said to be confirmed by 17 US intelligence agencies   a story which once again turned out to be a falsehood as recently discussed by well-known investigative reporter Robert Parry.  SARIN HOAX    It s official now, the alleged Syrian chemical attack story was a false narrative that Western media outlets gleefully lapped up. (Image Source: cnn)Propaganda 3.0Here is where the propaganda goes into overdrive.Suddenly, as if by coincidence (or right on cue) Reuters reports that Syria has  heeded  its warning, almost immediately after Hersh s stirring investigative effort laid bare many elements of April s sarin hoax in Syria. That s right: because it issued a warning based on secret intelligence that no one is allowed to see, Washington is somehow claiming credit for stopping a chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime.As both the Russian and Syria narratives continue to crumble, an awkwardness has set in for CNN and the Trump Administration (its Syria policy duly inherited from the Obama Administration)   both of whom have relied on these narratives to prop-up dysfunctional US foreign policy agendas.The recent CNN video sting revelations weakens the already questionable Russian collusion plot line, something which we ve covered extensively here at 21WIRE. In fact, following the highly dubious DDoS attacks in America in October of 2016, we made the following accurate assessment: Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer [of 2016], the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof. Here s a newer Project Veritas video exposing CNN s Van Jones admitting there s no evidence to back-up the Russian conspiracy story Here s another look at the recent Project Veritas video exposing CNN producer John Bonfield admitting the network has pushed a false Russian collusion meme As the Project Veritas series continues, CNN Associate Producer Jimmy Carr disclosed the political bias pushed by the network QUESTION: Why has CNN been peddling Russian collusion allegations without any evidence?It s not just for ratings The new Project Veritas video stings provide more evidence of an overtly political agenda, something we saw throughout the 2016 US presidential election. In fact, the entire video expos  is reminiscent of Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners being caught discussing how to commit large-scale voter fraud, while also apparently outlining how to incite violence at campaign rallies. Unbelievably in the year leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, Creamer met with White House officials some 342 times along with his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff,  in the year leading up to the election.Furthermore, the Russia-gate plot line perpetuated by CNN immediately recalls the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media seen during the Cold War era. In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird that was said to have infiltrated the American news media in particular, which propagandized the public through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups. Is the recent CNN fallout more evidence confirming that a modern version of Operation Mockingbird is alive and well?In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as confirmed by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year. There has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years from big media, despite claims that the NDAA provision offered more transparency to the American public.More from RT below THE FIX    John Bonifield admitted that CNN s Russia collusion narrative is not based on evidence. (Image Source rt)CNN stands behind its producer caught in sting video, says he won t be punishedRTCNN has backed one of its senior producers caught in a Project Veritas sting video, saying the company encourages diversity of personal opinions. John Bonifield was filmed admitting the network s craze over alleged Trump-Russia collusion is  bullsh*t. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong, we welcome it and embrace it,  an email from a CNN spokesman to the Daily Beast reads.  CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield,  it said.CNN Health supervising producer Bonifield, who is not involved in the channel s political coverage, was videotaped saying the company does not have any evidence to support its Russia-Trump narrative, driven mostly by the desire for ratings. It s mostly bullsh*t right now. Like, we don t have any big giant proof,  the CNN producer can be heard saying in the video, adding that US President Donald Trump is  probably right  to accuse them of a conducting a witch-hunt.This story continues at RT READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesREAD MORE ON THE WHITE HELMETS AT: 21st Century Wire White Helmet FilesREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",0

Valedictorian Stepped Up To Podium After ATHEIST Group Told Grads They Could No Longer Recite The Lord’s Prayer A 70-year tradition at East Liverpool High School was removed from the graduation ceremony, but students weren t letting it go easily.The Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation, which advocates for separation of church and state, got wind of the school s prayer tradition. They told East Liverpool administrators they needed to stop their choir from singing the Lord s Prayer at graduation.Rather than fighting legal battles, the school removed the song from Sunday s program. But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change. I know a lot of my student body was uncomfortable with it, just because it is tradition to have prayer at our school,  said Cami Post, class of 2016 vice president. The idea of one person or 2 or 3 standing up and saying they don t want prayer back in school or even singing or reciting is sad,  said Pastor Rodney Ohler, Salineville Assembly of God.Ohler and members of his church stood outside to support keeping the prayer in school.

"CHRISTIAN HIGH SCHOOL Told By State They Are No Longer Allowed To Pray Before Games The drip drip drip of communism Leftists are stealing our rights and freedom while Americans can t be bothered with  politics  because they re too busy watching the Kardashians The Florida High School Athletics Association recently denied a request by two Christian schools to broadcast a prayer before a championship game at Orlando s Citrus Bowl Stadium.Cambridge Christian School in Tampa and the University Christian School out of Jacksonville are playing in the District 2-A high school football championships today and coaches from both teams submitted a request to ensure a 30-second prayer over the loudspeaker before kickoff, Bay News 9 reports.But Roger Dearing, director of the Florida High School Athletics Association, denied the request for two main reasons. The facility is a public facility, predominantly paid for with public tax dollars, makes the facility  off limits  under federal guidelines and precedent court cases,  Dearing wrote in an emailed response to the teams.  In Florida Statutes, the FHSAA (host and coordinator of the event) is legally a  State Actor,  we cannot legally permit or grant permission for such an activity. Cambridge head of school Tim Euler doesn t agree with Dearing s ruling. We ve played 13 football games this year,  he told Bay News 9  We ve prayed before every one of them. Here s the problem,  Euler told WTSP.  The Florida Legislature is opened up with prayer in a building that is paid by tax dollars. What is the difference? If they can pray there, we can pray here, and I want them to be able to pray there and I want us to be able to pray here,  he added.  So I think (Dearing s) reasoning is flawed at the core of it. Euler said Friday morning, hours before the game s 1 p.m. start time, that it s unlikely the teams would be able to reverse the decision, but believes it s important to highlight the problem, nonetheless. What we really want to do is raise awareness,  he told Bay News 9.  All we re asking for is an opportunity for two Christian schools to pray. WTSP attempted to contact the Florida High School Athletic Association about the ruling, but the agency ignored its request.WTSP reporter Mike Deeson posted about the controversy on Facebook. I was disappointed the Florida High School Athletic Association didn t return our calls,  he wrote.  I wanted to know how the legislature opens with a prayer in a taxpayer owned building with state employees, yet FHSAA maintains a prayer couldn t be said in a taxpayer funding facility the Citrus Bow that was sanctioned by state employees, members of FHSAA. Something doesn t make sense when you compare the two   but they NEVER returned our calls,  Deeson posted.  In my opinion that was a BAD PR MOVE! Readers, of course, were enraged by the FHSAA s decision. I think it s absolutely ridiculous that they will not let two Christian schools pray before their game,  Mary Salvatore posted to Facebook.  And you wonder why we have so many mass shootings across the country! So PC and so tolerant that you become intolerant,  Robert Rosengarten added.  Let them pray, who gives a f. If they want to pray to Jesus, Allah, the flying spaghetti monster, let them, who cares. Who s to stop them?  Daniel Suarez questioned.  What if both teams come together before the game and pray? What if all in the stands begin to pray? Who would it hurt?  Via: EAG News",1

Friday aftrn standard Dem fake news time pic.twitter.com/8qpi4tnGwL  NeuroTrade (@neurotrade) January 6, 2017The whole series of events is strange to say the least, but the oddities didn t stop there. Santiago-Ruiz s US military background includes service in the Puerto Rico Army National Guard in 2007, according to the Department of Defense. Santiago-Ruiz was listed as a combat engineer who had been deployed to Iraq in April 2010, returning to US soil in 2011. Later in November of 2014, following a move to Alaska, he became a member of the Alaska National Guard. In August of 2016, Santiago-Ruiz was transferred to Inactive Ready Reserve.Additionally, Santiago-Ruiz was stated to be employed by an as of yet unnamed Anchorage security company while living in Alaska.According to the Associated Press and Miami s local CBS News affiliate,  The Pentagon said he [Santiago-Ruiz] went AWOL several times as a specialist during a stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted to private first class, the Associated Press reported. He was given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge. Earlier reports stated that Santiago-Ruiz flew on a flight from Canada. Air Canada promptly denied that the suspected airport shooter was on any of their flights. Other US mainstream outlets later stated that he arrived on an in-bound Delta Airlines flight instead.

Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running.  Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017Another Known Wolf?As 21 WIRE has documented over the years, many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place. A place where a  lone wolf  graduates into the ranks of a known wolf. In fact, very often those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell-tale signs of a patsy or an informant, working either for a law enforcement or intelligence agency. Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various role in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide actors in an actual attacks.  In any case, alleged attackers and security agencies have a dicey relationship, making any link between them highly suspect in nature.In January of 2015, a strategic security service think-tank known as The Soufan Group, reported that a larger national security threat resides with radicals who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies: The Soufan Group, a New York think tank, said a better term for  lone wolves  would be  known wolves , given how many are already known to Western intelligence agencies before they strike. These individuals, acting alone or in small groups   have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations, highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism,  it said in a report this week The Fort Lauderdale shooting story rapidly emerged out of corporate media halls looking to sell the public on the latest tragic shooting in America. The Hollywood International Airport shooting has elements of other high-profile shooting events in recent history, such as the TSA/LAX shooting, the the Tucson shooting, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, the San Bernardino shooting attack, the Chattanooga military base shooting siege, as well as the aspects of the Aurora theater shooting and the Grand theater shooting in Lafayette and many others.Is the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter another case of a known wolf   triggered into action?The apparent Fort Lauderdale airport shooter, Santiago-Ruiz, who is said to be Puerto Rican was born in New Jersey (living in Alaska), and was well-known to authorities, having recently undergone a mental health evaluation after allegedly visiting an FBI office in Alaska where he claimed he was under  CIA mind control,  with voices in his head telling him to join ISIS : They say last November, he walked into the FBI s office in Anchorage, Alaska, claiming that  his mind was being controlled by the CIA and that it was forcing him to join ISIS. He appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements   and although he said he didn t wish to hurt anyone, agents were concerned by his erratic behavior and decided to call local authorities, a senior federal law enforcement official said.Local police took him to a local medical facility for evaluation, and the FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews with family members, the official said. NEW: In Nov. 2016, FLL suspect walked into FBI office in Anchorage, claiming he was being forced to fight for ISIS, sources tell CBS News.  CBS News (@CBSNews) January 6, 2017Shades of the Manchurian Candidate?We re also told that the suspect s aunt had flagged his mentally unstable condition previously. According to USA Today:Yet the troubling episode is now part of an emerging profile of a deeply disturbed man described by his aunt Friday as someone who had  lost his mind. Maria Luisa Ruiz of Union City, N.J., said her nephew, who had moved to Alaska for work as a security guard, only recently began to show signs of instability. Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,  she said He said he saw things. The inclusion of Santiago-Ruiz s alleged  voices  in his head, supposedly triggered by the CIA, immediately recalls another bizarre case that was also difficult to comprehend   the Navy Yard Shooter from 2013.Here s a passage from a 21WIRE report discussing the apparent Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis: Rather than get caught up in the  fear campaigns  sold to us by our favorite news anchor-zombies, its important to consider another aspect of these mass shootings by making a tally of  the trigger points that media uses to manipulate public perception, as they carefully propagandize certain elements within a crisis making sure to illicit  the right  reaction from every major demographic. Is this what we are seeing in the aftermath of the Fort Lauderdale shooting?Heavy.com added the following details about the supposedly troubled Santiago-Ruiz:The shooter   whose troubled behavior had already drawn the attention of the FBI, Army, and Anchorage police   arrived Friday afternoon at the busy airport on a flight from Alaska, with the gun used in the shooting properly stored in his checked baggage, NBC News reports.One report said the shooter, who lived in Alaska, had no other luggage but the gun, which federal rules allow a person to declare at a ticket counter and check under the plane but not carry on. In addition to Santiago-Ruiz s lengthy time with the US military and the National Guard, in recent years, the suspected shooter was involved in various crimes. Here s a passage from The Daily Beast describing some of Santiago s background: According to charging documents provided by the Anchorage prosecutor s office to The Daily Beast, on January 10, 2016, Santiago verbally assaulted his then girlfriend, a 40-year old mother of one child from a previous marriage whom The Daily Beast is not naming, through a locked bathroom door, telling her to  Get the fuck out, bitch.  After he forced his way in by breaking down the door, he smacked her in the head and strangled her. By the time police arrived, Santiago had fled the scene.Santiago was arrested days later and released on the condition that he have no contact with the victim, but in February, Anchorage police found him at his girlfriend s residence and he was charged for violating the conditions of his release. That case is still pending.Alaska court records show a criminal record under Santiago s name for minor traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without insurance and a broken taillight. Records also show his landlord evicted him for non-payment of rent in February 2015.The assault case was resolved in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, an alternative to adjudication where prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for Esteban s completion of requirements, the details of which are unknown. While Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Daily Beast that previous charges against Santiago-Ruiz are unlikely to be dropped following the airport shooting   you still have to wonder what  requirements  were asked of Santiago-Ruiz to get the alleged assault charges dropped from his record in the first place, given the brutal nature of them.FOX NEWS echoes a Sun Sentinel report,  Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the Sun Sentinel reported.The same FOX report adds the following about Santiago-Ruiz s alleged lengthy mental health battle: Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. We have not talked for the past three weeks,  Bryan Santiago said.  That s a bit unusual   I m in shock. He was a serious person   He was a normal person. Mass Shooting Distraction?Another aspect to these highly emotive and polarizing known wolf shooting events, is that usually they dominate US media coverage for several days. As other charged elements of an alleged shooter/attacker are propagandized, such as Santiago-Ruiz s Palestinian scarf image (seen on the left) seized upon by FOX News anchors who fused Santiago-Ruiz s allegedly  ISIS-like  hand gesture with the Gaza-Israeli conflict.The shocking scene at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport occurred the same exact day US intelligence leaders briefed President-elect Donald Trump on so-called Russian hack allegations in the lead up to the 2016 election.Back in September of 2016, while examining the aftermath of the New York and New Jersey bomb plot/attack, we analyzed whether a deeper social engineering agenda might have been at play   as part of a larger geopolitical drama unfolded in Syria appeared to be masked by media.When looking deeper, we discovered other overlapping stories that coincided alongside the  known wolf  NYC bomber. Here s a passage that discussed the NYC attack that seemed to bury Western coverage regarding a vicious airstrike campaign that killed dozens of members of Syria s army: You have to wonder, were the events in New York and New Jersey also a weapon of mass distraction, following a major international embarrassment for the United States both at home and abroad   the brutal airstrike campaign in Syria that killed over 70 Syrian troops? This unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the UN General Assembly in NYC, where President Obama was delivering among other speeches, his War on Terror  addresses to the international community. No surprise then, with the city suddenly on  high terror alert    that Obama quickly, confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the UN, shifting into  national security  mode   boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case. It was almost if he was ready for events that weekend. Similarly, you have to consider if this new high-profile shooting event at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport will dominate the news cycle, as the US intelligence community scrambles to prove Russian hack allegations over the next week.On January 4th ABC News reported the following: The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia s alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News.President-elect Donald Trump, who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA.U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. Interestingly, other explosive high-profile stories went to the back burner, such as the Chicago kidnapping and teen torture story  and the fallout from CNN s Don Lemon following his egregious comments after the tragic racially motivated attack.Media Memory: Reports of a  Second Shooter  at Terminal 1During the later hours of the US mainstream media coverage, networks like CNN were still floating the possibility of a second shooter, as reports emerged of shots fired in the adjacent terminal housing United Airlines, Terminal 1.Interestingly, local reports also reported eye-witness accounts of a  second gunman  involved in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. Here s a passage from an ABC News affiliate discussing the reports of a second gunman at the Fort Lauderdale shooting: All day I ve heard people talking about second incidences,  Catie Rutledge wrote on Instagram.  After waiting on the tarmac for hours and hunting someone down to get our bags, we are now waiting for a bus, so that we can leave the airport. There was panic when authorities feared there was a second gunman. Law enforcement asked travelers to seek shelter. Fear prompted many to say their final good byes to loved ones. Some frightened parents were in tears as they tried to protect their children. This aspect of the case seemingly disappeared from media outlets following Santiago-Ruiz s arrest.The phenomena of multiple shooters being immediately reported after an apparent mass shooting event was also echoed during both the Orlando nightclub shooting and the San Bernardino attack in 2015.Later in the evening, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel confirmed that there was no second shooter   despite previous reports. The suspect was being interrogated by the FBI. This statement was in stark contrast to multiple witness statements made on national TV, placing the series of shots, or perhaps an additional series of shots and subsequent crowds fleeing in panic at Terminal 1  that would either be instead of Terminal 2, or in addition to it. This wasn t just an anomaly   this was backed up by at least 2 different witnesses on CNN, perhaps more in other reports which 21WIRE has yet to collate here.Was this a case of something that happened in Terminal 1  either part of a drill, or another gunman   which was memory-holed by the media and DHS, or could this be we are looking at planted witnesses who got their lines wrong? This is a fair question to ask, considering we are talking about multiple witnesses stating the shots and crowds panicking in Terminals other than the official story in Terminal 2.Here are four alternative witnesses:Witness 1: CNN s coverage of the  Active Shooter  festival at Fort Lauderdale Airport reveals yet another anomaly in their story. CNN reported the alleged shooter, Esteban Santiago, shot 5 people dead in the Delta Terminal 2, and yet, all the witnesses reported 4 shots fired in the United Terminal 1. When this witness, a father who flew in from Chicago, tells of the United T1 shots fired, CNN s reporter Boris Sanchez appears to panic, possibly then receiving a feed in his ear and then essentially tells the witness  you are wrong, there were no shots fired in United Terminal 1.  Was this bad reporting, or bad stage management by CNN? Watch:  Witness 2: Immediately after CNN s Boris Sanchez mix-up with man flying in from Chicago at United Terminal 1, another CNN witness was suddenly produced, going by the name of  Ryan Ward , interviewed by Jim Sciutto, then comes on, using very scripted language apparently in an attempt to clean-up the inconsistent statements of the last witness. Ryan Ward describes the mayhem, people running,  luggage flying  and  people screaming, gunman coming    even though he admits he was NOT in Delta Terminal 2 where police report the actual shooting took place. Ward claims he was in a wheel chair because of back surgery, but then claims he  got up and ran over  to save a little girl and  I ran back over and pushed the mom into a corner and laid on top of her . He then says that,  It does sound like it was an unsubstantiated second threat, but people certainly weren t acting like it    here he was mirroring the identical language used by the previous CNN reporters. Coincidence? Even more oddly, Ward claims he was flying Jet Blue, and that the,  Jet Blue staff were really great    only problem is that Jet Blue is in Terminal 3, and not in T1 or T2. Watch: Witness 3: Another witness, testifying multiple gunman on the scene, although the Terminal location being referenced by this 3rd witness is somewhat unclear:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhiSblZtJs . Also, there is an additional media report by Intellihub of a pilot, in uniform and on-site, who also testifies about a loud commotion, with police in pursuit of a perpetrator seen in Terminal 1   a stark contrast to the official story: The pilot believes that  there was another shooting  in Terminal 1 that law enforcement and the F.B.I. are likely covering up.  I could hear females screaming and people running away from terminal 1. The pilot said he feels that it was definitely  some kind of combined effort to attack  the airport.In addition to that, here is a fifth witness, seen in this unconfirmed cell phone video from a female passenger out on the airport tarmac   apparently from Terminal 1, and referencing a second shooter event located after the TSA barrier   which seems to be a different location to the baggage check area:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tayCW0pTBF8 . EDITORS NOTE: If readers have any other witness reports of a  Second Shooter  or shots fired in Terminal 2, please leave them below in the comment section.Here s an ABC News feature with Mark Lea, an apparent eye-witness (later photographed the crime scene) who came  face-to-face  with Santiago-Ruiz   who also rather incredibly, managed to not get shot during the encounter Fort Lauderdale s  Active Shooter  DrillsVery often preceding an apparent shooting/attack there is the presence of mass casualty drills. Fort Lauderdale was no exception.In 2015, the Sun Sentinel reported the following: At a Fort Lauderdale cinema Wednesday, two men in camouflage gear calmly walked down the aisle and fired rifles and handguns at moviegoers.Twenty-seven volunteers were  injured  in three theaters during the drill.Fort Lauderdale police guarded and escorted paramedics wearing protective gear to tend to the wounded actors, even though the  shooters  weren t captured and blank gunfire echoed elsewhere in the Riverwalk movie complex.The agencies  goal is to speed up paramedics  responses during mass killings, domestic calls and other violent incidents. Similarly, in June of 2016, an inter-agency meeting described future protocols regarding mass drills: The meeting, held every quarter, is an opportunity for agencies to coordinate with one another and discuss the latest techniques in fighting domestic terror attacks.Last month, agencies participated in an active-shooter exercise at the Fort Lauderdale Postal Facility.In February, the group participated in Operation Heat Shield, consisting of weapons of mass destruction and an active shooting drill.Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County Sheriff s Office and Sheriff Rick Bradshaw of Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office said these training exercises are important. With such a large law enforcement effort to tackle the active-shooter, you have to wonder why and how these events seem to coincide with major attacks on US soil.Here s a YouTube video from commentator Peekay Truth discussing aspects of this latest mass shooting tragedy in America https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYY0EgDRYgcDupes, Informants and PawnsAdditionally, as we ve mentioned before, during the aftermath of 2014 s Canadian Parliament Shooting in Ottawa, we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events globally and other mass casualty incidents often seen in America.The shocking event, like other bizarre attacks in recent years, have often distorted public opinion, pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized crimes.The suspected Parliament Hill and National War Memorial shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, (Left Image: therightscoop) had the perfect  modus operandi  and r sum  to be an informant for either a law enforcement or intelligence agency.According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security services   who had also seized his passport. Was this the reason why the Zehaf-Bibeau snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant?Other terror stooges and suspicious intelligence  informant  cases include the following:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal  (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar  (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa  (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here)As we ve mentioned here at 21WIRE before, many political leaders and media operatives bang the drums of security over so-called terror  sleeper cells hiding in a nation near you   none of them acknowledge the historical fact that they themselves have also helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through counter-terrorism operations for decades.It is important to mention again, that the FBI created the counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO) to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out. Between 1956 and 1971 (including the Socialist Workers party in 1973), the FBI s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America.As we stated after the suspicious Oregon campus shooting in 2015, mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event, as they have with many others incidents. The Fort Lauderdale shooting appears once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of items (in this case mental-health, supported by online rants on social media) about the persona of a shooter as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the case of Fort Lauderdale is no different, as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.All too often we ve seen the  stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence reaches a court room.For the average person, it s hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event, causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The whole episode seemed akin to the WTC 1993 bombing case, which involved yet another informant working alongside officials.The Gun Control & Security AgendaAs pointed out in 21WIRE during 2015 s Oregon campus shooting, the primary focus for mass media concerning the Fort Lauderdale incident, will now be all of the hot button socio-political issues including  gun control-reform  and those concerned over  mental illness  background checks, along with those who constitutionally oppose such restrictive legislation.It should be obvious by now that events like Fort Lauderdale, along with other  mass-shootings , have become a sharp catalyst to usher in calls for endless new  mass shooting  protocols, inter-agency  fusion ,  first-responder  emergency medical protocols, and also for injecting more and more military terminology into civilian life   with the media playing a critical role in steering the public away from questioning any of the dubious elements surrounding any shooting event.In a sense, the media is helping to nudge these shooting events out of the forensic sphere and into the political arena as quickly as possible, effectively closing the feedback loop of concerned citizens and those who may have been affected by an event.The Fort Lauderdale shooting has prompted the mainstream media to feed into concerns over airport security, gun ownership and a persons mental health background. All of media s fear-inducing drama regarding the Fort Lauderdale shooting boils down to a contentious battle over gun reform and mental health as the Obama administration comes to a close. No doubt this latest shooting will give cause to new security measures in airports across America.Here s another look at outgoing President Obama discussing his frustration on gun control in a  legacy  interview with the BBC from 2015   amazingly, only a few hours before a mass shooting in Lafayette *UPDATE*  Broward Sheriff Scott Israel stated that deputies arrived on the scene between  60 to 70 seconds  after the Fort Lauderdale shooting took place   quite an incredible response time by most law enforcement standards.TMZ acquired footage of the Fort Lauderdale shooter in action   the video appears to display elements of staging   decide for yourself According to reports,  Airport officials, along with federal and local authorities, are investigating who had access to the footage and who allowed it to be taped without authorization, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief told the Sun Sentinel. *UPDATE* Just one week prior to the Fort Lauderdale shooting,  Florida lawmakers began rallying support for SB 140, a state bill that would repeal laws which, among other things, ban guns in airport terminals like the one where the shooting occurred.

" Pope Francis Slams The United States For Its “Brazen” Gun Obsession Pope Francis, while appearing at the United Nation s World Food summit, slammed the United States (and the rest of the world) over its obsession with guns after the terrorist attack in Orlando left 50 people dead and another 53 wounded. Calling the obsession brazen,  the Pope chided world leaders for their  strange paradox  over the politics of food and international aid, but not guns:It makes no difference where arms come from   they circulate with brazen and virtually absolute freedom in many parts of the world.The Pope also chastised the world for numbing itself to people s pain, saying  We are bombarded by so many images that we see pain, but do not touch it; we hear weeping, but do not comfort it; we see thirst but do not satisfy it. Hours after the brutal attack, the Holy See released a strongly worded condemnation of the attacks, calling his  homicidal folly  and denouncing those responsible:The terrible massacre that has taken place in Orlando, with its dreadfully high number of innocent victims, has caused in Pope Francis, and in all of us, the deepest feelings of horror and condemnation, of pain and turmoil before this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred   We all hope that ways may be found, as soon as possible, to effectively identify and contrast the causes of such terrible and absurd violence which so deeply upsets the desire for peace of the American people and of the whole of humanity.The condemnation is exactly what the United States deserves, especially when some right wing politicians (the same one who do nothing about gun violence) proclaim that we are a Christian nation. But how can we claim to be when we allow ourselves to become so numb to the epidemic that is gun violence?Perhaps the faux-Christians should listen to the Pope (yet again) and lead by example.Featured image via Flickr",0
" President Obama Furiously Blasts Trump And GOP For Blaming All Muslims For Terrorism President Obama is pissed off and he took Republicans and their nominee to the woodshed on Tuesday for inciting hate against all Muslims and insisting that describing terrorists using certain words will make the threat disappear.Ever since the mass shooting in Orlando, Republicans and Donald Trump have suggested that President Obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t said the words,  radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit, President Obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the Treasury Department. What exactly would using this language accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,  Obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military. The men and women who put their lives at risk and the Special Forces I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria   they know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots. And protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet, and appear on cable news shows. They know what the nature of the enemy is. So there s no magic to the phrase  radical Islam.  It s a political talking point. Clearly, Obama was taking aim squarely at Donald Trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet. But President Obama had more strong words to say to Republicans and Trump on the subject of discriminating against all Muslim for the actions of one in Orlando. We are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be,  Obama said in reference to Trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.  We re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting, where this can lead us. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals. It will make us less safe. Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has rarely displayed flashes of impatience or anger in response to the Republican Party, but after Trump and the GOP have started to suggest that Obama is helping the terrorists, it appears President Obama is done taking shit from them at a time when he is busy trying to take out ISIS leaders even as Republicans continue to refuse to do their part by declaring war.Indeed, if Republicans believe terrorism is such a big threat, one would think they would take the step of declaring war so that President Obama can use all the tools at his disposal to destroy the terrorists and present a united White House and Congress to the American people on this serious issue.But Trump and Republicans would rather play partisan games instead of doing their jobs to protect the American people.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
"BREAKING: SECRET RECORDINGS About Clinton Foundation Caused Hostility, In-Fighting Between FBI Agents Wow Peter Schweizer, author of  the chilling  Clinton Cash  book better make sure he has bodyguards wherever he goes, because his book could be the reason for the  collapse of the Clinton Crime family s house of cards .Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called  Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,  these people said.The account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment.The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn t think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn t let them pursue, they said.These details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey s disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email arrangement while she was secretary of state.On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey s disclosure of the emails.Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.WSJ   The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said.Much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the Clinton charity. The author of that book, Peter Schweizer a former speechwriting consultant for President George W. Bush was interviewed multiple times by FBI agents, people familiar with the matter said.The Clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.Mr. Schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe  patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions Hillary Clinton was making as secretary of state. As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department s criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York Mr. Capers  office didn t attend, these people said.The public-integrity prosecutors weren t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said.  The message was,  We re done here,    a person familiar with the matter said.Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to  stand down,  a person familiar with the matter said.The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.For entire story: WSJ ",1
"FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Comey’s Big Lie Exposed After Recent Discovery of Clinton/Lynch Tarmac Meeting Documents Comey lied and has been caught in his lie What next? FOIA request him again. He said there were no tarmac documents but now it turns out there were. Hundreds of documents were just recently turned over Oops! It s also absurd that there were never, as James Comey said, any documents. He signed a letter saying under penalty of perjury there are no documents relating to the tarmac meeting. Now we know that there are hundreds of them. So there are three possibilities here. Either Comey lied or he didn t understand the request  Either they ve lost the documents and they ve suddenly been found or they lied when they said there were no documents. Or they didn t understand the request but the request by the way is standard boiler plate that every lawyer is familiar with.    Fox Legal Analyst Greg Jarrett",1
"Georgia Judge Suspended for Comparing Attack on US Monuments to ISIS Actions 21st Century Wire says In the wake of the Charlottesville m l e, reactionary  social justice  flash mobs and assorted vigilantes have begun a campaign of attacking and destroying statues and monuments all over the country. The irrational rationale of these activists is that these historic monuments represent oppression and slavery, and therefore they must marked for ceremonial destruction. Watch this scene in Durham, North Carolina this week where, bizarrely, the hysterical mob of  liberal progressive  protesters lines up to take turns kicking the inanimate bronze statue on the ground, after it was pulled down in an impromptu ceremony. This is an emotive crowd, clearly carried away by the political hysteria: Question: Should a small violent, reactionary mob be allowed bypass any sensible public discussion or forum   thereby litigating and dictating history for the rest of the community and country?So this is really happening.

That s what his so-called  Thank-You  tour was all about. However, it seems that this one is a little different. White House press who ve spoken to Spicer about it are saying the following:Spicer says Trump rally in FL Saturday is a  campaign  event. So the 2020 campaign has begun.

He filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission saying he meets the candidacy threshold for 2020 on the day he was inaugurated, and now he s holding campaign events. And Spicer is saying the campaign will pay for them. The campaign will pay for use of Air Force One and lodging for the Secret Service and all his aides? Sure.But more than that, this is another way for him to avoid real work, and possibly to distract from the scandals mounting in the White House. He hates the business of being the president because he can t do what he wants, when he wants and how he wants. He can t be a dictator, and he can t tolerate people actually telling him he s wrong. But he can hold these rallies full of cheering people who admire him and hold him up as a god who s right about everything.This isn t normal. This is terrifying.Featured image by Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images",1
" The Tweet Trump Sent THE DAY His Son Had Russian Collusion Meeting Is Disturbing As Hell It s kind of poetic: Russian help and Trump s tweets are largely what propelled him to the White House, and those two things may also bring about his downfall.On news that Trump s son, Donald Jr., scheduled a meeting during the campaign with a Russian lawyer promising  dirt  on Hillary Clinton, the microscope on Trump s shady campaign only intensified. He s tried everything to get it to stop, including firing the FBI director investigating him, but it s all starting to come out.Making matters worse for the White House, Donald Jr. keeps digging himself a deeper hole. First, he tried to cover up the meeting. Then when he got caught, he lied about the contents of the meeting. Then when he got caught again, he admitted, with no apparent awareness, that, yes, he had tried to collude with the Russians, but since he failed it wasn t wrong. (Note: hiring a hitman to kill your wife is a crime whether the hitman goes through with it or not.)On Monday, following a weekend of collusion evidence against him, Donald Jr. again brought out his gold-plated shovel and started digging.Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent  went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017For what it s worth, staffers from other campaigns, both Republican and Democratic, have gone on record to say that there is a flat policy in election teams of handing over any information about an opponent seemingly obtained illegally or from a foreign adversary to law enforcement.

" Donald Trump Is An Illegitimate President-Elect Because Russia Helped Him Steal Election Russian interference in our election should immediately disqualify Donald Trump from the presidency.On Friday, a CIA assessment found that the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies and officials is that Russia hacked our election system to not only hurt American confidence in our democratic institutions but to help Trump win against Hillary Clinton.According to the Washington Post,The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances.This, of course, is a huge blow to Trump s legitimacy because he and his transition team have been strenuously insisting that Trump won by historic margins and that the country needs to unite behind him and kiss his ass. Now we know why.In response to the CIA report, Trump s team issued what amounts to a  nothing to see here, move along  statement, all while throwing intelligence officials under the bus. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It s now time to move on and  Make America Great Again. In fact, most intelligence officials and agencies warned President Bush that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So Trump just pushed a Bush Administration lie in order to hurt the credibility of our intelligence agencies.Also, Trump s  victory  is hardly one of the biggest in history. This is merely Trump trying to convince everyone that he s legitimate by exaggerating his election performance. The only problem is that we have the records from past elections. All of them. In just the last century alone, 18 other presidential election victories are bigger than Donald Trump s. That includes President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012.Furthermore, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which Trump is desperately trying to undermine by claiming that 3 million people voted illegally.Evidence of Russian hacking is what originally caused activists to call for recounts late last month in three battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. A recount in underway in Wisconsin while courts are preventing them in the other two as Green Party candidate Jill Stein continues to fight for election integrity.Now that our intelligence services have concluded that Russia DID hack our election in an effort to help Trump steal the election, it is more important than ever to make sure these recounts happen. In fact, they should happen in every state. Until then, Donald Trump should be considered an illegitimate president-elect.The fact that Trump and his team have been desperately trying to kill these recount effort is even more suspicious and gives the appearance that they are trying to hide something or prevent something from being discovered.Let s also not forget that Donald Trump himself encouraged Russia to continue hacking American institutions for his benefit. And they obeyed his request.This is a serious moment for our democracy. Allowing Trump to take office while ignoring the evidence that he cheated to win will only irrevocably damage American confidence in the integrity of our elections it will set a dangerous precedent. If Trump is allowed to get away with being aided by foreign agents, nothing stops Republicans or even Democrats from employing the same strategy in future elections. This needs to be stopped now before it it too late and the only way to do that is to stop Donald Trump from taking office and declaring Hillary Clinton the true victor.Impossible, you say? Not so fast. As it turns out, there is precedent for installing a defeated candidate when evidence of fraud is found. Huffington Post notes that a state Senate race in Pennsylvania was overturned and awarded to Republican Bruce Marks over Democrat William Stinson after real evidence of voter fraud was brought to light.Two of the elected officials who testified in the Pennsylvania case said under oath that they were aware of the fraud, had intentionally failed to enforce laws, and hurried to certify Stinson the winner in order to bury the story. The narrative recalls the Washington Post s revelation that Republican Mitch McConnell was aware of the CIA s conclusion that Russians had intervened and opted to do nothing.In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that Marks be sworn in to fill the Senate seat.So not only could the courts restore election integrity by ordering Trump to step aside, they can install Hillary Clinton as the true President of the United States by citing Russian interference in the election. The Electoral College could intervene as well by not voting for Donald Trump on December 19th. They should vote for Clinton instead.The bottom line is that Donald Trump had outside help, which means he owes Russian a huge favor should he be allowed to take office. Russia would own him and that puts our nation at serious risk. Russian interference makes Trump illegitimate and he should be disqualified from holding office. If we really care about our democracy, this is what needs to be done.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images",1
"Outrageous! Apparently $68 Billion Isn’t Enough For A Cali Train Project Does anyone else see the lunacy in this? You have a broke state that s trying to build a massive bullet train system and is over budget only in America s big government system where the  goofballs think money grows on trees Is anyone else 100% FED Up! with this bullish*t? I know I am! The monumental task of building California s bullet train will require punching 36 miles of tunnels through the geologically complex mountains north of Los Angeles.Crews will have to cross the tectonic boundary that separates the North American and Pacific plates, boring through a jumble of fractured rock formations and a maze of earthquake faults, some of which are not mapped.It will be the most ambitious tunneling project in the nation s history.State officials say the tunnels will be finished by 2022   along with 300 miles of track, dozens of bridges or viaducts, high-voltage electrical systems, a maintenance plant and as many as six stations. Doing so will meet a commitment to begin carrying passengers between Burbank and Merced in the first phase of the $68-billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco.However, a Times analysis of project documents, as well as interviews with scientists, engineers and construction experts, indicates that the deadline and budget targets will almost certainly be missed   and that the state has underestimated the challenges ahead, particularly completing the tunneling on time. It doesn t strike me as realistic,  said James Monsees, one of the world s top tunneling experts and an author of the federal manual on highway tunneling.  Faults are notorious for causing trouble.  The California High-Speed Rail Authority hasn t yet chosen an exact route through the mountains. It also is behind schedule on land acquisition, financing and permit approvals, among other crucial tasks, and is facing multiple lawsuits. The first construction began in Fresno in July, 21/2 years behind the target the rail authority had set in early 2012.A confidential 2013 report by the state s main project management contractor, New York-based Parsons Brinckerhoff, estimated that the cost of building the first phase from Burbank to Merced had risen 31% to $40 billion. And it projected that the cost of the entire project would rise at least 5%.Parsons Brinckerhoff briefed state officials on the estimate in October 2013, according to the document obtained by The Times. But the state used a lower cost estimate when it issued its 2014 business plan four months later.Jeff Morales, the rail authority chief executive, said he was not aware of the Parsons Brinckerhoff projection. A spokeswoman for the authority declined to discuss the differences in the estimates.Public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that support for the project has ebbed as costs have risen   and at $68 billion, the budget is already more than double the $33-billion estimate made by the rail authority before California voters approved bonds for the project seven years ago.Via: LA Times",0
" This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it. Period.Featured image via KIRO7",0

" President Obama Furiously Blasts Trump And GOP For Blaming All Muslims For Terrorism President Obama is pissed off and he took Republicans and their nominee to the woodshed on Tuesday for inciting hate against all Muslims and insisting that describing terrorists using certain words will make the threat disappear.Ever since the mass shooting in Orlando, Republicans and Donald Trump have suggested that President Obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t said the words,  radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit, President Obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the Treasury Department. What exactly would using this language accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,  Obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military. The men and women who put their lives at risk and the Special Forces I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria   they know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots. And protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet, and appear on cable news shows. They know what the nature of the enemy is. So there s no magic to the phrase  radical Islam.  It s a political talking point. Clearly, Obama was taking aim squarely at Donald Trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet. But President Obama had more strong words to say to Republicans and Trump on the subject of discriminating against all Muslim for the actions of one in Orlando. We are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be,  Obama said in reference to Trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.  We re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting, where this can lead us. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals. It will make us less safe. Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has rarely displayed flashes of impatience or anger in response to the Republican Party, but after Trump and the GOP have started to suggest that Obama is helping the terrorists, it appears President Obama is done taking shit from them at a time when he is busy trying to take out ISIS leaders even as Republicans continue to refuse to do their part by declaring war.Indeed, if Republicans believe terrorism is such a big threat, one would think they would take the step of declaring war so that President Obama can use all the tools at his disposal to destroy the terrorists and present a united White House and Congress to the American people on this serious issue.But Trump and Republicans would rather play partisan games instead of doing their jobs to protect the American people.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
"TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER and Dartmouth Grad Says He’d Be “OK if #BetsyDeVos was sexually assaulted” After DeVos Announced Law Would Be Restored In College Sex Assault Cases Texas Civil Rights lawyer Rob Ranco is a partner at The Carlson Law Firm at the Round Rock, TX location. He is the supervising attorney for the firm s three Austin offices.When Rob isn t busy chasing ambulances or using a bullying incident his daughter allegedly faced at school to gain celebrity, he s publicly telling the world he d be okay if Betsy DeVos, a mother, grandmother and US Secretary of Education was sexually assaulted. It looks the real bully has been exposed Here s Rob Ranco s vile tweet, that he quickly deleted after it started to get traction on Twitter:This is what Rob s Twitter account looks like now:Here is a link to the archived tweet and to the responses Ranco got to his disgusting comment: https://archive.fo/xNdigRob Ranco, a partner in the Texas Carlson Law Firm was apparently referring to a decision made by Betsy DeVos, that she announced earlier in the week regarding changes that would be made to  Title IX as it relates to the unfair and unlawful way sexual assault cases are currently being tried on college campuses.Betsy DeVos spoke on Thursday, September 7, at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen. Rob offered to give up his salary before the case was even settled in an effort to get the Austin Police Department to admit guilt before the settlement. The Youtube videos showing him asking for an apology for his client have all been mysteriously scrubbed, but we have managed to locate the grandstanding video and can be seen below:Rob mentions his wife Tonia, who has her own website and Youtube channel that caters to women in his profile on Twitter.Tonia has also shut down her Twitter account, as her husband s disgusting remarks are sure to harm her business whose primary market appears to be women.Leave it to a liberal to be so filled with hate for anyone who doesn t agree with him, that he s willing to destroy his own career, and in the process, destroy his wife s career as well.Here s a video of Rob promoting himself and his excellent skills as a lawyer: ",0

"Outrageous! Apparently $68 Billion Isn’t Enough For A Cali Train Project Does anyone else see the lunacy in this? You have a broke state that s trying to build a massive bullet train system and is over budget only in America s big government system where the  goofballs think money grows on trees Is anyone else 100% FED Up! with this bullish*t? I know I am! The monumental task of building California s bullet train will require punching 36 miles of tunnels through the geologically complex mountains north of Los Angeles.Crews will have to cross the tectonic boundary that separates the North American and Pacific plates, boring through a jumble of fractured rock formations and a maze of earthquake faults, some of which are not mapped.It will be the most ambitious tunneling project in the nation s history.State officials say the tunnels will be finished by 2022   along with 300 miles of track, dozens of bridges or viaducts, high-voltage electrical systems, a maintenance plant and as many as six stations. Doing so will meet a commitment to begin carrying passengers between Burbank and Merced in the first phase of the $68-billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco.However, a Times analysis of project documents, as well as interviews with scientists, engineers and construction experts, indicates that the deadline and budget targets will almost certainly be missed   and that the state has underestimated the challenges ahead, particularly completing the tunneling on time. It doesn t strike me as realistic,  said James Monsees, one of the world s top tunneling experts and an author of the federal manual on highway tunneling.  Faults are notorious for causing trouble.  The California High-Speed Rail Authority hasn t yet chosen an exact route through the mountains. It also is behind schedule on land acquisition, financing and permit approvals, among other crucial tasks, and is facing multiple lawsuits. The first construction began in Fresno in July, 21/2 years behind the target the rail authority had set in early 2012.A confidential 2013 report by the state s main project management contractor, New York-based Parsons Brinckerhoff, estimated that the cost of building the first phase from Burbank to Merced had risen 31% to $40 billion. And it projected that the cost of the entire project would rise at least 5%.Parsons Brinckerhoff briefed state officials on the estimate in October 2013, according to the document obtained by The Times. But the state used a lower cost estimate when it issued its 2014 business plan four months later.Jeff Morales, the rail authority chief executive, said he was not aware of the Parsons Brinckerhoff projection. A spokeswoman for the authority declined to discuss the differences in the estimates.Public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that support for the project has ebbed as costs have risen   and at $68 billion, the budget is already more than double the $33-billion estimate made by the rail authority before California voters approved bonds for the project seven years ago.Via: LA Times",1
"MOM AND 3 YOUNG DAUGHTERS Wearing Shorts, T-Shirts STABBED In French Resort Town By Moroccan Man For Being “Scantily Dressed”…”The religious motive of the attack is in no doubt” Remember when the French used to mock conservatives for being so closed-minded and unaccepting of their liberal values?  Remember when it was cool for Europeans to welcome anyone who wanted to cross their borders into their countries with open arms? A woman and her three daughters have been stabbed in a French resort for being  scantily dressed .An eight-year-old girl was left fighting for her life after the attack in the Garde-Colombe in the Hautes-Alpes region of Southern France.The man is believed to have attacked the three girls outside the family s apartment before entering the building and attacking the mother.Jean-Marc Duprat, a deputy mayor for the town of Laragne-Monteglin in the Hautes-Alpes region said the suspect, who is not related to them, was upset they were wearing shorts and T-shirts.The girls are believed to be aged eight, 12 and 14 while their mother is 46. The knifeman is alleged to have fled the scene by car before being arrested.Amaury Navarranne from the regional council said:  The religious motive of the attack is in no doubt. Via: Metro ",1
" Trump Finally Delivers On Promised Phone Call To Soldier’s Wife, Says The Most Disgusting Thing EVER After two days of controversy over Donald Trump s lack of response, attention, or even seeming to notice the four soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger nearly two weeks ago, he finally called the pregnant widow of one of the fallen soldiers, Sergeant LaDavid Johnson. At Miami International Airport, where she awaited the remains of her 25-year-old husband, Myeshia Johnson took the president s 5-minute call.On hand with Myeshia Johnson was Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, the US Representative from Johnson s district. Wilson has been critical of Trump s response   or lack of one   for longer than this has even been in the national spotlight. Sgt. Johnson s body was left behind after the ambush, and not recovered by the military for two days after the operation. Many questions remain about the ambush, the operation, and the planning that went into the entire effort. Some consider Trump s bluster on calling military families and his attack on President Barack Obama to be a distraction from those questions that have arisen.According to Rep Wilson, the phone call was  insensitive and insane,  and if accurate, what she conveyed from Sgt. Johnson s widow is possibly the worst thing anyone has ever said to the widow of a soldier, let alone the worst thing a president has said. Trump told Mrs. Johnson, He knew what he signed up for But when it happens it hurts anyway. Those are the words of a man who has either never suffered a loss or has never cared about one.The call was first reported by Ross Palombo, the Washington Bureau Chief for an ABC affiliate in Miami. After Palombo tweeted about the Congresswoman s account of the call, he was contacted by the White House, only for officials to chide him and tell him that the affair was none of his business:BREAKNG: Top White House official tells me about @realDonaldTrump comment to soldier s widow  The President s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.  @WPLGLocal10  Ross Palombo (@RossPalombo) October 18, 2017This kind of response is, unfortunately, just what America has come to expect from the disgusting Donald Trump and his cohorts in the White House.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1
"HILLARY CLINTON CRONYISM VIOLATES FEDERAL RULES: Chelsea’s “Best Friend” Given Millions In Contracts With The Feds…A New Low! Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to arrange Pentagon and State Department consulting contracts for her daughter s friend, prompting concerns of federal ethics rules violations.Clinton in 2009 arranged meetings between Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, a friend of Chelsea Clinton and head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group, with Pentagon officials that involved contracting discussions, according to emails from Clinton s private server made public recently by the State Department. Clinton also tried to help Deal win a contract for consulting work with the State Department s director of policy planning, according to the emails.Deal is a close friend of Chelsea Clinton, who is vice chair of the Clinton Foundation. Emails between the two were included among the thousands recovered from a private email server used by the secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Chelsea Clinton has described Deal as her best friend. Both Clintons attended Deal s 2011 wedding.Here s a little blurb from the fashion rag WWD on an event the two attended together: This story first appeared in the October 20, 2011 issue of WWD. Wearing a short-skirted black Chanel dress, Clinton began by crediting her longtime friend Jacqueline Newmyer.  Jackie invited me to see  Romeo and Juliet,  she said, remembering back to 1995.  The next time, I got my parents to come. And I have been coming here ever since.  That historic family night out occurred three years later. She and her parents arrived at the theater two days after Christmas 1998 and a week after the House of Representatives voted to impeach her father. The show they saw? None other than  Twelfth Night,  a tale of magical transformation. Talk about Freudian.Later, at the after party, Clinton elaborated on the nearly 20-year friendship with Newmyer, putting to lie the old Harry Truman quip  If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.   Jackie and I are still best friends,  said Clinton, who met Newmyer her first year in Washington at the Sidwell Friends School.  She was in my wedding, and I was in hers.  Clinton, 31, continues to work on snagging her Oxford Ph.D. while working at New York University and with the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Newmyer, 32, is the president of the Long Term Strategy Group, a military research firm in Cambridge, Mass.Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest.Specifically, the Code of Federal Ethics states that government employees  shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.  Pentagon ethics guidelines also call for avoiding actions that would create even the appearance of improper behavior or conflicts of interest.The Clinton email exchanges with Deal between 2009 and 2011 were among tens of thousands of private emails made public by the State Department under pressure from Congress and the public interest law firm Judicial Watch.Read more: WFB",0
" Longtime Republican Strategist Just Cast Her Vote For Hillary This is not something that happens every day, but it s exactly what Ana Navarro did on Monday.Navarro has been a Republican since Ronald Reagan was in office, but the rise of Donald Trump as the GOP nominee has disgusted her so much that she denounced the party said she would be writing in her mother s name on her ballot rather than give a vote to Trump.But Navarro changed her mind after thinking about the close election in Florida in 2000 in which George W. Bush won by a mere 537 votes. As a Florida resident, Navarro doesn t want a repeat that send Trump to the White House.So she cast her vote for Hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on CNN.I had hoped that a week before the election, Trump would be losing Florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter. But darn it, my home state is too close to call. Florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States. I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. I thought and I thought and I thought .Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against Donald Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country.Navarro, who is an immigrant, said she voted against Trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half. On the first day of his campaign, Trump called Mexicans  rapists  and as a Hispanic immigrant that infuriated Navarro. I voted against Donald Trump for every American who looks and sounds like me,  Navarro wrote.  Because we love this country. We are proud of this country. We stand as equals in the United States of America. Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, and as a woman herself, that disgusted Navarro to her core. I voted against Donald Trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent, bearing the embarrassment, even shame, for years,  she continued.And Trump has also insulted disabled Americans, which made this election gave Navarro a more personal reason to vote against Trump.I voted against Trump because of Daniel Navarro, my severely disabled brother. My entire life, I have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability. I had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person. Trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies. In front of millions of people watching on TV. Most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior.For Navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments. In the end, Navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future, bad character won t change.She slammed Trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing. And that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat Trump. Some tell me, in 2016 we should no longer expect the president of the United States to be a role model,  Navarro wrote.  I refuse to accept that. The president of the United States has to lift us all in moments of national grief. The president of the United States has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers. That person represents us all. That person is recognized as the face and the voice for America in front of the rest of the world, and more importantly, by our children. A person supported by the Klu Klux Klan and its former Grand Wizard David Duke can never represent me. He can never be a role model for me.We each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us, that we value most. My conscience compels me to do every little thing I can to make sure a bad person is not our next president. In America, we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections.One vote is our right. One vote is our weapon. I am exercising mine against Donald Trump.Donald Trump is so toxic that many Republicans like Navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for Hillary Clinton. So much so that some red states such as Texas, Arizona, and Georgia are in play for the Democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come. That s how bad Republicans screwed up by choosing Trump as their leader.Featured Image: Twitter",0
" Elizabeth Warren Announces That A Major For Profit School Is Banned From Accepting Students If there s one thing Elizabeth Warren hates, it s when ordinary citizens get the wool pulled over their eyes and are taken advantage of by greedy corporations.In an effort to make at least one company no longer have the ability to cheat students out of a proper education and tens of thousands of dollars, ITT Tech will no longer be allowed to accept students.Warren took to Facebook to make the announcement: ITT Tech   a massive, for-profit college   is currently under investigation by 20 state and federal agencies for cheating students. The SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey are all suing them for fraud. ITT Tech failed, again, to meet the scandalously low standards of its accrediting agency, but still sucked down a whopping $600 million in taxpayer dollars last year.Today, the Department of Education has finally declared that enough is enough, banning ITT Tech from enrolling any new students with federal student loan and grant dollars this fall. ITT s free ride is finally over, and the message couldn t be clearer: We will no longer stand by and allow these shady institutions to bilk taxpayers and cheat students. https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/636549976507499Warren also posts a link that explains what is happening and what current students can do or expect. Part of the article explains:As a current ITT student with federal loans, you have some options:You can continue your courses at ITT with your federal student aid. There s no immediate change to your program.You can transfer your credits to a new school (if that school accepts them) and complete your education.You can pause your education and wait to see how this matter resolves itself in the coming months. If ITT closes before you finish your program and you don t transfer your credits, you will likely be eligible to discharge your federal loans.This is huge news, and long overdue. All too often these for-profit schools continue to take money while providing subpar education, often not properly accredited. These schools spend more on advertising than education and take advantage of people who may not necessarily realize they are being robbed.It is wonderful to finally see some justice be made and watch at least another one of these scam schools be given what is long overdue.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
" Conservative Commentator Uses Nancy Reagan’s Death To Launch Racist Attack On Michelle Obama (TWEETS) When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation. But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.  AAmom (@AVD911) March 6, 2016And another @DebbieSchlussel you're actually racist scum  dmbrandon!! (@juiceDiem) March 6, 2016While this person made a rather helpful suggestion.@DebbieSchlussel let some light into your hateful heart   Chuck Daly (@ChuckDaly) March 6, 2016Former Will and Grace star Debra Messing drew attention to Schlussel s tweet, condemning it openly.Shame on you https://t.co/GPNI7EbqBs  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 6, 2016So Schlussel spent the rest of Sunday hate-tweeting Messing (getting no response) for the crime of speaking out against racism.

Many of our readers were in disbelief and demanded proof that StemExpress was an actual company that sold baby parts online. Here is the undercover video that exposed Planned Butcherhood: Here is your proof: StemExpress, the California-based company that serves as a middleman between Planned Parenthood and the organizations that seek body parts harvested from aborted babies, once advertised bulk discounts for baby organs and body parts. A screencap taken from a StemExpress page listing fetal liver products shows that the company openly boasted of bulk buying discounts available to new customers. Become a StemExpress customer today to receive 25% off your first order up to $1,000!  blasted an archived web page from 2012.The baby organ trade is a lucrative one for StemExpress. As recently as December 2014, packages of what StemExpress described as  fresh  fetal liver stem cells were listed at more than $24,000, according to an archived page listing its products and prices.Yesterday morning news broke that Planned Parenthood, the nation s largest and most profitable abortion provider, was in the business of trafficking organs taken from aborted unborn babies. Planned Parenthood s top medical director, Deborah Nucatola, was captured on tape trying to sell body parts from aborted babies and bragging about how she conducts abortions in order to maximize the number of organs and body parts that can be extracted from the children.StemExpress also advertised the financial rewards and benefits that can come from buying and selling baby body parts.Although Planned Parenthood vehemently attacked the Center for Medical Progress for releasing its damning video, the billion-dollar abortion provider did not deny charges that it was harvesting organs, tissue, and body parts from aborted babies.Via: The Federalist",1

" SICK: Colorado School Wants To Teach Little Girls To Be Christian, Submissive, And Pure For Future Husbands (VIDEO) A Colorado public school is facing the wrath of parents after they received an email urging them to bring their daughters to an event designed to turn them into pure Christian wives who submit to their husbands.Mesa Valley School District 51 sent an email to parents promoting an event called  Wake Up Sleeping Beauty: Worship At His Feet,  and includes a Bible verse from Luke 7:38 which seems to tell women and girls as young as 11-years-old to submit to their husbands. The event also aims to train girls to remain pure until they find a husband. In other words, indoctrinate them from a young age to hold strict religious views on sex, marriage, and gender roles. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. A video posted on Wake Up Sleeping Beauty Facebook page suggests that fathers keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they remain virgins until marriage, and features a creepy image of a father watching his daughter put on makeup.A girl then praises the event  Especially going through the time that I was, being cheated on. That was really hard for me but it also made me realize a lot that I needed to forgive him and he didn t have the qualities I was looking for in a husband. The image of a woman crying at a man s feet before wiping the tears dry with her hair was of particular concern to one parent. The idea of a woman or girl crying at a man s feet, then using her hair to wash his feet, then kissing his feet, seems pretty demeaning to me. Apparently the irony of this imagery used to promote an event which purports to strengthen or support girls/women is lost on all involved. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, it s also a violation of the Constitutional tenet of separation of church and state, because school officials used the district mailing system to promote a religious event.But District 51 Communications Specialist Jeannie Smith made a bullshit claim about the email not being religious at all. Having reviewed the flyer and KHB-R per your request, we do not find that the flyer promotes a religious organization or demeans a person or group on the basis of gender,  she wrote in an email to an angry parent.But the flyer did actually promote a religious event and a religious organization. The program is put on by Wake Up Ministries, which is a religious organization.So, Mesa Valley School District 51 flat out lied to parents.Schools are supposed to protect our kids from religious organizations, but Mesa Valley school officials allowed their own email system to be hijacked for religious purpose in an effort to indoctrinate young girls to their beliefs. It s outrageous and sickening. Someone needs to lose their job for this. At the very least, an independent investigation needs to be waged.Female students already have to put up with enough sexist bullshit from school officials as it is, particularly from unfair dress codes that blame teen girls for how boys act around them. The last thing they need is a school that shoves religion down their throats.Featured Image: Pixabay",1
" House Republicans Pave Way For Rampant Corruption Under Trump By Gutting Independent Ethics Panel House Republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during Donald Trump s reign in the White House.On Monday night, Republicans voted 119-74 to cripple the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of Congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked Capitol Hill. Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",1
" The Tweet Trump Sent THE DAY His Son Had Russian Collusion Meeting Is Disturbing As Hell It s kind of poetic: Russian help and Trump s tweets are largely what propelled him to the White House, and those two things may also bring about his downfall.On news that Trump s son, Donald Jr., scheduled a meeting during the campaign with a Russian lawyer promising  dirt  on Hillary Clinton, the microscope on Trump s shady campaign only intensified. He s tried everything to get it to stop, including firing the FBI director investigating him, but it s all starting to come out.Making matters worse for the White House, Donald Jr. keeps digging himself a deeper hole. First, he tried to cover up the meeting. Then when he got caught, he lied about the contents of the meeting. Then when he got caught again, he admitted, with no apparent awareness, that, yes, he had tried to collude with the Russians, but since he failed it wasn t wrong. (Note: hiring a hitman to kill your wife is a crime whether the hitman goes through with it or not.)On Monday, following a weekend of collusion evidence against him, Donald Jr. again brought out his gold-plated shovel and started digging.Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent  went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017For what it s worth, staffers from other campaigns, both Republican and Democratic, have gone on record to say that there is a flat policy in election teams of handing over any information about an opponent seemingly obtained illegally or from a foreign adversary to law enforcement. Famously, Al Gore immediately summoned authorities when a shady person obtained Bush s debate prep notes.When Gore campaign was sent Bush debate brief book, they called FBI.

"Shocking Report: Mind Blowing Cost of Illegals Is Highest Ever…Numbers Released Show Huge Burden To States [Video] EVERY American taxpayer should be outraged at the numbers in the report below. Open borders under 8 years of Obama is costing American taxpayers a tremendous amount more than ever before! Don t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR: Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE S THOMAS HOMAN S TESTIMONY FROM 2014: Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion. State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled  The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,  is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets. Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,  said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein.  President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,  said Stein.  Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,  he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don t come close to offsetting the costs. What s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table. The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,  said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",1
" SICK: Colorado School Wants To Teach Little Girls To Be Christian, Submissive, And Pure For Future Husbands (VIDEO) A Colorado public school is facing the wrath of parents after they received an email urging them to bring their daughters to an event designed to turn them into pure Christian wives who submit to their husbands.Mesa Valley School District 51 sent an email to parents promoting an event called  Wake Up Sleeping Beauty: Worship At His Feet,  and includes a Bible verse from Luke 7:38 which seems to tell women and girls as young as 11-years-old to submit to their husbands. The event also aims to train girls to remain pure until they find a husband. In other words, indoctrinate them from a young age to hold strict religious views on sex, marriage, and gender roles. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. A video posted on Wake Up Sleeping Beauty Facebook page suggests that fathers keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they remain virgins until marriage, and features a creepy image of a father watching his daughter put on makeup.A girl then praises the event  Especially going through the time that I was, being cheated on. That was really hard for me but it also made me realize a lot that I needed to forgive him and he didn t have the qualities I was looking for in a husband. The image of a woman crying at a man s feet before wiping the tears dry with her hair was of particular concern to one parent. The idea of a woman or girl crying at a man s feet, then using her hair to wash his feet, then kissing his feet, seems pretty demeaning to me. Apparently the irony of this imagery used to promote an event which purports to strengthen or support girls/women is lost on all involved. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, it s also a violation of the Constitutional tenet of separation of church and state, because school officials used the district mailing system to promote a religious event.But District 51 Communications Specialist Jeannie Smith made a bullshit claim about the email not being religious at all. Having reviewed the flyer and KHB-R per your request, we do not find that the flyer promotes a religious organization or demeans a person or group on the basis of gender,  she wrote in an email to an angry parent.But the flyer did actually promote a religious event and a religious organization. The program is put on by Wake Up Ministries, which is a religious organization.So, Mesa Valley School District 51 flat out lied to parents.Schools are supposed to protect our kids from religious organizations, but Mesa Valley school officials allowed their own email system to be hijacked for religious purpose in an effort to indoctrinate young girls to their beliefs. It s outrageous and sickening. Someone needs to lose their job for this. At the very least, an independent investigation needs to be waged.Female students already have to put up with enough sexist bullshit from school officials as it is, particularly from unfair dress codes that blame teen girls for how boys act around them. The last thing they need is a school that shoves religion down their throats.Featured Image: Pixabay",0
" ISIS Fighters Celebrate Trump’s Victory Because He Is The ‘Beginning’ Of America’s Destruction Donald Trump is the best player on the terrorist organization s team, and they couldn t be happier that he won the election.Tuesday s election results have not only emboldened racists to attack minorities across the country, it has emboldened ISIS.Trump s victory drew celebration from ISIS fighters on social media, and the comments should make Americans regret their decision to put such an inexperienced person in the White House. Rejoice, he will show America s ugly face,  said fighter wrote.And Trump has already done that by using the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is splitting the country along political and racial lines that will take years to heal. Trump can beg for unity all he wants, he squandered that opportunity from the very first day of his campaign. I am optimistic about Trump s victory because he is a stupid, arrogant, hubristic bull who is dumber than Bush,  another ISIS fighter said.And it s true. Donald Trump doesn t have a clue how to govern and he certainly doesn t know how to lead a military force. After all, he dodged the draft multiple times during Vietnam and ridiculously claimed that he  knows more about ISIS than the generals do,  all while expressing wonder at why the United States doesn t just use nuclear weapons to defeat enemies.Most of all, ISIS fighters are cheering Trump s victory because he is inspiring others to join them. Trump s vulgarity will embarrass (Arab) tyrants and enlarge the field of jihad,  one fighter wrote.  If Trump wins, it s in our favor,  another said.But they are only too happy to let Donald Trump rip the United States apart for them. Praise God, may He increase this,  one fighter said of the divisions and hate Trump has caused. If we can inflame the dissension and troubles in their countries maybe they ll withdraw,  wrote another, signaling that ISIS may try to stoke fear and violence among Americans.And they are hoping that Trump is the beginning of the end of the United States as a world power and beacon of democracy. Trump s rule may be the beginning of a split in the United States and the era of its disintegration, Considering Trump did significant damage to our democratic values and system, and the fact that Russia probably believes they have a puppet in the White House who will help them weaken NATO, it s pretty clear that Donald Trump is already harming this country domestically and around the world.America is a joke now because of Donald Trump s victory. He is a vengeful man who ignores facts and is easily provoked. ISIS wants nothing more than for the United States to sacrifice more blood and treasure in the Middle East and he may very well give them want they want because he wants to prove how tough he is. Our enemies sense weakness and they are moving to exploit that weakness for their own gain. Conservatives may think they found their champion, but our enemies know they found their fool.Featured Image: Brian Blanco/Getty Images",1

The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W.

They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats.

"Report: Facebook’s Zuckerberg Gave FBI’s Mueller Info for Russia Investigation The information below is almost like a satire piece from The Onion. It s so funny that anyone could claim that ads are believed to have swayed the election.How about the fact that Clinton was a horrible candidate? How about the fact that the American people are 100% FED Up! with phony career politicians. The  report  from Facebook was turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller. What a joke! THIS PROVES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!A WHOPPING $100,000 ON ADS:Facebook has turned over all information about ads  likely  purchased by Russian operatives to special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the social media giant had sent the former FBI director data including copies of the ads and the identity of the buyers. That report followed news that an internal Facebook investigation found it is agents of the Kremlin may have spent $100,000 on ads with  divisive messages  between June 2015 and May 2017.A Facebook blog post published on Wednesday said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages.PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CORRECT   IT S A  WITCH HUNT :Mueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The investigation has dogged and frustrated President Donald Trump, who has called it a  witch hunt  and a  hoax. According to Facebook, about $50,000 of the funds   about 2,200 ads   were potentially related to affecting U.S. politics. The majority of the ads did not reference the presidential election, voting or a specific candidate. However, the ads focused on  divisive social and political messages  about hot-button topics including LGBT rights, race, immigration and gun rights. Facebook has shared its findings with U.S. authorities.WHAAAAT?  EVIDENCE  OF WHAT EXACTLY?Facebook said in April that it found evidence some groups used its platform to sway the outcome of the election.It did not specify targets or who was behind the attack, but said its own findings did  not contradict  a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in January about Russian efforts to influence the election.Via: CNBC ",1
" Republican Panics On Live TV, Can’t Say Trump Is Capable Of Handling North Korea (VIDEO) Donald Trump s credibility and  power  has become such a joke that not even members of his own party have any faith in him to deal with the current issues that America is facing.On Sunday, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) unintentionally showed everyone just how little the GOP believes in Trump when he couldn t force himself to say that Trump could handle the current nuclear crisis the United States is facing with North Korea. In an interview with CNN s Dana Bash, Flake was put on the spot about how capable Trump is (and isn t). Bash asked Flake: Senator, there are a lot of people waking up this morning in this country very concerned about what they re hearing from North Korea. Do you share Clapper s concern, not just about North Korea, but with the president s ability to respond? Flake couldn t give a straight answer. He said: Well, I   I do have good confidence in our national security team and those who are advising the president. And the president does not have experience in this   in this kind of situation, but few presidents do when they come into office. And I m confident that the people around the president are giving him good advice, and I believe that he will follow it. I sure hope he does. Obviously, you like a leader that s measured and sober and consistent. Our allies want to hear that. I think our adversaries need to hear that. But we have got a good team around the president. Bash was quick to put Flake on the spot and point out that he hadn t actually said that Trump could handle this matter. Bash pressed,  Senator, you talked there about the president s team, but not about the president himself. Are you concerned about the president himself, as James Clapper is? Flake continued to stumble through this interview: Well, like I said, no president comes in prepared with regard to foreign policy experience. That s why you have a good team around them. I have had my concerns, I think everyone has, at some of the statements that have been made by the president with regard to NATO and other areas in foreign policy. Like I said, I think we   we want somebody who is   who is measured and sober and consistent and conservative in this regard. But he has a good team around him, and I have confidence in them. This is absolutely humiliating for Trump. Not only was his Defense Secretary, James Mattis, sent out earlier today to deliver a public statement on North Korea in his place, but now a member of his own party practically said Trump isn t capable of handling North Korea. Flake refused to support Trump and say he was a competent president, and instead opted to talk about the experts surrounding him.You can watch Flake humiliate Trump below:Featured image via screenshot",0

" White House Says It’s Releasing Hillary’s Private Concession Call To Trump In Bid To Humiliate Her Trump s emotionally unbalanced social media director and close friend Dan Scavino had what can only be described as a mental break and is now threatening to publish a video of the private concession call she placed to Trump (and appears to have been answered by Kellyanne Conway).To do so would be not only a major ethical violation but would break with the long-standing tradition of the winners showing an ounce of graciousness towards their opponents. Trump and his team apparently have no qualms with stooping this low. If there is a point of indignity even they will not cross, they have yet to reach it.Scavino has long relished in his role as Trump s nastiest bulldog. His position as White House social media director was handed to him, not due to experience or expertise but because he was Trump s golf caddie. In a White House bursting with nepotism and corruption, Scavino might be the least qualified person around   an impressive feat. He is also known for his viciousness and an unhinged streak of petty attacks on his or Trump s perceived enemies follows wherever he goes. Clinton, who won the popular vote by several million, still irritates Trump and therefore she is an enemy Scavino feels he needs to destroy.For his part, Scavino claims he is being trolled by Hillary supporters. A notable coward, he couldn t take the heat and began melting down on social media. (The irony of Trump s social media director being unable to handle being on social media should not be lost on anyone.)After posting this nonsensical  I m not mad, you re mad!  tweet, Scavino followed it up with the promise to release Hillary s concession phone call.Love @AlexBWall & team Clinton trolling me (b/c they have nothing else going on.) All experts & gurus over there  . that simply got owned! pic.twitter.com/R8so2rZCwN  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) May 9, 2017Screen shot via @KellyannePolls cell phone- of Huma's call at 2:30amE .6 months ago. I have on video & will share that in the near future. pic.twitter.com/Mzy2o8XXwQ  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) May 9, 2017It s hard to quantify the sheer level of petty vindictiveness going on in the White House. Trump s team of enablers and yes-men run from one squabble to the next. Very little time appears to be spent on actual governance, with a lot of their energy being consumed with in-fighting. Bannon is fighting with Jared Kushner. Kushner is fighting with Priebus. Kellyanne Conway is missing? McMasters is fighting with Bannon. Instead of leading by example, Trump is off golfing or wandering around aimlessly with a copy of the election map under his arm. Trump ran an experiment: What would happen if I filled the nation s highest office with the least reputable, most angry, insecure people in the country? The answer: This shitshow is exactly what happens.The only goal of Scavino releasing the private tape of Trump and Clinton s phone call is to personally humiliate Hillary Clinton. There is no political, social, or practical reason to do this. Even by the admittedly low standards of restraint and goodwill on display by Trump s White House, this is disgusting. Sadly, with Trump consumed by his efforts to smear Sally Yates, it appears unlikely that he will intervene and save his administration from yet another self-inflicted blow to their own dignity.I would say this is the foxes running the henhouse but it would be unfair to suggest foxes lack this amount of shame.Featured image via CNN",1

" Crowd Erupts In Boos When Military Mom Asks Pence About Trump’s Khan Statements A Mike Pence rally in Nevada turned ugly when a military mom asked the vice presidential candidate about Donald Trump s recent statements regarding Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala. Rally goers viciously booed her and demanded to know why she was even there in the first place.The woman, who was later identified as identified as Catherine Byrne. began by explaining that her son is serving in the Air Force. Of course, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. But when she continued, their mood quickly did an about face: Time and time again, [Donald] Trump has disrespected our nation s armed forces and veterans. And his disrespect for Mr. Khan  That was as far as she got before the crowd became vicious, booing her so fiercely that they drowned out her words. Why are you here?  one woman screamed angrily. But Byrne continued to speak You ve got a son in the military, how do you tolerate this disrespect? Pence finally stepped in after about 10 seconds and began to hush the crowd. That s OK,  he said. Pence then reiterated what he and said when he was confronted by protesters in Ohio last week: That s what freedom looks like, and that s what freedom sounds like. Pence then praised Capt. Humayun Khan and his family. Khan was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States military. His parents made headlines when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Republican nominee responded to Khizr Khan s criticism of his bigoted policies by attack them. Capt. Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family,  he said.  The story of Capt. Khan is an incredibly inspiring story. But in the next breath, Pence defended Trump. I have never been around someone more devoted to the armed forces of this country,  Pence said of Trump.  There is no one more devoted to the veterans in this country. One of the people booing Byrne was Denise Martinez. She said that she admired how Pence had dealt with the tense situation. I thought he handled it really, really well,  she said.  Looking back, I think I would ve taken the high road. He handled it the right way, the way I wish Trump would have,  she added.Barbara Weisenthal was another woman who was booing. In her opinion, Khizr Khan had no right  to speak about Trump the way he did at the DNC and his entire speech  was almost like slander. Weisenthal added that the rally was  probably not the best place  for Byrne to ask her question.Jack Christenson, who is a veteran himself, argued that even though Byrne had the right to speak out thanks to the Constitution, she didn t have the right  to violate everyone else s rights  by asking a question of a person running to be vice president.Roen Horn said Byrne was claiming that Trump was  somehow insulting the veterans,  which he said was  a bunch of crap. She was politicizing the veterans,  he said.  She had an agenda. Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images ",1

"THE LOST VIDEO: Watch MSNBC’S Mika Shamelessly Flirt With Donald Trump [VIDEO] With all the anger and nasty comments coming from Mika and Joe of MSNBC, the video below makes you wonder if the nasty Mika is just an act Ya think? These two media wh*res couldn t be happier that now they re in the spotlight.The change has been huge Mika has called President Trump every nasty thing in the book:Hour one of the MSNBC morning show began typically enough with Mika and Joe. The assembled gang could barely contain their glee at the prospect of damning testimony from James Comey. That all set the stage for a typical Mika Brzezinski tirade that was honestly one of the most disgusting assaults on President Trump yet. It s unhinged hate!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZoUCHs22Aw I think Trump is such a narcissist, it s possible he is mentally ill in a way and this is on the table, I said it months ago and now everyone is starting to say it like it s new, and it s ok to say. He s not well,  she said.  At the very least, he s not well. And he s so narcissistic he does not believe the rules apply to him, and that s where the ignorance label may apply because this is a man who says he can grab women anywhere because he s famous. Then something very curious happened.Scarborough looked off camera and can be heard saying,  What s that? Wow,  Then Willie Geist showed him something and the two started laughing. Then a clearly not listening Scarborough, banged the table. Stop right there,  he laughed  I need an eject button. He posted it?  Scarborough appeared to ask someone else?Brzezinski finally realized that nobody was listening to her and demanded an explanation. Nothing I have said is crazy,  she said. We ll talk about it in the break,  said Scarborough barely able to get it out through his own laugher.The show soon went to break. When it returned Scarborough joked about  keeping it in the guard rails. Brzezinski appeared to offer an explanation of her actions.  I am keeping it in the guard rails. Everything I ve said you all have thought and you know and you ve said in your own way. You re going to talk to me about a filter?  she snapped at Scarborough.",0

"WHOA! FEMINIST HACK LAWYER Gloria Allred REFUSES To Say If High School Yearbook Used As Evidence Against Roy Moore Is A Forgery This story just keeps unraveling Two days ago, conservative Thomas Wictor dropped a bombshell on Twitter, exposing what he suggested was a forged Roy Moore signature on the yearbook that allegedly belongs to Beverly Young Nelson, the most recent sexual misconduct accuser of GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore.CNN published a story about Roy Moore signing Nelson s yearbook. Thomas Wictor dissected the signature and the validity of her story on Twitter:Beverly Young Nelson said Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore wrote a message in her yearbook in December 1977 that said, ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'""She said he signed it, ""Roy Moore, D.A."" https://t.co/aluJzQsv15 pic.twitter.com/esjGd1ssd9  CNN (@CNN) November 13, 2017Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It's DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16, 2017(11) So, to recap:The signature is a forgery, and everything after the name ""Roy-Ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15, 2017Just like the ""TH"" doomed Dan Rather, ""DA"" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces. They copied his signature on Nelsons divorce order not realizing ""DA"" was his assistants initials, not his title. The sheer stupidity! pic.twitter.com/oWJ5fzM6fr  TruthHurts (@tru768) November 15, 2017Moore s attorney came out today with a statement regarding the signature in question in the high school yearbook. Here s what he had to say:Roy Moore's Attorney: ""[Nelson & Gloria Allred] said that Ms. Nelson after the allegations had never seen or had any contact with Judge Moore  In 1999, Ms. Nelson filed a divorce action  The judge assigned was Roy S. Moore."" pic.twitter.com/Bv5ZV0CMvc  Fox News (@FoxNews) November 15, 2017Meanwhile, the leftist, feminist lawyer, Gloria Allred, refused to deny that her client Beverly Nelson s  Roy Moore  signature in her high school yearbook is NOT a fabrication. CNN s Wolf Blitzer grilled Allred on the matter Wednesday.Big League Politics    Well, all I m saying is, we will permit an independent examiner of the writing We will allow all of this to be asked and answered at the hearing,  Allred said. But that s not a flat denial, Gloria,  Blitzer said. Well, all I m saying is, we re not denying, we re not admitting, we re not addressing,  Allred said.  We will not be distracted. Blitzer asked why Allred needed a Senate hearing and would not just permit an independent handwriting expert to take a look. Well, uh, all I can say is we want it done in a professional setting to the extent possible, that s the only setting in which people can testify under oath,  Allred said.Blitzer asked if Allred s client would take a lie-detector test, but she refused, pushing for a Senate hearing.Go to the 25:30 min. mark in the video:",0
"BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video] Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",1
"JPMORGAN CEO Blows Up at the DC Dysfunction: Tired of Listening to the ‘Stupid Sh*t’ [Video] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC",0
"BITTER RADICAL ERIC HOLDER Goes After ‘ORANGE MAN’ President Trump In Scorching Interview: ‘We want the America of Barack Obama’ The information below is disturbing and should be a wake up call for  Americans that the left isn t taking losing lying down. This is war A war for the heart of America!The quote below from Steve Bannon also goes for the left and the radical elitists like Holder He continuously mocks President Trump in the interview below by calling him  orange man . Holder is seething with contempt and hate. It s shameful behavior from a man who was once a very powerful member of a presidential administration in America. He exposes himself for the hateful racist we knew he was. This is scary and should be a big reminder that the war isn t over with these people. Keep up the fight!Bannon is 100% correct on this:Former Attorney General Eric Holder says he is glad to be unshackled from his old job because employment with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee lets him lash out at Republicans like  orange man  President Trump.Politico recently went on the road with the NDRC s chairman in Virginia for get-out-the-vote efforts on behalf of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor.An interview at Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church in Richmond covered everything from NDRC s efforts to raise over $30 million for gubernatorial races to Mr. Trump s alleged role in empowering  neo-Nazis and white nationalists. I probably would not have [attacked Republicans like] that while I was attorney general,  he continued.  I didn t have an orange man who I was serving under, but, I mean, I would not have said that about a former president, for instance, while I was attorney general. But now, I m just a citizen and I ve got the full range of my voice back.

"Active Shooter Drill Suddenly ‘Goes Live’ at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland SEE ALSO: 21WIRE calls out US media for hyping fake  Active Shooter  event at Andrews BaseDaily Shooter 21st Century WireWashington DC area was put on high alert today following reports of an  Active Shooter  a Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home of the president s Air Force One private jet.The base has been placed on lock-down and first responders are on-scene following a report of an active shooter at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located on Andrews.Authorities have instructed all personnel continue to  shelter in place. JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016There s only one problem with this story: we also learned that the base had planned a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am this morning, and as if by some amazing coincidence, during exercise, local first responders received emergency calls about a  real world  active shooter on the base. Still, this hasn t stopped flippant news anchors and  expert  analysts from US media outlets like CNN and FOX News from going into media-siege mode, and treating the event as if it were a real  active shooter  event   and injecting addition, unnecessary fear in the public discourse this morning.If one follows the inter-agency security protocols for a security exercise such as this, it would play out more or less exactly as it has today thus far, as evidenced by announcements by what other law enforcement and emergency services are saying.NBC News local affiliate adds here: Fort Belvoir in Virginia says it is increasing its  security posture  in response to the incident at Joint Base Andrews. It has advised its personnel to stay clear of Joint Base Andrews.  Last month Andrews had another  active  event, in what apparently turned-out to be a non-threat. Last month, Joint Base Andrews was placed on lockdown after a woman walked onto the base and claimed she had a bomb. An Explosive Ordinance Disposal team found the woman had no explosives, and she was apprehended.  The only question left now is: is this a real  active shooter  situation, or is this merely another example of a  drill gone live ?UPDATE 11:15AM ET: [Yes, we called it before authorities finally admitted  it was only drill ] JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md.  Andrews Air Force Base is  all clear  after a lock-down Thursday morning, amid confusion during an active shooter drill, according to a law enforcement official. According to a public information officer in the Washington office, the reason for this is because of the confusion over reports of a drill or an actual incident. The FBI field offices let security on Joint Base Andrews sort out the confusion.  (FOX6 NOW) Joint Base Andrews was locked down just after 9 a.m. after someone mistook an active shooter drill for the real thing, senior law enforcement officials told NBC News.

"TRUMP’S RIGHT AGAIN AND OBAMA’S WRONG! The US Is Currently Blocking Funds To Somalia!  Donald Trump has announced he would force Mexico to pay for a  wall at the border by threatening to cut off billions of dollars in remittances sent by immigrants living in the United States.A snarky Obama scolded Donald Trump on his plan: The implications in regards to ending remittances, many of which by the way are from legal immigrants, and are from individuals who are sending money back to their families, are enormous. First of all, they re impractical  The notion that we re going to track every Western Union bit of money that is being sent to Mexico, uh, good luck with that. Then we got the implications for the Mexican economy. Which in turn if it is collapsing sends more immigrants north because they can t find jobs back in Mexico. Of course, Barack Obama is wrong about this, too.The US already cuts off remittance payments to Somalia. US News reported:Following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Congress passed stricter money-laundering regulations, which caused several large U.S. banks to close the accounts of Somali money transfer operators out of fears that funds would end up in the hands of terrorist groups like al-Shabab. Regulation in the U.K. and Australia also made it difficult for Somali money transfer operators to work there.Since then, operators have scraped by through partnerships with small and medium-sized U.S. banks that still allow funds to be sent to Somalia. But Merchants Bank of California, responsible for transferring between 60 and 80 percent of the total remittances sent to Somalia from the U.S., announced it would shut down such accounts in early February, and reportedly is still implementing the policy.The Mexican central bank reported that money sent home by Mexicans overseas hit nearly $24.8 billion last year. It is the largest foreign source of income to Mexico. Trump s remittance plan ought to help fund the border wall in no time.Via: GP",1

" Paul Ryan Has A Request For Donald Trump, And Trump’s Campaign Won’t Like It AT ALL House Speaker Paul Ryan sold his soul the day he endorsed Donald Trump to be president of the United States. It was clear that he was just being a spineless, cowardly weasel when he did so, as he did it under cover of a big policy speech by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Ever since then, Ryan s relationship with Trump has been frosty at best, and they have never appeared on stage together.During a weekly press briefing, Ryan got the one question everyone has been asking: Why hasn t Donald Trump released his tax returns? This is especially pressing right now, as Newsweek just printed a damning story that shows that should Donald Trump become president, the Trump Organization s rather dubious web of international ties would endanger the national security of the United States of America. With that revelation, it is even more imperative than ever that the American electorate sees Trump s tax returns. Hell, even George W. Bush s ethics lawyer said that these ties are a, quote,  serious problem. Therefore, Ryan finally caved and said Trump s returns need to be made public. First, he referenced his own releasing of his taxes when he ran for Vice President: I did release my returns. I ll defer to Donald Trump as to when he thinks the appropriate time to release his returns. I know he is under audit, and he has an opinion on when to release those and I ll defer to him on that. He then hedged, though, because he is a coward who is afraid of upsetting Trump s supporters, and said: I released mine. I think he should release his. I ll leave it to him when to do it. No, Speaker Ryan, you need to get forceful with this. We need the returns NOW. With all of the shadiness surrounding Trump s business dealings and ties to nefarious characters around the world, this is vital information for the nation and world to know. Trump is trying to run the clock out on this one, to keep the voting public from knowing just what he gets up to. Do your job, and DEMAND Trump s tax returns.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",1

" Bernie Sanders Just Used Trump’s Own Tweets To Publicly Shame Him On The Senate Floor Donald Trump s tweets just became the club progressives like Bernie Sanders are going to use to hammer him with over the next four years.It s no secret that Trump is obsessed with spewing all kinds of bullshit on Twitter, but they are a liability that will make Republicans regret making Trump their leader.Because messages on Twitter can live forever. Even if Trump deletes them, there are likely always going to be copies that were captured via screenshot.But Bernie Sanders didn t need to worry about that because Trump rarely deletes his past tweets, which made things awkward for Trump and the Senate Republicans as Sanders took to the floor to passionately defend Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, all three of which Republicans want to gut after Trump takes office on January 20th.Throughout the primaries and the presidential campaign, Trump told his supporters that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Most prominently, he repeated that message on Twitter in May 2015 to claim that Mike Huckabee copied him by saying the same thing. I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,  Trump wrote.  Huckabee copied me. Well, during his time on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sanders used that very tweet against Trump, even going so far as to blow it up for all to see, to demonstrate that if Trump signs any legislation Republicans send him to target these sacred programs, he would be breaking a core promise to the people who voted for him.Sanders began by calling out Republicans for cruelly seeking to repeal Obamacare, which would leave millions of Americans without health insurance and increase the deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars.He then slammed Republicans for taking at a Medicare in their budget bill, a move that would eliminate Medicare as it currently exists, a government-run program that actually works to provide senior citizens the healthcare they need at a far lower cost than a private insurance plan would provide.Sanders also repeated a statement Trump made on April 8, 2015. Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security,  Trump said.  They want to do it on Medicare and they want to do it on Medicaid and we can t do it. It s not fair to the people who have been paying in for years. In March, Trump attacked Paul Ryan for planning to gut Medicare, but Trump made it clear that he doesn t support Ryan s plan because it will cost Republicans the election. Millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word,  Sanders declared.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is already backing away from his promises, which means his supporters were duped in the worst way. They were stabbed in the back and now have to face a future where Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and Obamacare do not exist. And they only have themselves to blame for believing Trump in the first place.Featured image via screenshot",1
" Elizabeth Warren HUMILIATES Ben Carson During HUD Hearing; Reveals His Intent To Line Trump’s Pockets (DETAILS) Donald Trump has nominated Ben Carson   an idiot in every area except that of brain surgery   to run the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Department. Carson has no experience in urban development, government, real estate, or anything else relating to the job he s trying to be confirmed to do, and therefore has no business being nominated for it. Therefore, his confirmation is   and should be!   especially difficult. Well, have no fear   Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren made sure of that.Senator Warren s first order of business was to make sure that Donald Trump, who is obviously a real estate tycoon, would not benefit from the activities of HUD under Ben Carson. Warren asked of Carson: Can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar you give out will financial benefit the president-elect or his family? Carson could not make that assurance directly, and said that he could only assure that would refuse to play favorites,  continuing: I can assure you that the things that I do are driven by a sense of morals and values. That wasn t good enough for Warren, though, and she pushed Carson further: It s not about your good faith. My concern is whether or not, among the billions of dollars you will be responsible for handing out in grants and loans, can you just assure us that not $1 will go to benefit either the president-elect or his family? Carson said of that question: It will not be my intention to do anything to benefit [Trump]. Since Carson refused to give any direct answers here, Warren drew her own conclusions saying: Do I take that to mean you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the president-elect? Carson insisted: You can take it to mean that I will manage things in a way that benefits the American people. Carson went on to say that he wouldn t directly promise that he wouldn t use Trump s family properties for HUD programs: If there happens to be an extraordinary program that s working for millions of people, and it turns out that someone that you re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say,  No, the rest of you Americans can t have it?  I think logic and common sense probably would be the best way. Warren concluded: The problem is that you can t assure us that HUD money   not of $10 varieties but of multimillion-dollar varieties   will not end up in the president-elect s pockets. And that s just the problem. Donald Trump is surrounding himself with sycophants like Ben Carson, who will use their positions of power to do anything Trump wants   including using federal dollars to line Trump s pockets. If and when this guy is confirmed, we ll literally be paying Donald Trump, via our tax dollars through Ben Carson s HUD Department, to house low-income families.This is shaping up to be the most corrupt administration in modern history.Watch the exchange below:.@SenWarren asks Dr. Ben Carson:  Can you just assure us that not one dollar will go to benefit either the President-elect or his family?  pic.twitter.com/lSyur2AYik  CSPAN (@cspan) January 12, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",1

" Americans BLAST Hypocrite Mitch McConnell For Whining About Democrat Plan To Block Trump’s SCOTUS Noms Karma is a bitch and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is learning that the hard way.For nearly a year, Republicans viciously blocked President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in a purely partisan refusal to do their jobs out of sheer hatred and contempt.Donald Trump is now set to take over the White House and now McConnell is whining because Democrats are about to demonstrate what  turnabout is fair play  means.Senator Chuck Schumer and his Democratic minority intend to block Trump s Supreme Court picks, indefinitely if need be to make sure Republicans do not get to fill the empty seat.So, McConnell complained by talking about the non-existent  Biden rule,  which Republican used to justify they re refusal to confirm Garland and then had the gall to claim that Americans won t tolerate the blocking of Trump s nominees. I noticed my counterpart Sen. Schumer announced yesterday that their goal was apparently to never fill the Supreme Court vacancy. That s kind of an expansion of Biden rule. You recall the Biden rule in 1992 was the Senate would not confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of a presidential election year, which was my view last year. Sen. Schumer said in the second Bush administration that they would not confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the last eighteen months of President Bush s forty-three s tenure. Apparently, there s yet a new standard now, which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that s something that the American people simply will not tolerate, and we ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it. Here s the video via Twitter.McConnell:  The American people simply will not tolerate  Democrats blocking Trump s SCOTUS nominee https://t.co/9b6sqFrQTM  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 4, 2017To the contrary, Americans, who voted against Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote (millions more if you count the other candidates on the ballot) very much disagree with McConnell and blasted his hypocrisy.@SenateMajLdr Fuck you and your hypocrisy  Jeremy M (@thismyshow) January 5, 2017@SenateMajLdr Mitch, prepare to meet karma.

As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies.

"BOOM! SMUG NEWSPAPER EDITORS Endorse Hillary…Phone Lines Blow Up With Subscription CANCELLATIONS Smug liberal newspapers and tv networks have paid a heavy price  for their criticism of Trump. Americans think of Trump as the underdog in this race and there s nothing worse than piling on the underdog. For these liberal hacks who have been writing their leftist opinions as opposed to real news for decades, they re about to find out what it means to be considered irrelevant by their former readers The subscription cancellations were coming every 10 minutes. Angry readers have been calling in droves. We re feeling the weight of our history,  Phil Boas, the editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Until it endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, the newspaper, founded in 1890, had never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president.In endorsing Mrs. Clinton, The Republic s editorial was, by any interpretation, scathing toward her opponent, Donald J. Trump.  Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads,  the editorial says at one point.  That s beneath our national dignity. The papers lay out different reasons for supporting Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump   his lack of political experience versus her established political career, his outbursts and insults versus her steadiness   and some are perhaps more repudiations of Mr. Trump than glowing endorsements of Mrs. Clinton, whose faults are also cited.For some readers, however, the endorsements proved a step too far.  Certainly, we ve paid a price for our presidential recommendation,  Mike Wilson, the editor of The Dallas Morning News, told Poynter this month.Mr. Boas of The Arizona Republic said he expected  a lot of cancellations,  pointing to cancellations at The Cincinnati Enquirer, which like The Republic, is owned by Gannett.But he said financial considerations were  never a factor  for the newspaper s nine-person editorial board.  It was more of a curiosity,  he said.  We know we re doing the right thing. We feel very good about this decision.

"THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: How Strong Arm Tactics By ANTI-CAPITALIST LEFT Could Destroy Millions Of American Jobs The fast food industry has been warning those demanding a $15/hr. wage that they could be easily replaced.In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton. It s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,  former McDonald s USA CEO Ed Rensi said in an interview on Tuesday on the Fox Business Network s  Mornings with Maria.   It s nonsense and it s very destructive and it s inflationary and it s going to cause a job loss across this country like you re not going to believe. According to Rensi, rising labor costs are forcing chains to cut entry-level jobs and replace workers with machines. Currently, Wendy s, McDonald s, and Panera are rolling out kiosks across the US, in part because of the rising cost of labor.  Business InsiderAccording to statista.com, in 2016, there were over 3.7 million people in the US who were employed in the fast food industry. When those jobs go away, where will these workers go for employment? Will they be forced to do the jobs that  only the illegal aliens will do? Wendy s just announced their plans to install self-ordering kiosks at about 1,000 locations by the end of the year.A typical location would have three kiosks, The Columbus Dispatch reported. Higher-volume restaurants will be given priority for the kiosks.Wendy s chief information officer, David Trimm, said the kiosks are intended to appeal to younger customers and reduce labor costs. Kiosks also allow customers of the fast food giant to circumvent long lines during peak dining hours while increasing kitchen production.Trim estimates the company will see a return on its investment in less than two years. They are looking to improve their automation and their labor costs, and this is a good way to do it,  said Darren Tristano, vice president with Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm.  They are also trying to enhance the customer experience. Younger customers prefer to use a kiosk. Customers will still be able to order at the counter for now, although Tristan predicts that mobile ordering and payment via smartphones will one day overtake self-ordering kiosks and cash registers.

" Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",0
" WATCH: Pelosi Knows The Russians Have Something HUGE on Trump and He’ll Do Anything To Keep It Quiet So many questions have come up in the wake of James Comey s Senate testimony. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is again asking the harsh but necessary question,  What do the Russians have on Donald Trump? Pretty much everyone is in agreement that Thursday s testimony by James Comey was totally devastating for Trump. Even Trump s buddies over at Fox News are admitting it was  very damaging for the president. By far the most incriminating statement made by Comey was that he couldn t  remember any conversations with the president about the Russia election. The fact the Russia attempted to control the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is indisputable at this point. What s curious is that Trump had no interest in the fact that our democracy was attacked and how we remain susceptible to attacks in the future.This total lack of concern for foreign election hijack prompted Pelsoi in a press conference on Friday to ask some critical questions. So again I ask the question, What do the Russians have on Donald Trump   politically, personally, or financially   that he just won t go to that place and instead enshrines them, sings and dances to their tune. And Republicans in Congress have been resistant to finding it   have resisted finding out the truth. So I think there are other remedies that we can exhaust. I respect the opinion of those who think he should come. But I think we   if the Republicans in Congress would be more, shall we say, open to facts and the truth, we can learn a lot without the president coming here. Comey warned us on Thursday,  They re coming after America.  Why does that not concern or pique any interest from the president?

"WATCH: CHEROKEE PEOPLE Express Disgust Over “Lying” Elizabeth Warren Faking “Native American Heritage” To Get Prestigious Law Professor Job Oh look Hillary s considering a lying, opportunist, Democrat politician with a vagina as her running mate. It all makes perfect sense if you consider that Hillary s thinking ahead, and that if anything happened to her she wants to make sure she has someone with the same morals and ethics to fill her corrupt shoes In Warren s book  A Fighting Chance,  Massachusetts Democratic senator and potential vice presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite history regarding the controversy surrounding her  Native American  ancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What s remarkable is that, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to get away with it. In fact, it s virtually ignored that to this day Warren still refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this controversy.To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her claims of Native American heritage, which is true. The larger and unaddressed issue, however, is whether or not Warren falsely claimed minority status in order to gain an unfair advantage in her academic career. This was a question that was unresolved at the end of the 2012 campaign and it remains unresolved with the publication of Warren s book.Watch Cherokee people from ND tell how they feel about Lying Elizabeth using phony  Native American  status to gain an advantage in obtaining a job:First, what s perhaps most notable about Warren s book is that she even includes a section called  Native American,  in which she reportedly writes,  Everyone on our mother s side   aunts, uncles, and grandparents   talked openly about their Native American ancestry. My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents  courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory. This is ironic because, until the Boston Herald first broke the news in April 2012 that Harvard Law School had repeatedly promoted Warren as a Native American faculty member, Warren never once mentioned these stories of her upbringing in a single press interview, speech, class lecture or testimony at any point, ever, in her decades-long career. What s more, Warren was not listed as a minority on her transcript from George Washington University where she began her undergraduate education, nor did she list herself as a minority when applying to Rutgers University Law School in 1973.In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage. It s important to note that entrance and advancement in the law school profession is governed by the Association of American Law Schools, which requires registrants interested in teaching at law schools to fill out a questionnaire detailing their education, experience, bar passage and, yes, ethnicity. This information is then disseminated to law schools around the country that, as Warren surely knew, are always on the lookout to add to the diversity of their faculty.A copy of Warren s questionnaire currently resides in the Association of American Law Schools archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, only Warren herself has the authority to release the complete copy of her questionnaire and to date, she has refused to do so.Watch Warren stonewalling the press over her phony  Native American  status and double down on her refusal to clear the record and release the copy of her questionnaire: Her opposition to such transparency can perhaps be understood in the documented fact that in the years thereafter, starting in 1986, Warren began self-reporting herself as a  minority professor  in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory that lists all law school professors around the country. As the former association chairman told the Boston Herald, the directory once served a tip sheet for law school administrators, in the pre-Internet days, who were looking to identify and recruit minority professors.Remarkably, Warren s explanation to the Boston Herald was that she listed herself as a minority in the hopes that she would be invited to a luncheon so she could meet  people who are like I am  and she stopped checking the box when that didn t happen. Perhaps it  didn t happen  because at no point, at any of the schools she attended or worked at, is there any evidence that Warren ever joined any Native American organizations on campus or in any way interacted with anyone in the Native American community.That did not however, stop Warren from continuing to self-report as a Native American minority. The New York Times reported in May 2012 that Warren was listed as a minority recipient of a teaching award years earlier at the University of Pennsylvania where she had advanced after teaching at several non-Ivy League law schools. Notably, Penn declined to explain to the Times why Warren was listed as a minority.From Penn, Warren moved on to Harvard Law School, where her Native American heritage was touted in multiple articles, including a Fordham Law Review piece that lauded her as Harvard Law s   first woman of color.  Even as recently as 2011, it appears Warren was listed as the lone Native American faculty member on the school s 2011  diversity report,  though like Penn, Harvard also refused to comment.Yet, when the Herald first broke the story in April 2012, Warren claimed she  had no idea  that Harvard had touted her Native American status and claimed she did not  recall  ever citing her Native American heritage when applying for a job. In the months afterward, Warren ducked, dodged and stonewalled subsequent questions, eventually wearing-out the press, and succeeded in winning an election without ever releasing any records that might substantiate those claims.Whether Warren falsely claimed to be a minority in order to game the system and advance her career is a question that goes to the heart of her honesty and integrity. It s also a question that will confront her if she ever seeks higher office. Via: US News",1
" ISIS Fighters Celebrate Trump’s Victory Because He Is The ‘Beginning’ Of America’s Destruction Donald Trump is the best player on the terrorist organization s team, and they couldn t be happier that he won the election.Tuesday s election results have not only emboldened racists to attack minorities across the country, it has emboldened ISIS.Trump s victory drew celebration from ISIS fighters on social media, and the comments should make Americans regret their decision to put such an inexperienced person in the White House. Rejoice, he will show America s ugly face,  said fighter wrote.And Trump has already done that by using the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is splitting the country along political and racial lines that will take years to heal. Trump can beg for unity all he wants, he squandered that opportunity from the very first day of his campaign. I am optimistic about Trump s victory because he is a stupid, arrogant, hubristic bull who is dumber than Bush,  another ISIS fighter said.And it s true. Donald Trump doesn t have a clue how to govern and he certainly doesn t know how to lead a military force. After all, he dodged the draft multiple times during Vietnam and ridiculously claimed that he  knows more about ISIS than the generals do,  all while expressing wonder at why the United States doesn t just use nuclear weapons to defeat enemies.Most of all, ISIS fighters are cheering Trump s victory because he is inspiring others to join them. Trump s vulgarity will embarrass (Arab) tyrants and enlarge the field of jihad,  one fighter wrote.  If Trump wins, it s in our favor,  another said.But they are only too happy to let Donald Trump rip the United States apart for them. Praise God, may He increase this,  one fighter said of the divisions and hate Trump has caused. If we can inflame the dissension and troubles in their countries maybe they ll withdraw,  wrote another, signaling that ISIS may try to stoke fear and violence among Americans.And they are hoping that Trump is the beginning of the end of the United States as a world power and beacon of democracy. Trump s rule may be the beginning of a split in the United States and the era of its disintegration, Considering Trump did significant damage to our democratic values and system, and the fact that Russia probably believes they have a puppet in the White House who will help them weaken NATO, it s pretty clear that Donald Trump is already harming this country domestically and around the world.America is a joke now because of Donald Trump s victory. He is a vengeful man who ignores facts and is easily provoked. ISIS wants nothing more than for the United States to sacrifice more blood and treasure in the Middle East and he may very well give them want they want because he wants to prove how tough he is. Our enemies sense weakness and they are moving to exploit that weakness for their own gain. Conservatives may think they found their champion, but our enemies know they found their fool.Featured Image: Brian Blanco/Getty Images",0
"BREAKING: Russia Backfires! Clinton Campaign and DNC Busted In Huge Discovery On Fake Salacious Trump Dossier Wow!

Russia collusion was with Dems in 2016 election. #MAGA #DTS pic.twitter.com/4OnuUx01lB  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 25, 2017The Washington Post just revealed:The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS s research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary. The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.Fusion GPS gave Steele s reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS s role.The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign s possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier.THANKS TO TRUMP S PRESSURE, THE TRUTH CAME OUT:Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should  immediately release who paid for it. Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. Spokesmen for the Clinton campaign and the DNC had no immediate comment.Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a  client-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS s bank records.People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost.Read more: WaPo",1

" Trump Just ADMITTED He Mindlessly Parrots Russian Propaganda And Twitter Kicked His Teeth In (TWEETS) Donald Trump once said that he loves  the poorly educated,  and he skips his intelligence briefings regularly, so it is reasonable to assume that he is not a fan of  intelligence  in any form. But on Thursday, the Donald took to Twitter to assure everyone that this isn t true   and to backtrack on his agreements with Julian Assange so fast that one is forced to wonder what information he learned about Russia s hack of the election in the past 24 hours.

Nevertheless, though he admits he doesn t look into who gives him information, Assange claims that he didn t receive the emails  from Russia.  On Wednesday, Trump mindlessly parroted the claim because it supports his nonsensical decision to spend every waking moment doing the Twitter equivalent of dropping to his knees in front of Putin and, well, you get the idea.In his nonsensical morning tweet, Wednesday Edition, Trump informed the world that his  intelligence  (yes, he put the word in quotes again) had been delayed by a few days and attacked  intelligence agencies  (he could have meant any of the more than a bakers  dozen who say that Russia absolutely hacked us, and Putin led the operation, but he seems to mean the CIA). This was a lie.He followed that up by spreading Assange s nonsensical claim that their friend Vladdy Poot didn t give him the information and by attacking the DNC for getting hacked.But even though The Donald regularly tweets out agreements with Assange   including the false claim that Russia had nothing to do with the hack (something he would know if he actually attended intelligence briefings)   he says his tweets should not be construed as agreement with the sexual predator behind the release of some of the hacked documents Russian hackers stole.

I don't think you know what you want to say. for the people  Billy Spillwater (@BillySpillwater) January 5, 2017Interestingly, in 2010, Trump didn t agree with Assange so much as he wanted to have him murdered. You see, before Russia and Wikileaks teamed up to hack and release information about his opponent in what the intelligence community agrees was an effort to install him in office, The Donald said that Assange is  disgraceful  and that  there should be like death penalty or something  for his new rapist friend.Putin, on the other hand, Trump has just always loved. A few years back, The Donald tweeted that he hopes the brutal Russian dictator becomes his  new best friend. It s nice that we re all friends now, and that Assange and Trump are bonding over the  dishonest press,  but if Trump is getting his  intelligence  from Russia and some rapist, it s time we talk about peacefully removing him from the White House and   what was that thing he wanted to do to his opponent, who had legitimately not committed a crime? Oh, yes,  locking him up. Featured image via Getty Images (Christopher Furlong)/screengrab",1

" Thanks To Trump The U.S. Economy Lost Jobs For The First Time In 7 Years After taking office, Donald Trump has repeatedly taken credit for President Obama s economy and regularly touts jobs numbers on his Twitter timeline. Now that Trump s economy is in effect, we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing 33,000 jobs last month.While some of this can be attributed to natural disasters, Trump has also failed to pass any major legislation.Job growth in August and July was revised down, to 38,000 less than previously reported. Economists expected 75,000 new jobs instead of a 33,000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172,000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91,000 average over the past three months, showing a trend which is not in Trump s favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number, because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth, suggested the slowdown is not all weather related.After Obama took office, he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars, but he did it. Obama s economy took an upward swing, even after natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the floods which ravaged Louisiana. Throughout his campaign, Trump called Obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents, that was far from the truth.Fact: Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. Obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed 75 consecutive months of growth.The unemployment rate, however, just fell to 4.2 percent, and we re sure Trump will bring that up. Let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward North Korea. Also, if Trump manages to get the GOP tax proposal in the works, we ll see more reports like this one.But for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything Obama has done, he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in 7 years.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images.

"THE NEW SWEDEN: Rapes, Riots, Severed Heads, Freeloading Foreigners And Shocking Acquittals The consequences of throwing out the welcome mat for people who have no intention of obeying your rules or living in a world with morals or values  Some 30 Muslim men thought that the woman was in violation of Islamic sharia law, by being in Sweden unaccompanied by a man. They thought that she should therefore be raped and her teenage son killed.  Two Swedish citizens were convicted by a Gothenburg Court of joining an Islamist terror group in Syria and murdering two captives. Video evidence showed one victim being beheaded.  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air.    Court Chairman Ralf G. Larsson.  Sometime during the night, the victim was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. At first, the woman did not want to call the police.  She felt sorry for him [the rapist]   and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. One week after Sweden raised its terror alert level to the highest ever, the police raised another alarm   saying their weapons are simply not good enough to prevent a potential terror attack.November 4: The Swedish Immigration Service sent out a press release, saying that it had hired close to a thousand additional employees since June. The Immigration Service now has over 7,000 employees, including hourly workers and consultants   double the 3,350 employees who worked there in 2012. Most of the new recruits work with the legal processing of asylum applications, but the units dealing with receiving migrants and filing their initial applications have also expanded considerably. As if the record influx of migrants this autumn were not crushing enough, the Immigration Service also had trouble retaining its staff. Employees complain about being badly treated: they are always expected to be on call, and possibly even work Christmas Eve.November 4: Bobel Barqasho, a 31-year-old Syrian, was sentenced by Sweden s Supreme Court to 14 years in prison. Before his case reached the Supreme Court, Barqasho had been sentenced by a lower court to 9 years in prison, then acquitted by the Court of Appeals. In February 2013, Barqasho threw his wife off a sixth-floor balcony. Against all odds, the woman survived the 13-meter (about 43 feet) fall, but was badly injured. When she woke up after five weeks in a coma, her head was held together by a helmet, her face felt loose, and her teeth were gone. In the Court of Appeals, the defense managed to plant reasonable doubt about the man s guilt by claiming the woman was depressed and had jumped of her own free will] so the Court of Appeals set him free. By the time the Supreme Court pronounced its sentence of 14 years, Barqasho had disappeared. He is now being sought by Interpol.November 6: The Gr nkulla School in Alvesta closed after reports of a rape at the facility spread on social media. A Somali boy had apparently been sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl for some time. On October 17, he allegedly took his attentions a step farther, pulled the girl behind a bush and raped her. The girl s father had been unsuccessful in trying to get the school to address the problem earlier, but even after the reported rape, the school s management did not act. The boy was allowed to continue going to the school   just on a schedule different from the girl s. Her distraught parents told the news website Fria Tider:  We are being spat on because we are Swedish.  In protest against the school s management, many parents, viewing the school as having sided with the perpetrator, moved their children to other schools.November 9: Social commentator and whistleblower Merit Wager revealed on her blog that administrators at the Immigration Service had all been ordered to  accept the claim that an applicant is a child, if he does not look as if he is over 40.  A staggering 32,180  unaccompanied refugee children  had arrived during 2015 by December 1   since then another 1,130 have come   and the government finally decided to take action.If its proposition is approved by Parliament, everyone who looks adult-aged will be forced to go through a medical age-determination procedure. One of the reasons Sweden stopped doing these in the first place, was that pediatricians refused to take part in them. They said the procedures were  unreliable. November 10: A 28-year-old Iraqi man was prosecuted for raping a woman on a night train between Finland and Sweden. The man had originally planned to seek asylum in Finland, but had found the living conditions there too harsh. He had therefore taken a train back to Sweden. In a couchette (sleeping car where men and women are together), the rapist and two other asylum seekers met one of the many Swedish women whose hearts go out to  new arrivals.  The woman bought sandwiches for the men; they drank vodka. When two of the men started groping the woman, she told them to stop, yet chose to lie down and go to sleep. Sometime during the night, she was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. To the attendant s surprise, the woman did not immediately want to press charges. The court documents state:  The train attendant asked if he should call the police. At first, the woman did not want him to do so, because she did not want to put N.N., an asylum seeker, in a tough spot. She felt sorry for him  and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. The man was given a sentence of one year in prison, payment of 85,000 kronor (about $10,000) in damages, and deportation   but will be allowed to come back to Sweden after five years.November 10: An Algerian and a Syrian asylum seeker were indicted for raping a Swedish woman in Str ngn s. The men, 39-year-old from Algeria and 31-year-old from Syria, met the woman in a bar one night in August. When the woman left, one of the men followed her, pulled her to the ground, and assaulted her. Afterwards, the woman kept walking, and ran into two other men   the Syrian and another unidentified man   and was raped again. The Syrian reportedly also spit her in face and said,  I m going to f k you, little Swedish girl.  The men, who lived at the same asylum house, denied knowing each other when questioned by the police.The verdict was announced on December 1. Rapist number one was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 117,000 kronor (about $14,000) in damages, and deportation to Algeria. Rapist number two was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to four years in prison. He cannot be deported, however, because  there are currently hindrances towards enforcing deportations to Syria.  He was also ordered to pay the woman 167,000 kronor (about $20,000) in damages.November 13: A trial began against eight Eritrean men, between the ages of 19 and 26, who according to the District Court,  crudely and ruthlessly  gang-raped a 45-year-old woman. She had been waiting in a stairwell for a friend when the men invited her into an apartment. Inside, she was thrown on the floor, held down, beaten and brutally raped. When questioned by the police, she said,  It felt as if there were hands and fingers everyplace. Fingers penetrated me, vaginally, anally. It hurt very much. I could feel the fingernails.  She said she could also hear the Eritreans laughing and speaking in their own language while they raped her.  They seemed to be enjoying themselves,  she said.When two of the men started fighting over who should rape her next, she tried to flee, but one of the men hit her over the head; she fell unconscious. After coming to, she escaped out a window and was able to reach a neighbor.The District Court of Falun established that several men had taken part in the attack, but the District Attorney was unable to prove who had done what. Therefore, only one man was convicted of aggravated rape, and sentenced to five years in prison. The others were sentenced to only 10 months in prison for helping to conceal a serious criminal offense. After serving their time, the men will be allowed to stay in Sweden.November 14: The Swedish Security Service, S po, warned again of Muslim terrorists hiding among migrants. The number of individuals listed as potential security threats has tripled this year, and includes several hundred who may be ready to carry out  Paris-style  attacks.As the Immigration Service has a huge backlog in trying to register all 150,000 asylum seekers who have come to Sweden so far in 2015, there are probably also many migrants that would be considered potential security threats.November 14: Sweden s Foreign Minister, Margot Wallstr m, made yet another strange statement with diplomatic consequences. The day after the Paris attacks, in an interview with Swedish Public Television, Wallstr m was asked,  How worried are you about the radicalization of young people in Sweden who choose to fight for ISIS?  Wallstr m replied: Yes, of course we have a reason to be worried not only here in Sweden but around the world, because there are so many who are being radicalized. Here again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East, where not least the Palestinians see that there isn t any future for us [the Palestinians], we either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence. Two days later, the Swedish ambassador to Israel, Carl Magnus Nesser, was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Its spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, later told Reuters,  The Swedish Foreign Minister s statements are appallingly impudent  [She] demonstrates genuine hostility when she points to a connection of any kind between the terror attacks in Paris and the complex situation between Israel and the Palestinians. In a formal statement, the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied that Margot Wallstr m s remark had connected the Paris attacks with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Swedish Conservative (Moderaterna) Member of Parliament, Hanif Bali, sarcastically tweeted that it seemed the Foreign Minister is suffering from an  obvious case of Israel-Tourette s. November 18: The Authority for Civil Protection and Contingency Planning (MSB) warned that the asylum situation was not only  very strained,  but that things keep getting worse   and that in some parts of Sweden, the authorities can only function until the end of December. Meanwhile, the Immigration Service calculated that another 13,000 beds are needed in so-called evacuation accommodations.  The problem cannot be fully solved even if the Armed Forces help provide more housing or if the MSB could arrange more tent accommodations,  the authority wrote.The massive influx of asylum seekers has also led to native Swedes  being crowded out of the health care and social services systems,  according to the MSB.  It [the MSB] is so busy handling unaccompanied children and asylum seekers, that there simply is not enough time to tend to the everyday functions, such as healthcare and social services,  said Alexandra Nordlander, Chief of Operative Analysis at the MSB, to the daily tabloid, Aftonbladet.November 19: A fire broke out at Lundsbrunn Spa, a few weeks after plans were announced to convert the historic building into the biggest asylum-seekers  home in Sweden. According to the police, the fire was not an arson, but started in a wood-pellet stove.Many hotels and spas have transforming themselves into asylum-seekers  housing, in order to profit from lucrative deals offered by the Immigration Service. Lundsbrunn Spa, near a mineral spring, dates back to 1890; in 1817, a hospital was established on the grounds. The nearby village is home to fewer than 1,000 people, so when Lundsbrunn Spa decided to accept an offer from the Immigration Service, the village faced a doubling of its population. The owners of Lundsbrunn wrote on the Spa s website that they see the transformation from spa to asylum-seekers  home as a temporary measure.November 20: Norwegian businessman Petter Stordalen, the billionaire owner of Nordic Choice Hotels, announced that the chain s many properties in Scandinavia and the Baltic states would no longer serve their guests sausage and bacon for breakfast. The breakfast buffet of the Nordic Choice s Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg was named earlier this year the best hotel breakfast in the world by the British newspaper, The Mirror. But apparently, this award did not matter.The cause for the hotel s decision was cited as  health reasons.  The internet, however, was soon abuzz with speculation that the real reason was adaptation to Islamic dietary laws (halal). One week later, Stordalen backtracked. The reaction from hotel guests had been too strong. Many people vented their anger over the withheld bacon on Stordalen s Facebook page. Stordalen commented:  The guests have spoken. Comfort Hotels are bringing back bacon. November 23: Hassan Mostafa Al-Mandlawi, 32, and Al Amin Sultan, 30, were indicted in the Gothenburg Municipal Court, suspected of having traveled to Syria in 2013 and murdering at least two people there. The charge was terrorist crimes, (alternatively crimes against international law) and murder. Chief Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstr m, of the National Unit for Security Cases, said:  The act [was] committed with the intent to harm the state of Syria and intimidate the people, thus the classification: terrorist crimes. The hard part is to clarify fully whether these men have been part of an armed group, and acted within the frames of the armed conflict, or not. The accused men came to Sweden, one from Iraq and one from Syria, as children, but grew up in Sweden and are Swedish citizens. They traveled to Syria in 2013, and joined one of the many Islamist terror groups there. According to the prosecution, they murdered two captured workers in an industrial area of Aleppo by slitting their throats. The prosecutor wrote that,  Al-Mandlawi and Sultan have both expressed delight at the deeds. During the trial, films of the executions were shown, but both men still denied having committed the crimes. Those present in court agreed that the films were among the most disturbing ever displayed in a Swedish court. First, they show a man having his throat slit, the blood gushing before he dies. Then, the other victim s head is severed from his body, and the killer holds up the severed head to loud cheers from the others. The court s chairman, Ralf G. Larsson, told the news agency, TT:  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air. The verdict was announced December 14: Both men were convicted of terrorist crimes and sentenced to life in prison. The verdict will be appealed, the defense lawyers said.Via: Gatestone Institute",1

" Michigan Republicans Pass Bill That Would Put Gay AND Straight Couples In Prison Conservative lawmakers are far too obsessed with how people have sex.In defiance of the Supreme Court, Michigan Republicans have passed a bill that makes oral and anal sex felonies punishable by up to 15 years in prison.State Senator Rick Jones, an old white right-wing guy who is apparently angry about all the sex he s not having, added the anti-sex language to SB 219, which is supposed to be an animal protection bill, included in a larger package of bills known as Logan s Law.Logan s Law is designed to block convicted animal abusers from owning any pets for five years, but Jones couldn t wait to use the bill to push his own belief that consenting adults who have oral and anal sex should be left to rot in a jail cell. He slipped in language revising the unconstitutional anti-sodomy law near the very end of the bill in a move that Jones probably hoped would go unnoticed.Here s a screenshot of Section 158 of Senate Bill 219.Despite calls for Jones to remove the section, he claims that to do so would hurt the animal protection bill as a whole. The minute I cross that line and I start talking about the other stuff, I won t even get another hearing. It ll be done,  Jones said.  Nobody wants to touch it. I would rather not even bring up the topic, because I know what would happen. You d get both sides screaming and you end up with a big fight that s not needed because it s unconstitutional. But Jones is the one who crossed the line in the first place by sneaking in his dream of outlawing oral and anal sex between humans into an animal protection bill. He s the one who willingly put the overall bill in jeopardy.Jones went on to claim that he believes the only way to repeal the sodomy ban is if the state passes a bill to do so, which he says he could  probably  vote for.The Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003, but conservatives across the country have been fighting to keep the laws on the books ever since. That includes Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia who tried to outlaw  carnal knowledge  between married couples in 2013 as he failed to become the state s governor.And just like Cuccinelli, it appears Jones is trying to insert Christian fundamentalist law into the civil law, which would create a legal clusterf*ck in this country since it would destroy privacy. In order to enforce such a law, it would take millions upon millions of dollars, a spying program, and a cop in every household to make sure women and men are only doing it missionary style and that their reproductive organs are in the place where they believe God intended them to be.In short, whenever Republicans say they support smaller government, they are full of shit, and so is Rick Jones. But I bet Justice Scalia is totally behind him all the way. Featured image from Facebook",1
"TRUMP’S RIGHT AGAIN AND OBAMA’S WRONG! The US Is Currently Blocking Funds To Somalia!  Donald Trump has announced he would force Mexico to pay for a  wall at the border by threatening to cut off billions of dollars in remittances sent by immigrants living in the United States.A snarky Obama scolded Donald Trump on his plan: The implications in regards to ending remittances, many of which by the way are from legal immigrants, and are from individuals who are sending money back to their families, are enormous. First of all, they re impractical  The notion that we re going to track every Western Union bit of money that is being sent to Mexico, uh, good luck with that. Then we got the implications for the Mexican economy. Which in turn if it is collapsing sends more immigrants north because they can t find jobs back in Mexico. Of course, Barack Obama is wrong about this, too.The US already cuts off remittance payments to Somalia. US News reported:Following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Congress passed stricter money-laundering regulations, which caused several large U.S. banks to close the accounts of Somali money transfer operators out of fears that funds would end up in the hands of terrorist groups like al-Shabab. Regulation in the U.K. and Australia also made it difficult for Somali money transfer operators to work there.Since then, operators have scraped by through partnerships with small and medium-sized U.S. banks that still allow funds to be sent to Somalia. But Merchants Bank of California, responsible for transferring between 60 and 80 percent of the total remittances sent to Somalia from the U.S., announced it would shut down such accounts in early February, and reportedly is still implementing the policy.The Mexican central bank reported that money sent home by Mexicans overseas hit nearly $24.8 billion last year. It is the largest foreign source of income to Mexico. Trump s remittance plan ought to help fund the border wall in no time.Via: GP",0
"FLASHBACK To Time When ABC News’ #LyinBrianRoss Tried To Tie Aurora, CO Mass Shooter To Tea Party [VIDEO] As the name of the suspect, identified as 24-year-old James Holmes, first emerged Friday morning, Ross reported on ABC News that he d found a web page for a  Jim Holmes  on a Colorado Tea Party site.Here a transcript of the discussion on live television between George Stephanopoulos and ABC News  lyin  Brian Ross: GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to go to Brian Ross here, because, Brian, you ve been looking- investigating the background of Jim Holmes here.

" Costco Raises Minimum Wage For Workers As Republicans Continue To Do Nothing Costco cares more about the American workforce than Republicans do.A few years ago, Costco answered the call to help struggling workers by raising the wages of their own employees to $12 an hour, nearly a full $5 increase above the federal minimum wage that House and Senate Republicans refuse to raise for the rest of the American people.The results swiftly proved that rewarding your employees and increasing their morale is a good business decision that propels a company forward and turns it into a more competitive one.As other corporations like Walmart saw sales sink, the quarterly income of Costco soared ahead.And now Costco is betting on their employees again by raising their wages by another dollar per hour.Costco announced the wage hike on Thursday in a move that could affect a large number of the 117,000 employees who work for the company.The move not only appears to be Costco s way of rewarding their employees, it appears to also be an answer to Walmart s grudging decision to raise wages for their own workers earlier this year.By raising wages for their own employees, Costco is competing with Walmart to draw new applicants as well as retain current workers.But Costco, unlike Walmart, has always treated their employees with dignity and respect.According to the Huffington Post,Costco has a reputation for being one of the better low-wage employers. It pays slightly more than its competitors (even before the wage increase), closes its doors for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day and provides health benefits to most of its employees, even those who make an hourly wage.Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continue to refuse to raise the federal minimum wage to help all American workers across the nation, which has resulted in states and cities raising wages on their own to address the struggle minimum wage workers have faced for decades.Most recently, the state of Oregon passed the highest minimum wage in the nation. In the next few years, Oregonians can expect to make up to $14.50 per hour, which is double the federal minimum wage.Now if only Republicans would stop obeying orders from their corporate masters, perhaps the rest of the American people could get the raise they need to take better care of their families without having to struggle near as much. Alas, it will probably require replacing them with Democrats to make it happen.Featured image from Wikimedia",0
"BREAKING: Muslim Clock Boy Family…Give Us $15 Million…Or Else Teaching kids all across America that bringing fake bombs to school on 9-11 really pays off Is it possible the radical Muslim family who became famous when their son took a fake bomb to school on 9-11 has discovered the cost of living in Qatar is higher than they anticipated? Or is it possible they just miss being in the spotlight?

"PATRIOT ARTIST’S LATEST TRIBUTE TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS: “You Are Not forgotten” [Video] Patriot artist John McNaughton just revealed his latest painting A tribute to the middle class and Trump supporters who are the forgotten people of America Remember when McNaughton revealed the painting during Obamas s presidency that depicted the president burning the Constitution?  ONE NATION UNDER SOCIALISM PLEASE CHECK OUT:  JOHN MCNAUGHTON FINE ART THE FORGOTTEN MAN    OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THAT INCREDIBLE PAINTING: John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government troubled and corrupt. The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism.Here s how McNaughton describes the painting:Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say,  What have you done?  Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper the U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama.THE FORGOTTEN MAN McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh?November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: Sean Hannity just purchased my painting  The Forgotten Man  to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House Go to www.jonmcnaughton.comVia: Conservative Treehouse",0
" Donald Trump Attacks Obama, Says He Understands The World ‘Much Better’ Than POTUS (VIDEO) It was just a few days ago that President Barack Obama absolutely destroyed Donald Trump on his controversial comments about nuclear power. Speaking to reporters at the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., Obama addressed the Republican front runner s remarks that more countries should have nuclear weapons, and gracefully called Trump out for being a complete idiot when he said: The person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally. It was completely true and obvious statement to most   but not Trump, who lives in a self-absorbed, denial-filled bubble. Always ready to start an immature feud with people far more qualified than himself, Trump has decided to hit back at Obama   in a way that makes him seem like even more of a moron. During a campaign stop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin yesterday, Trump literally decided to tell people that he understands  the world much better  than Obama. Seriously. Watch that ridiculous moment below:For Trump to blatantly say that he knows more about how the world works than Obama, who has been an extremely successful President for the last 8 years and done more for American than Republicans will ever give him credit for, is a hilarious and yet terrifying demonstration in Trump s obvious lack of self-awareness.Trump followed that comment with criticism for the President s treatment of Syrian refugees, making the argument that the United States should not be letting them enter the country. Trump said: We have no idea where they come from. They could be ISIS, and they might not be, but they could be ISIS. Did you ever notice the migration? There are so many young strong men. Where are the women and children?And I said don t let them in, we can t let them in. We ll build a safe zone, we ll build a free zone  We ll get the Gulf states to pay, because I don t want to pay. Currently, Trump is behind his rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Wisconsin   and if Cruz takes the state in its nominating contest on Tuesday, this could be a major turning point in the race for GOP nomination. If Cruz wins, he would get all of the Mid-western state s 42 delegates, making it much harder for Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates he needs to get nominated before the Republican national convention in July.

"BREAKING NEWS: “At The Direction Of The President” 22-Yr Old American Is Released From N. Korean Prison [VIDEO] 22-yr old American Otto Warmbier was arrested and imprisoned during Barack Obama s last term in office. He was released  at the direction  of President Trump. Although former President Barack Obama was unable to secure her release, after being in office for less than 4 months, President Trump was also able to secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who spent three years in an Egyptian jail over what human rights groups say were bogus charges.Otto Warmbier, the college student arrested, tried and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year for trying to swipe a souvenir from his hotel during a guided tour of the communist nation, has been released, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Tuesday.The 22-year-old Warmbier has served just over a year of his 15-year sentence   allegedly for taking down a sign of the late dictator Kim Jong Il while Warmbier was in the country with a tour group. As of Tuesday morning, Warmbier was on his way home to Cincinnati, although other details surrounding the dramatic events were not released. At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea,  Tillerson said.  Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family. The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained. Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier. Warmbier s parents, who have appeared on Fox News Channel in the past to plead for their son s release, expressed gratitude. FOX News",1
" New Poll Leaves Trump Camp Terrified As Even TEXAS Leans Hillary A new poll released from the Washington Post and SurveyMonkey has people scratching their heads. For the first time in four months, Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton, 46 to 44 percent, while simultaneously losing all swing states and the red states of Texas and Arizona.The poll, which was done from August 9 to September 1, and had close to 75,000 respondents, shows Trump losing Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado, Michigan and Arizona by two points to Clinton, with all of them being within 2 points of each other, 46-44 percent. Texas, the reddest of all red states in the union, was nabbed by Clinton with 1 point over Trump.How is that? People really, really hate Donald Trump:A comparison of the current survey with the 2008 Texas exit poll (there was no exit poll there in 2012) points to reasons the race appears close right now. Trump is performing worse than 2008 GOP nominee John McCain among both whites and Hispanics, while Clinton is doing slightly better than Obama.So in a national poll, Clinton is losing overall. But in all the states that matter (swing) and states never thought possible (Texas), she s winning.Although Trump is leading, the Post (which says the poll actually shows why Clinton has a clear advantage over Trump) has Clinton solidifying 244 electoral votes to Trump s 126 with 168 being tossups. Of those tossups, which includes 10 states, Clinton leads in six, ties with Trump in two, and Trump leads in two.While Trump supporters may be giddy and Clinton supporters worried, the Post actually contends that Trump is the one who should be worried:Overall, the results reflect Trump s strategy of maximizing support in older, whiter Midwestern states where his anti-free-trade message and appeals to national identity generally find more fertile ground. But his struggles elsewhere, including places that have long supported Republicans, illustrate the challenges of that strategy in more diverse states where his stances on immigration and some other positions have turned off Democrats, independents and many Republicans.>To win the election, Trump must quickly consolidate the Republican vote. With prominent Republicans declaring they will not support Trump and some even announcing they will back Clinton, this represents a major challenge for the GOP nominee. In the Post-SurveyMonkey poll, Clinton is winning 90 percent or more of the Democratic vote in 32 states, while Trump is at or above that level in just 13.It s not Hispanic, Latino, Black, or even female voters that are hurting Trump s chances   it s Republicans. The Obama coalition, which delivered two victories to President Obama in 2008 and 2012, have coalesced around Clinton in larger numbers. But now this election has offered something unique: Republicans are starting to come around to Clinton.With Trump losing the traditional coalition and now with Republicans, chances of him overtaking her are slim.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

" Traumatized Indiana Mom ‘Terrified’ After Becoming Target Of White Supremacists (VIDEO) Mia Frias-Russell, an African American mother of three, recently moved from Indianapolis, Indiana to the smaller town of Campbellsburg, nearly 600 miles away. According to City Data, the town has a population of less than 600 people and 97.4 percent of the residents are white.Ms. Russell says she has experienced various forms of racial discrimination since moving to the small Indiana town. During an interview with WTHR, she said people yell racial slurs at her while she s outside working in the yard.On July 20, the situation escalated. Ms. Russell stepped outside her Campbellsburg home that morning to find racial slurs sprayed all over her house. The words  N*gg*r go,  and  N*gg*r b*tch  were among the messages left for the mother and her three children. Her car was also painted with racial slurs. Authorities also believe that the vandals put sugar in the vehicle s gas tank.The terrified mom recorded a video of the aftermath, which she then uploaded to Facebook.  I m scared,  she said through her tears,  I don t know who could have done this.  Ms. Russell went on to say that the day before someone tried to run her car off the road.Watch the video below via YouTube:According to WTHR, Ms. Russell is renting her home in Campbellsburg. She is now trying to get out of her lease because she does not feel safe living in the area. She described the incident as both  traumatizing  and  terrifying. Authorities say they are looking for the people responsible for vandalizing Ms. Russell s home. According to ISP Sgt. Jerry Goodin those responsible will be charged with criminal mischief. The police may also upgrade the charges using the state s bias crime statute. Indiana s bias crime statute is similar to hate crimes statutes used to enhance criminal charges in other parts of the United States.It s unimaginable that, in the year 2016, this young mother does not feel safe driving down the street or even falling asleep in her own home. This is terrorism and those who were involved should be prosecuted as terrorists, not as vandals or petty criminals.Image credit; video screen capture via Mia Frias-Russell on Facebook",0

" Sarah Palin Faced Sexual Harassment At Fox News, But She Would Rather Protect The Network Than Say Something When high-profile women like Sarah Palin stay silent, it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted.As Fox News continues to reel in the aftermath of Bill O Reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with Roger Ailes  own sexual harassment scandal, former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there.But not Sarah Palin. Palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate.During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave Fox News was more about looking for different opportunities.TAPPER:  It sounds like you experienced something. PALIN:  I just   you know, it was just time to part ways and, and, you know, get   get out there in, I guess, a more diverse arena to express views. In fact, Palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at Fox News than she did for the perpetrators. If a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through. Sarah Palin collected a paycheck for five years (2010-2015) from Fox News as a contributor and analyst.The sexual harassment was there from the start.In 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if Palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview. Seriously.In 2011, Roger Ailes openly admitted that he only hired Palin  because she was hot and got ratings. Tucker Carlson, who has been with Fox News since 2009 and was just recently promoted to take Bill O Reilly s place, posted an incredibly sexist tweet about Palin in 2011 that he was forced to delete. Palin s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander in Milfistan,  Carlson wrote.In other words, things haven t changed much at all at Fox News. The network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one.If Palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network. And she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it. She is protecting Fox News by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk.Palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite. As a strong woman, I say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change. But Palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at Fox News, and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle.This is why Sarah Palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
"BOOM! SMUG NEWSPAPER EDITORS Endorse Hillary…Phone Lines Blow Up With Subscription CANCELLATIONS Smug liberal newspapers and tv networks have paid a heavy price  for their criticism of Trump. Americans think of Trump as the underdog in this race and there s nothing worse than piling on the underdog. For these liberal hacks who have been writing their leftist opinions as opposed to real news for decades, they re about to find out what it means to be considered irrelevant by their former readers The subscription cancellations were coming every 10 minutes. Angry readers have been calling in droves. We re feeling the weight of our history,  Phil Boas, the editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Until it endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, the newspaper, founded in 1890, had never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president.In endorsing Mrs. Clinton, The Republic s editorial was, by any interpretation, scathing toward her opponent, Donald J. Trump.  Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads,  the editorial says at one point.  That s beneath our national dignity. The papers lay out different reasons for supporting Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump   his lack of political experience versus her established political career, his outbursts and insults versus her steadiness   and some are perhaps more repudiations of Mr. Trump than glowing endorsements of Mrs. Clinton, whose faults are also cited.For some readers, however, the endorsements proved a step too far.  Certainly, we ve paid a price for our presidential recommendation,  Mike Wilson, the editor of The Dallas Morning News, told Poynter this month.Mr. Boas of The Arizona Republic said he expected  a lot of cancellations,  pointing to cancellations at The Cincinnati Enquirer, which like The Republic, is owned by Gannett.But he said financial considerations were  never a factor  for the newspaper s nine-person editorial board.  It was more of a curiosity,  he said.  We know we re doing the right thing. We feel very good about this decision.  New York TimesGood luck with that whole  feeling good  thing when your paper is shut down because you can t pay your liberal editors ",0
" Terrorist Jon Ritzheimer Uses Sobbing Daughters To Beg For Money Before Turning Himself In Jon Ritzheimer, infamous hater of Muslims and one of the terrorists responsible for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, managed to escape the arrests made Tuesday by federal agents of ringleader Ammon Bundy and his band of right-wing nutjobs.According to a post on his Facebook page, Ritzheimer had returned to his home in Arizona to visit with his family:That was, of course, the real reason Ritzheimer was part of the occupation to begin with: Money. After his armed protest of a mosque in Arizona failed to bring in the $10 million he said he needed for  security upgrades,  Ritzheimer began appearing at idiotic  movements  all over the place. His last was the Bundy fiasco in Oregon. Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different. Before turning himself in, he released this video on his Facebook page, along with yet another plea for help for  legal fees  and for help for his family, who he clearly can t support.Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different.

" Internet SHREDS Trump For Dog Whistling Neo-Nazis With Anti-Hillary Star Of David Post (TWEETS) The only people who think all Jewish people are rich and shrewd with money are anti-Semitic racists, so therefore it should come as no surprise that this is yet another group of bigots that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump would try to appeal to in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. No, Hillary Clinton is not Jewish, but that didn t stop The Donald. You see, he is jealous because when it comes to fundraising, Hillary Clinton is winning. While she has raised roughly $68.5 million in funds during June, while Trump s campaign is broke.Instead of raising money or staying quiet on the issue, Trump, in his own unique brand of childish, racist buffoonery, Trump tweeted out a  Crooked Hillary  image that included a Star of David and a pile of money.

"WOW! RUSSIAN LAWYER Who Met With Donald Trump Jr. Seen In Photo With Person Tied To Obama Only 8 Days After Meeting Much to the dismay of mainstream media journalists, Donald Trump Jr. released all email communication regarding his meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya today on Twitter. Meanwhile, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has told NBC News that she met with Donald Trump Jr. to discuss sanctions, that she did not have any Kremlin connections, and that she did not hand over information about Hillary s campaign.She confirmed her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. was about Russian adoptions in the US.But is there more to Natalia Veselnitskaya than meets the eye? Who is she? Does she have ties to Obama and the Democratic Party? Was the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. a set up?According to The Gateway Pundit: The law firm where Veselnitskaya is listed as managing partner, Kamerton Consulting, is based in a Moscow suburb and does not even have a website.A staff member at Kamerton told The Associated Press Veselnitskaya was unavailable for comment on Monday.Her office in Moscow may be a shell. There is no working phone, email or website.Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump s senior staff and Veselnitskaya and  does not know who that is. Peskov said, No, we don t know who that is and obviously we can t monitor all meetings Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad. Now this Natalia Veselnitskaya was sitting with Obama s Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, 8 days after cold-contacting Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.Here s a shot showing who appears to be Natalia Veselnitskaya, sitting behind  from the June 14, 2016 Congressional hearing on Russia and the Ukraine.Natalia Veselnitskaya photo:MORE  That looks like Emin Agalarov sitting next to Natalia Veselnitskaya. He was mentioned in Donald Trump Jr s statement this morning. Emin helped set up the meeting with Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya was also connected to Fusion GPS, the DNC opposition research firm that produced the fraudulent and discredited Trump Dossier.So why was Veselnitskaya hanging out with Obama officials just days after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?And why was Veselnitskaya given a privileged seat up front during the Congressional hearing?

"WATCH: AMAZING THING HAPPENED When H.S. Valedictorian Stepped Up To Podium After ATHEIST Group Told Grads They Could No Longer Recite The Lord’s Prayer A 70-year tradition at East Liverpool High School was removed from the graduation ceremony, but students weren t letting it go easily.The Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation, which advocates for separation of church and state, got wind of the school s prayer tradition. They told East Liverpool administrators they needed to stop their choir from singing the Lord s Prayer at graduation.Rather than fighting legal battles, the school removed the song from Sunday s program. But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change. I know a lot of my student body was uncomfortable with it, just because it is tradition to have prayer at our school,  said Cami Post, class of 2016 vice president. The idea of one person or 2 or 3 standing up and saying they don t want prayer back in school or even singing or reciting is sad,  said Pastor Rodney Ohler, Salineville Assembly of God.Ohler and members of his church stood outside to support keeping the prayer in school.   WTOV9The students appeared to be going along with the order until the valedictorian of the East Liverpool graduating class signaled the class from the podium Watch video below to see the graduating students pull a fast one on the atheist group who felt compelled to deprive them of their 70-year old tradition: ",1
" Trump Is Building Literal, Actual Concentration Camps For Undocumented Immigrants It s beginning. While some dismissed Donald Trump s campaign promises to ban Muslims from entering the country, dismantle our country s healthcare, build a giant goddamn motherfucking wall to keep brown people from entering the country, and every other horrific thing you can think of and more as  just words  he was using to get stupid people to vote for him, he meant every single one of them   and he s been proving it.One of President Asterisk s first acts was an executive order that is the beginning of his efforts to dismantle Obamacare. He followed up by signing away our environment and authorizing the building of two controversial pipelines, stripping federal funds from international health organizations that so much as mention abortion (in an order conveniently following millions of women lining the streets to protest him). He then withdrew us from a major trade agreement without a single thought about the repercussions, began funneling our tax dollars into his stupid wall, ordered a weekly report on crimes committed by  aliens  and banned Muslims from seven countries he hates from entering the country.Trump even authorized the building of new camps in which undocumented immigrants could be concentrated   for a limited time, of course   until they could be deported (I feel like there s a term for these things, but I can t quite place it). The Washington Post reports: The presidential directives signed Wednesday aim to create more detention centers, add thousands of Border Patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws. One order calls for the  immediate construction of a physical wall. In short, if you re a member of this group that Trump considers undesirable, you ll be sent to one of these camps and any city that might otherwise harbor you will face extreme penalties for doing so. We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,  Trump told a crowd of DHS employees Wednesday.  Beginning today, the United States gets control of its borders. Trump also vowed to investigate alleged voter fraud in blue states   particularly in  urban  (that s right-wing slang for  black ) areas   so he can prove once and forgodamnall that he actually won the popular vote, because he really is that petty.It hasn t even been a week since Trump took office and he has already made it clear that he has declared war on the American people. The question remains: just how much are we going to take of this bullshit?Make no mistake about it: people will die in Trump s camps and his supporters will applaud.This. Is. Not. OK.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",0
" American Airlines Throws Ivy League Economist Off Plane For Doing Math Ivy League economist Guido Menzio has reportedly been removed from an American Airlines flight and interrogated after being found in possession of algebra.Menzio had been seated next to a female passenger on the plane who became suspicious that her dark-skinned fellow traveler was writing in a script with which she was unfamiliar. The female passenger then reported Menzio immediately and secretly to cabin crew as a suspected terrorist. She left the plane, citing illness as her excuse. Meanwhile, other passengers began to grumble at the delay. A short while later, Menzio was also escorted from the plane on grounds he would only be made aware of later.When security began to interrogate him about the woman who had left   so far as Menzio knew   due to illness, he believed he was playing a role in supporting their inquiries as to her condition. But they then revealed it was Menzio who was under suspicion and being interrogated as a suspect terrorist.As the Washington Post reports:Had the crew or security members perhaps quickly googled this good-natured, bespectacled passenger before waylaying everyone for several hours, they might have learned that he  Guido Menzio is a young but decorated Ivy League economist. And that he s best known for his relatively technical work on search theory, which helped earn him a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania and stints at Princeton and Stanford s Hoover Institution.They might even have discovered that last year he was awarded the Carlo Alberto Medal, given to the best Italian economist under 40. That s right: He s Italian, not Middle Eastern, or whatever heritage usually gets racially profiled on flights these days.The suspicious scrawl which so perturbed the female passenger and flight crew was nothing more than math. Algebra to be precise.The renowned economist said of his experience in a Facebook post:It s a bit funny. It s a bit worrisome. The lady just looked at me, looked at my writing of mysterious formulae, and concluded I was up to no good. Because of that an entire flight was delayed by 1.5 hours.Trump s America is already here. It s not yet in power though. Personally, I will fight back.Manzi becomes the latest among a litany of Muslim and non-Muslim people to have their lives interrupted and they character made suspect by the sort of casual racism and fear promoted by not only Donald Trump, but much of the mainstream media and conservative political class. After the horrors of McCarthy era America, we would hope the nation would have learned a valuable lesson on restraint. It appears not.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Penn Arts and Sciences",0

"TRUMP BEGINS DISMANTLING Of OBAMACARE With Today’s Executive Order…Nancy Pelosi’s Response Is Hilarious! Today, President Trump came one step closer to dismantling Obamacare. He signed an executive order that would allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines. The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS for HEALTHCARE!  https://t.co/mz5fdveTVh pic.twitter.com/dDZLsKuNSe  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017Congressional Democrats said Thursday that President Trump s executive order to relax insurance rules is the latest evidence of Republican  sabotage  against Obamacare.The president signed the order that directs federal agencies to examine regulations that would make it easier for people to band together to get  association health plans  and buy more short-term insurance. Democrats quickly criticized the order as a back door to attack protections for people with pre-existing conditions and increase  junk  insurance plans. I do know it is a sabotage of the Affordable Care Act and quite frankly a disservice to the American people,  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Tuesday.She also said Trump knows  very little about healthcare legislation.   Washington ExaminerPerhaps a little trip down memory lane is in order for Nancy. Remember when Nancy Pelosi coined her most memorable line in the long list of memorable Nancy Pelosi lines?  Remember when Nancy attempted to explain the Obamacare legislation to a large audience, telling them,  But we have to pass the bill, so that you can, uh, find out what s in it. ?Even one of her most reliable media allies, David Gregory of NBC News, who was clearly on the same team as Nancy, questioned her sanity and most especially, her knowledge of what was in the Obamacare bill, following her curious remarks:We re pretty sure that most Americans are more confident in President Trump s knowledge of the benefits to Americans, once they are able to purchase insurance across state lines than they were in Nancy s ability to understand the 20,000 page Obamacare legislation.",0
"BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video] Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",0

" WikiLeaks Has Sunk To New Journalistic Lows – They’re Bribing People For Dirt It s not illegal, but it s long been considered unethical for journalists to pay their sources. It still happens, but generally by tabloids. WikiLeaks  Julian Assange believes that his is not a tabloid, and in fact, he believes that he is so far above mainstream media sources, that it s okay for him to pay for stories, which is exactly what he s doing, trying to dig up dirt on both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Police rewards product results. So do journalistic rewards,  a spokesperson for Sunshine Press, of which Wikileaks is a project, told Huffington Post in an email.  Those who take the truth seriously leave no stone unturned to find it. As for the ethics, well, WikiLeaks breaths rarified air: Some lesser publications have poor quality control and as a consequence are not able to maintain accuracy when financial incentives are involved. Or frankly, even when they are not,  the spokesperson said, pointing to the New York Times publishing false information about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction as an example.  WikiLeaks  vetting process is strong enough not to be affected by an increase in source contributions. Wait, what? WikiLeaks has a vetting process? This is the same organization that published more than 80 strains of malware in its most recent email dump. Oh, and there s a reason they re called email dumps   WikiLeaks doesn t vet, they simply dump, leaving other journalists to sort through to find the real information. While the New York Times certainly doesn t deserve the level of respect they had before the Iraq War, I can say with certainty that they ve never infected my computer with malware.This isn t the first time WikiLeaks has paid to play. Last year, they offered $100,000 for information relating to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Earlier in the month, WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for anyone with information that might link the murder of a DNC staffer in Washington D.C. to the Hillary Clinton campaign. All they ended up doing was fueling Alex Jones-type conspiracy theorists.Assange has received a lot of criticism from those on the left, claiming that he s trying to put his thumb on the scale of our electoral process in an attempt to defeat Clinton. I m sure his claim that he s also going after Trump is a convincing cover for that, but think about it. Assange is offering $100,000. Trump could easily double or triple that to keep someone quiet. Yes, the Clintons have money, but not Trump money.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images.",0

" Watch Heartbreaking Cries From An Abused Puppy As She Is Shown Love For The First Time (VIDEO) A video of a terrified and previously abused puppy being shown love for the first time by her handler has captured the hearts and minds of many. The puppy, Priscilla, is crying out as a caretaker pets her. Not knowing how to react to the love she s shown for the first time, Priscilla cries out in anguish and fear but as the video progresses, amazing things happen.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogpZHkfN2I]Defenseless and petrified, Priscilla keeps snapping her head back to the hand of the caretaker, anxiously anticipating what the caretaker will do next. Watching Pricilla s trauma gives the viewer an idea of the magnitude of abuse Priscilla previously suffered.However, after a few strokes around her head, eyes, and ears, Priscella slowly yet surely calms. Later on in the video, Priscella is in the arms of her caretaker and she seems both comfortable and reassured that the people around her mean no harm.The last part of the video shows a happy Priscilla playing with her handler and another dog. She is bright, happy, and physically healthy, unlike the Priscilla we saw in the previous video. Not much is known about Priscilla other than the clear abuse she clearly incurred from her previous owner and that she is from Romania.It is striking what a little love and affection can do. If we treated all creatures in this manner, including each other, one can only imagine how wonderful the world we live in would be.Featured Image via YouTube Screen Capture from Daily Mail ",1

" Carrier To Employees: Donald Trump Lied, We’re Still Sending 1,300 Jobs To Mexico While Donald Trump may have bribed Carrier into keeping some 800 jobs in the United States with millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives   a dangerous precedent, as companies now know they only need to threaten to move out of the United States to get massive gifts from the Trump administration   one thing he doesn t even acknowledge is that more jobs will still be going to Mexico than will stay in the United States.In a deal that even stalwart Trump supporter calls a  hallmark of corruption  and  crony capitalism,  Trump and Pence offered the company $7 million to keep a small portion of the jobs they planned to move across the border in Indiana. The problem is that the company will still be moving 1,300 jobs Trump and his crew refuse to speak about. But Carrier was forthright with employees in a companywide letter explaining The Donald s attempt to deceive the American public into thinking he was doing some actual good. While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,  the letter tells employees. Carrier explains that regardless of any deal with Trump they intend to  move forward with previously unannounced plans  to relocate 1,300 jobs to Mexico by the end of the year. We recognize that this has been very difficult for your families,  the letter says, praising employees for continuing to work even knowing the company intended to f*ck them over with or without Donald Trump s input.  We greatly appreciate this and sincerely thank you for all your efforts.

"JUST IN: DISGRACED DEMOCRAT HARRY REID Funneled MASSIVE Taxpayer Funds To Donor For UFO Research Through SECRET Defense Department Program The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   FOX News",1

" Wife Of Arrested Russian Hacker Just Spoke Out, And Trump Is Shaking In His Boots The wife of a Russian hacker who was arrested in Spain has spoken out, confirming that her husband, Pyotr Levashov, was (allegedly) involved in hacking our election. I asked for a warrant or some papers, they said they showed them to my husband,  Maria Levashova says.  With my husband, I talked to the commissariat by phone, he said that he was shown some piece of paper in Spanish without a seal and his photo in poor quality. Something was said about the fact that the virus my husband allegedly created was related to Trump s victory in the elections. Levashov, better recognized as  Peter Severa  and  Peter of the North  in hacking circles, is well-known in the cybercrime community. Krebs on Security reports:According to numerous stories here at KrebsOnSecurity, Levashov was better known as  Severa,  the hacker moniker used by a pivotal figure in many Russian-language cybercrime forums. Severa was the moderator for the spam subsection of multiple online communities, and in this role served as the virtual linchpin connecting virus writers with huge spam networks   including some that Severa allegedly created and sold himself.Levashov is currently listed as #7 in the the world s Top 10 Worst Spammers list maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus. The U.S. Justice Department maintains that Severa was the Russian partner of Alan Ralsky, a convicted American spammer who specialized in  pump-and-dump  spam schemes designed to artificially inflate the value of penny stocks.Levashov allegedly went by the aliases Peter Severa and Peter of the North (Pyotr is the Russian form of Peter). My reporting indicates that   in addition to spamming activities   Severa was responsible for running multiple criminal operations that paid virus writers and spammers to install  fake antivirus  software. So-called  fake AV  uses malware and/or programming tricks to bombard the victim with misleading alerts about security threats, hijacking the PC until its owner either pays for a license to the bogus security software or figures out how to remove the invasive program.There is ample evidence that Severa is the cybercriminal behind the Waledac spam botnet, a spam engine that for several years infected between 70,000 and 90,000 computers and was capable of sending approximately 1.5 billion spam messages a day.In 2010, Microsoft launched a combined technical and legal sneak attack on the Waledac botnet, successfully dismantling it. The company would later do the same to the Kelihos botnet, a global spam machine which shared a great deal of computer code with Waledac.The connection between Waledac/Kelihos and Severa is supported by data leaked in 2010 after hackers broke into the servers of pharmacy spam affiliate program SpamIt. According to the stolen SpamIt records, Severa   this time using the alias  Viktor Sergeevich Ivashov    brought in revenues of $438,000 and earned commissions of $145,000 spamming rogue online pharmacy sites over a 3-year period.Severa also was a moderator of Spamdot.biz (pictured in the first screenshot above), a vetted, members-only forum that at one time attracted almost daily visits from most of Russia s top spammers. Leaked Spamdot forum posts for Severa indicate that he hails from Saint Petersburg, Russia s second-largest city.Sevara is currently in custody in Barcelona, but is subject to an extradition request by the United States. Spanish news website El Confidencial also confirms that the arrest was related to hacking that helped Donald Trump  win  the election.With Trump screaming FAKE NEWS every time new facts come out about his collusion with Vladimir Putin to take the Oval Office by any means necessary   even if it does involve some Russian hackers, an aggressive propaganda campaign, and probably a couple Russian pee pee hookers   this news is not good for him. We can fully expect a meltdown on some sort on Twitter as soon as Breitbart reports on the arrest.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",1
"BREAKING…Internal Memo From OBAMA’S Corrupt EPA: FLINT NOT WORTH “Going Out On A Limb For” Wow! Bernie and Hillary have been making hay over the Flint water crisis for months now, using the crisis to secure votes from the black community.  Leftists have been converging on the city like rats in search of the last peice of cheese on earth and now we have proof that Obama s EPA knew about the crisis, but didn t think the people of Flint were worthy of protecting.An internal Environmental Protection Agency memo showed officials didn t think  Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for  while residents of the Michigan town drank lead-contaminated water.House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz presented an internal memo between the EPA official who oversees Michigan, a branch manager in the EPA s Region 5, the associate director of the water division for Region 5 and an EPA environmental engineer about the water crisis in Flint.In the memo, one of the officials   it wasn t clear who based on the screen shown by Chaffetz   said Flint wasn t worth helping. Perhaps she already knows all this, but I m not so sure Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for,  the memo stated.Chaffetz was incredulous at the memo. Are you kidding me?  he said, looking at Susan Hedman, the former director of EPA s Region 5, which oversees much of the Midwest including Michigan. Why isn t Flint the community they go to?

" White House Says It’s Releasing Hillary’s Private Concession Call To Trump In Bid To Humiliate Her Trump s emotionally unbalanced social media director and close friend Dan Scavino had what can only be described as a mental break and is now threatening to publish a video of the private concession call she placed to Trump (and appears to have been answered by Kellyanne Conway).To do so would be not only a major ethical violation but would break with the long-standing tradition of the winners showing an ounce of graciousness towards their opponents. Trump and his team apparently have no qualms with stooping this low. If there is a point of indignity even they will not cross, they have yet to reach it.Scavino has long relished in his role as Trump s nastiest bulldog. His position as White House social media director was handed to him, not due to experience or expertise but because he was Trump s golf caddie. In a White House bursting with nepotism and corruption, Scavino might be the least qualified person around   an impressive feat. He is also known for his viciousness and an unhinged streak of petty attacks on his or Trump s perceived enemies follows wherever he goes. Clinton, who won the popular vote by several million, still irritates Trump and therefore she is an enemy Scavino feels he needs to destroy.For his part, Scavino claims he is being trolled by Hillary supporters. A notable coward, he couldn t take the heat and began melting down on social media. (The irony of Trump s social media director being unable to handle being on social media should not be lost on anyone.)After posting this nonsensical  I m not mad, you re mad!  tweet, Scavino followed it up with the promise to release Hillary s concession phone call.Love @AlexBWall & team Clinton trolling me (b/c they have nothing else going on.) All experts & gurus over there  . that simply got owned! pic.twitter.com/R8so2rZCwN  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) May 9, 2017Screen shot via @KellyannePolls cell phone- of Huma's call at 2:30amE .6 months ago. I have on video & will share that in the near future. pic.twitter.com/Mzy2o8XXwQ  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) May 9, 2017It s hard to quantify the sheer level of petty vindictiveness going on in the White House. Trump s team of enablers and yes-men run from one squabble to the next. Very little time appears to be spent on actual governance, with a lot of their energy being consumed with in-fighting. Bannon is fighting with Jared Kushner. Kushner is fighting with Priebus. Kellyanne Conway is missing? McMasters is fighting with Bannon. Instead of leading by example, Trump is off golfing or wandering around aimlessly with a copy of the election map under his arm. Trump ran an experiment: What would happen if I filled the nation s highest office with the least reputable, most angry, insecure people in the country? The answer: This shitshow is exactly what happens.The only goal of Scavino releasing the private tape of Trump and Clinton s phone call is to personally humiliate Hillary Clinton. There is no political, social, or practical reason to do this. Even by the admittedly low standards of restraint and goodwill on display by Trump s White House, this is disgusting. Sadly, with Trump consumed by his efforts to smear Sally Yates, it appears unlikely that he will intervene and save his administration from yet another self-inflicted blow to their own dignity.I would say this is the foxes running the henhouse but it would be unfair to suggest foxes lack this amount of shame.Featured image via CNN",0

" Paul Ryan Is So Unpopular Even 8th Graders Refuse To Pose In Pic With Him (VIDEO) House Speaker Paul Ryan is hugely unpopular, garnering only a 29 percent approval rating. Apparently, 8th graders disapprove of him, too. While on a field trip in Washington, D.C. on Friday, about half of the 8th-grade students from a South Orange Middle School refused to do a photo-op with Ryan. Instead, the nearly 100 students opted to sit in a parking lot across the street while the remaining students took part in the photo op, according to Mashable.Elissa Malespina, a school librarian and the parent one of the eighth graders who declined the photo op, said that she is proud of her son. I am so proud of my son and 1/2 the 8th grade at South Orange Middle School,  Malespina wrote on Facebook.  They went to D.C. on a field trip and toured the Capitol building. The kids had a chance to have their picture taken with Paul Ryan and over half the class choose not to, including my son! What a powerful statement. I can t take a picture with someone who supports a budget that would destroy public education and would leave 23 million people without healthcare,  Matthew Malespina, a student at the school, told The Village Green. It s not just a picture,  student Matthew told ABC News.  It s being associated with a person who puts his party before his country. I think that taking the picture represents that you agree with the same political views and I don t agree with his political views so I chose not to be in it,  eighth grader Wendy Weeks said.To some of the students, it had to do with Ryan s association with Donald Trump. I didn t want to be in [the picture] because he believes in most of what Trump believes in,  Louisa Maynard-Parisi, told The Village Green.Even though their politics might be different from Ryan s, other students decided to participate. I thought it would be interesting to see one of the nation s lawmakers in person even if I strongly disagree with many of his views,  said Alex Klint, one of the 8th-grader s said.Residents weighed in with conflicted feelings. I m sort of torn on this (although each kid has the right to make this choice),  wrote one SOMA resident.  Even though I totally disagree with everything he stands for, he is a legitimately elected official and represents our government at work. Meeting our representatives is an honor for a kid at least for what the office stands for (even if the person occupying that chair is less than honorable). And I do feel if there had been some conservative school where the kids refused to pose with President Obama, we would have been appalled by that,  the resident added.Matthew s mother told the paper,  It is his right as a citizen to do so and I commend him and his fellow students for doing so in a respectful way.

"Hillary’s ‘Russian Hack’ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season  Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThe longer this soap opera drags on, it s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not  hack  into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, however, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  Putin is hacking the US elections.  In response, the President is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyber-activity  tools.Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying, We re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.   Presumably, he s referring to a cyber  counter attack  by Washington.It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US?What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington s new anti-Russia movement.On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote,  The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  Russian hack  talking point was purely political, but then again, who s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media.You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words,  comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance.  If you ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?  said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami.Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia   not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system,  we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: The bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10,  Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like,  Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French:  bottom of the bag ) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle? It s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election.Behind Clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton s campaign manager John Podesta   giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out,  Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political,  cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima, the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  Russian government hacks    provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike. No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike s word for it.IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security.The Post s Nakashima then added: The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,  the joint statement said.   We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. Moscow s press secretary s reply:  This is some sort of nonsense,  said Dmitry Peskov.Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that Russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence, other than speculative guesswork, has been presented.Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  Russia did it,  thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona   are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the  Intelligence Community    all agreed that Russia did it. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,  said Clinton.  I find that deeply disturbing. What s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton s 17 agencies :Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta s emails? Answer: nothing.The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016. The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda.In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington s  flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party s decree that Russia is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney, when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are  hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the FBI also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the Trump team with Russia.  Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven t come up with anything.To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government s much vaunted Intelligence Community. Of course, that s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq s imaginary  Winnebagos of Death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks.For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  Washington Intelligence,  I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now,  No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We re not like that. No, this time it s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!  In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim s notorious  Bureau 121  hacked into Sony Pictures. This isn t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121.  Just like with today s  Russian Hack  theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the  Russian Hack  claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike.Jumping the SharkAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative.Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the West.   Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering  with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back.The biggest impact of @wikileaks? Shining a spotlight on Russia s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence  seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as  proof  that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign s desperate claims. It was embarrassing.They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead.Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger. The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video   their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization.Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened.To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,  said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race.  I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,  said Clinton.The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it.Party MeltdownWasserman Schultz s replacement didn t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches   showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to Hillary Clinton. A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN s Jake Tapper. A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.  (Source: Daily Caller)Brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: In addition, it was also revealed how CNN s head political commentator, Gloria Borger, was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the Clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage. You d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN s election coverage.Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5  400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016Worse Than WatergatePerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury   is the FBI s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. There s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe   a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times.So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia, and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top   to the President himself.What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton s server  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  The President s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server    maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it.Sure, he s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club   caught out lying to the American people.On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News)It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action   that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case.On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case   currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a  sexting  scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik. Who is Kadzik?  Zero Hedge reports: Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary s Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik. Oh, and if that wasn t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as  best friends. FOX News confirms: Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,  Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks.To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it.Russia   The Party ScapegoatFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting:  Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville, was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused  the KGB  working with Republicans to  hijack the election  during his wild rant on MSNBC. I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That s what I think,  said Carville.Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB, and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991.These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence   unlike the Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that  Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.  They ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep   a perfect double entendre.The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for  sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry, Samantha Power, and John Kirby, already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown   that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed  rebels  Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki.With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks   and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said,  We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that.What s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although  Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17,  and  Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind.That said, it s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of  Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.  When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders. Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 ElectionOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era.Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere   if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry.Still, we re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington   before it s too late.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",1
" WATCH: Pat Robertson Gets INCREDIBLY Offensive In Full-Throated Defense Of Trump How much more depraved does a so-called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real Christian?Because one would think that conservative  Christians  of all people would be absolutely opposed to Donald Trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on Friday.But evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting Trump as long as it means Hillary Clinton does not become president.Family Research Council head Tony Perkins made that clear on Saturday when he STILL voiced support for Trump despite his  grab them by the p*ssy  remark. My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the Constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years,  Perkins said.Ralph Reed of Faith and Freedom Coalition basically said the same thing. Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal. Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns. In other words, Trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative  Christian  leaders.And that includes 700 Club preacher Pat Robertson, who called Trump s behavior  macho  while continuing to endorse him for president. A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho,  Robertson said on Monday.  And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off,  Okay, he s dead, now you ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign. Robertson proceeded to declare Trump the winner of Sunday night s debate and called him  a Phoenix  rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign.Here s the video via YouTube.These hypocrites have been whining for years about how America needs a president who shares their so-called biblical values, but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the White House who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation, even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office. These people are NOT Christians. They merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church.Featured Image: Screenshot",1

"STUNNER! FLORIDA TRUMP EVENT: Former Haitian Senate President Drops CLINTON BOMBSHELL Exposing Unbelievable Corruption [VIDEO] Former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq exposes all of the dirty dealings of the Clinton s in Haiti while he was still in office. Donald Trump to his credit, allowed him to speak his mind and expose to the world what kind of criminals are attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq also claims he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to  side  with the Clinton Administration and he would  be the richest man in Haiti. He also suggests that Hillary Clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claims they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti. Watch this stunning confession of bribery, and threats during the Clinton presidency when Bill tried to oust the regime in Haiti. ",1
"Exposed: The US is an Oligarchy Ruled by Billionaires and Dictators  Eric Zuesse Off GuardianEven for the post of U.S. President, the preferences of the American people have only a marginal, if any, impact upon the selection of the person to occupy that post.In Colorado s Republican race to win delegates to the Republican National Convention for selecting the Republican Presidential nominee, there was no primary, and there was no caucus.As the Republican magazine National Review headlined on April 11th, attempting to justify what a Republican wag had just headlined as  Cruz Celebrates Voterless Win : Donald Trump Laid a Colorado Goose Egg because He Was Disorganized and Amateurish. Their argument (since they campaign for any Republican but Trump) was: he lost  because he was disorganized and amateurish  not because he had been cheated by the Party-hierarchy.National Review explained that in the process which had been set up by the Colorado Republican Party (it s set up by each individual state s Republican Party, not by the National Republican Party),  delegates to the national convention would be selected at congressional-district conventions and the Republican s [sic] state convention , and this was done in order to give Colorado s delegates more flexibility,  not done in order to require delegates to reflect the Republican (or any other) electorate in Colorado (since NR doesn t like even its own Party s electorate).This was the explanation that was provided by that magazine, which backs Cruz, and which has been campaigning ferociously against Trump.  Their article was built upon, and extensively quoted, the justifications put forth by one particular Cruz delegate, who said, The grassroots made the decision that Ted Cruz was the best candidate for us, and the grassroots made the decision to come out for Cruz and absolutely swept the table. He called it  our caucus system.  Whatever it was, it shut out all rank-and-file Republican voters, and left everything to people like himself, who could afford to do this: You have to put in the work, you have to put in the effort, and you have to do it months ahead of time. In other words: only Republican Party activists in Colorado could participate in selecting the delegates who would participate in selecting the Republican nominee. No one else was allowed to.  Their conception of the Colorado Republican Party is that it s only the Party s activists; and, if you re not a Republican activist, you have no say.It s as if to say:Only people who work in the government can have a say in how the government is to be run.  It s for insiders only and, of course, indirectly it s for whomever pays those insiders and so enables them to  put in the work  to participate.National Public Radio had a different take on this matter.  Steve Inskeep headlined there GOP Delegate: Trump Primary Wins  Absolutely Irrelevant  At Convention.  He interviewed Curly Haughland, a member of the Republican National Committee who lives in North Dakota, and who said: No matter what the popular belief might be,   there is no connection between primaries and the actual convention. Well, that s putting it rather bluntly. Haughland also said: Cited the GOP s convention Rules 37 and 38. He interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may  vote their conscience.  The rules do not explicitly say this. Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll-call votes. However, Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be  bound  by the  unit rule, meaning that delegates from a state can t all be forced to vote the same way. Another of Haughland s points is indisputable: When the convention convenes,  he said,  the delegates adopt their own rules, which haven t been adopted yet.  There is a standard template for conventions, but delegates could tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. In other words: the National Republican Committee says that all of the delegates to the Republican National Convention are allowed to  tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. So: the delegates at that Convention won t actually be representing anyone but themselves there. They are entirely free to push for anyone whom they personally want to win the Republican U.S. Presidential nomination.They re not bound, not even on the first ballot. They might pretend to be, if they feel a need to put on a show that looks  democratic , but any who don t feel the need to make such a pretense, can do whatever they want on the first ballot, just like on any successive ballot. They are free; all of them are free. It s only the electorate who aren t   they re not represented, at all.What about on the Democratic side?  Wyoming had held its Democratic Party caucuses on April 9, and there really were caucuses.  Two days later, CNN headlined Wyoming Democratic Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Picks Up Another Win , and reported: Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses Saturday, providing his campaign with one more jolt of momentum before the race against Hillary Clinton heads east. Even so, he made no gains in Clinton s delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result.    On April 12th a youtube video was posted, MSNBC Morning Host Admits The  Whole Voting System Is Rigged  After Bernie Get s Cheated! Here the co-hosts had a conversation about the results:  Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by twelve points, 56 to 44,   He wins by twelve points.  The accompanying image showed the delegate-count, in this contest that Sanders had won by 56% to 44%:  18 total.  Hillary Clinton 11, Bernie Sanders 7.  It wasn t 7 to 7, after all.Though Sanders had outscored Clinton by 12%, it was worse than even-steven for him; he had actually lost by 11 delegates to 7 delegates.  This system is so rigged!  said one host.  There s absolutely no reason any of those people voted,  said the other.A Hillary Clinton supporter was the  expert  on the panel, and he said,  It s not rigged. These are the rules.  He wasn t given time to explain that fine point   or how  the rules  were necessarily  not rigged. Also on April 12th, Public Radio International s Todd Zwillich headlined (falsely), Six Reasons Bernie Sanders Won Wyoming, But Still Tied in the Delegate Race , and Zwillig failed to explain that word  Tied.  He opened:  How, many of you ask, could Bernie have won Wyoming 56 percent to Hillary s 44 percent, but still split the delegates with her 50-50?  Then, he repeated that there had supposedly been  The 7-7 split,  but he also said  Wyoming has a total of 18 delegates  (which obviously isn tthe sum of 7+7) and he was also likewise incoherent, all the way through.Maybe  the rules  in the Wyoming Democratic Party are like that; but, whatever they are, is so convoluted, America s news-media couldn t explain what they were, much less were they able to argue persuasively that this was somehow a democracy.The only thing that s clear is that the electoral system in the United States is so convoluted, so complex and so different from state to state and party to party, that whatever the intent of the writers of America s Constitution might have been, the system as it is today, can be successfully gamed and won only by interests who can afford to spend whatever billions of dollars are necessary in order to win. It s certainly anything but democratic.Right now, according to RealClear Politics, there are only two Presidential candidates who are shown repeatedly, and almost consistently, to be preferred by the majority of the U.S. electorate: the Democrat Bernie Sanders is strongly preferred over the Republicans Trump and Cruz, and he is barely preferred over the Republican Kasich; and the Republican Kasich is strongly preferred over the Democrat Clinton.  (Clinton loses strongly to Kasich and barely beats Cruz, while Trump is the weakest general-election candidate of all.)The strongest general-election candidates are, clearly, Sanders in the Democratic Party, and Kasich in the Republican Party. In a democracy, those would be the candidates. Throughout the contest thus far, neither of these two has been favored likely to win his respective Party s nomination, much less the Presidency.Whatever America is, it isn t a democracy   a one-person-one-vote majority-rule republic. In fact, the only scientific study that has ever been done of the U.S. political system, finds that it s no  democracy  at all, but instead an  oligarchy, a nation ruled by its aristocracy, its billionaires.It represents them, not the citizenry. That might not be the theory, but empirically it is the fact. An oligarchy is the commonest type of dictatorship, and it certainly is never a  benevolent dictatorship,  even if that phrase is not an oxymoron in itself.To sum up: the U.S. is ruled by and for the corrupters. It has been like that since at least 1980.***Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author, most recently, of  They re Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records, 1910-2010, and of  CHRIST S VENTRILOQUISTS: The Event that Created Christianity.READ MORE US ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",0
" Queen’s Brian May: We Don’t Want Our Music Used In Trump’s ‘Unsavory Campaign’ There have been many musical artists who have demanded that Donald Trump cease and desist using their tunes to rile up the crowds at his campaign rallies, and the lead guitarist for the iconic rock band Queen, Brian May, has just become the latest. May found out that Trump had used the Queen hit  We are the Champions  at an event, and immediately spoke out, saying to fans who made him aware of Trump s use of Queen s songs: I will make sure we take what steps we can to dissociate ourselves from Donald Trump s unsavoury campaign. He also says that as a matter of policy that Queen does not usually allow their music to be used by politicians, period, and wrote on his own personal website: This is not an official Queen statement, but I can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given. We are taking advice on what steps we can take to ensure this use does not continue. Regardless of our views on Mr Trump s platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool. Our music embodies our own dreams and beliefs, but it is for all who care to listen and enjoy. Just a little while ago, REM s music was used by Trump, and the response from former lead singer Michael Stipe was nothing short of delicious: Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you   you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign. In other words, rock stars don t want a damn thing to do with Donald Trump. He really better be careful, because he s going to wind up with even more lawsuits and legal trouble than he already has. Face it, Donald   the only musician who wants you using his music is Ted Nugent, and that s really not saying much at all. Keep it up, and you ll piss off all of Hollywood, and that is DEFINITELY not something you want to do.Featured image via Jordi Vidal/Getty Images",1
" WATCH: Patriot’s ‘Stand For Freedom’ Thwarted By Evil Socialist Ceiling Fan (VIDEO) One man s  stand for freedom  ended disastrously when he forgot to look up. YouTuber  Latherland  uploaded a clip on Thursday that shows a man attempting to make a patriotic, inspiring video that will convince the world to stand up to the tyrannical United States government. You know what?  the unidentified man says in front of a backdrop of a whirring ceiling fan.  It s about time our people took a stand for freedom. Inspiring. The gentleman emphasizes his point by standing up on his bed, but apparently forgets the fan buzzing above him. So you know what?  he says as he rises.  As a patriot, I m going to take a motherf*cking F*ck, sh*t,  Our hero yelled as he bravely smashed his head into something hard.  God damn it. F*ck.

"BREAKING: TWO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES Drop Out Of 2016 Presidential Race…Questions Linger Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie dropped out of the campaign for the Republican nomination for president today. The prospect of not making Saturday s GOP debate on CBS as a result of poor finishes in New Hampshire last night possibly triggered the pullout . The 2016 Presidential race is quickly dwindling down but questions linger regarding the two who dropped out today: Did Chris Christie miss his opportunity to have success at a run for president in 2012? He said at the time that he wasn t ready to run and then the Bridgegate scandal happened tarnishing his chances for a clean entrance into the 2016 campaign. If he had remained in the race, there s no doubt the scandal would have been a topic for discussion. One thing is for sure, Christie was able to damage Rubio in the last debate with his repeated claims that Rubio was spitting out canned sound bites he d memorized. Ouch! He also claimed that Rubio wasn t ready to be president.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie formally suspended his presidential campaign today.The New Jersey governor held a meeting with his campaign staff at 4pm this afternoon to thank them and announce the news, a spokesperson to the campaign confirms to ABC News.The decision comes a day after the New Jersey governor came in a disappointing 6th place in New Hampshire, despite a heavy investment of time and funds into the first-in-the-nation primary contest. We came to new Hampshire to bring the message,  Christie told gathered supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire as election results rolled in last night.  The message was heard by a lot of folks. And it was stood for by a lot of folks here in New Hampshire, just not enough.  Via: ABC Carly Fiorina Ends Her Bid For The Republican NominationWas Carly Fiorina s campaign for president harmed by ABC demoting her to the undercard debate stage? It s certainly a question that s been asked since the night of the debate. She really never recovered after that night.Carly Fiorina is exiting the Republican presidential race after a seventh-place showing in last night s New Hampshire primary. While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,  said Fiorina in a statement.Fiorina was an unconventional candidate. Her only previous political effort had been a 10-point loss in a race for U.S. Senate in California, and her tenure at Hewlett-Packard was most notable for her being fired by the board of directors after an unsuccessful merger with Compaq.Still, Fiorina struck a chord with many Republican voters, many of whom were especially drawn to her fierce anti-abortion viewpoints and spirited appearances on the campaign trail and in debates.

" Woman Gets Death Threats Just For Posting A Picture With Hillary Clinton After last week s election, Hillary supporters found a modicum of comfort in a photo, which quickly went viral. The photo was taken the day after the election. A woman named Margot Gerster, who was hiking through the woods in Upstate New York, ran into Hillary and Bill Clinton. Gerster snapped a photo of her and the Democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media. That s when the sh*t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats.The photo was simply of the two women and Gerster s baby. It in no way questioned or even referenced Donald Trump s election. Instead, it was a reassurance that life goes on, even after a crushing defeat.Within what seemed like hours, the conservative media attacks began. The chance encounter had to be fake, the argument went, because Gerster had met Hillary Clinton once before, many years ago. As if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met.Gerster admits she met Clinton when she was a teenager, but that had nothing to do with last Wednesday s chance encounter: It was so long ago,I do not remember. All I knew was that I was going to a nice dinner and Hillary Clinton was there,  she said.The mom dismissed accusations she s a long-time ally of the Clintons who secretly planned and engineered the heart-warming, post-election snap. If I were long-time friends of the Clintons, I wouldn t be keeping that a secret. I d be bragging about it to everyone I know,  Gerster said.Source: New York PostGerster insists, and Federal Election Commission records confirm, that she didn t even donate to Clinton.But, conservatives never let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory and Gerster says she s been getting death threats, although there s no record she s reported them to the cops. I don t want to discuss this anymore,  said Gerster, 30.  This story needs to go away. It got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of people, but I don t want this to add on to this (blowback), I don t want to fuel the fire. Who can blame her? Trump has clearly unleashed an ugly and violent underbelly in America. No one is safe.Featured image via Margot Gerster screen capture. ",1
" Friend Of Stanford Rapist: Not Everyone Who Rapes In College Is A Rapist Absolutely everything about the story of Brock Turner, the convicted Stanford swim team rapist, is gag-worthy. He received a particularly light sentence (more on that in a bit), his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just  20 minutes of action.  Now, a friend of Turner has spoken and her (yes her) attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well, he s in college, or something like that.Apparently, according to Turner s childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus: I don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists. Then, the obligatory victim blaming: This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement. No, this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far. This was a violent sexual assault. Here s just some of it, as retold by the victim:He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don t ask, can I finger you? Usually there s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that s why she wore the cardigan.Clearly, calling Turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness. It s simply a fact. Brock was convicted of three felony counts. While the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been 10 years, he will likely only serve three months. As horrendously unjust as that sentence is, it s still about three months longer than 97 percent of rapists serve. That s political incorrectness if I ve ever heard it.Featured image via video screen grab. ",1
"The U.S. Has No Legal Standing in Its Involvement in the War on Yemen  Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireYemen is proving what should be clear by now: President Trump may never make good on his bold campaign promise of less senseless wars overseas. Watch as Trump defers to the Generals to double-down on a bad Obama bet.This week, we learned that the US Department of Defense, led by General James Mattis, would like to increase its support for Saudi Arabia and its Gulf accomplices, in their effort to continue to further destabilize and bomb Yemen, followed by the installation by force of a US and Saudi-friendly regime in that country.Following over 2 years of hostilities against Yemen, Mattis has also decided to ask Congress for help in drafting some sort of authorization to give the US some legal standing in its continual involvement with this war. Mattis is erroneously bundling the issue of Yemen into both Syria and Iraq, claiming that this is somehow part of the  the fight against ISIS .What is it about Yemen that makes it such a gaping blind spot for members of the US government, its diplomatic corps and the US mainstream media?Fact: On its face, the joint Saudi-US War on Yemen is illegal under both US and International Law (see US legal analysis below).With that in mind, shouldn t every person in the US, from the Obama Administration forward and including the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, the CIA and so on, who has been involved in prosecuting this illegal, undeclared war of aggression   be indicted and charged with high crimes?Is the United States not a nation of laws, as so many politicians and pundits proudly proclaim to their public over the airwaves each and every day? Are we really a nation of laws?Or is Washington DC merely a nation of self-inflated, self-reverential hypocrites? In a nutshell the Saudis, Emiratis and the USA are inflicting a war of genocide against the Houthis,   (University of Illinois Professor of International Law, Francis Boyle)So what is the Trump Administration s solution to this collapsing situation? Of course, more sanctions. Because this war was initiated under President Obama, left-leaning and liberal media outlets and Democratic Party operators were bound to an unofficial regime of silence on the issue  of Yemen   hence, almost zero media coverage or commentary throughout 2015-2016. It was sufficient to focus only on Syria, and even then to streamline all mainstream media talking points with foreign policy directives from US State Department. With Syria, just look at the media coverage over the last 6 years and overlay it with the US State Department and British Foreign Office narratives. Totally seamless.For the US political right-wing and the Pentagon-oriented news outlets like CNN, the War on Yemen was simply reduced down to a binary argument, blaming the entire affair on Iran, claiming that the  Iranian-backed Houthis  were the primary antagonists. By framing it in the Iran-centric geopolitical context   and not the true context of US-Saudi aggression and a battle to control some of the regions most lucrative untapped oil and gas reserves   it served to somehow justify the organized, international crime which has been taking place. CNN s Wolf Blitzer was always careful to inject the correct qualifier (as he always does) of  Iranian-backed Houthis  when covering Yemen. By framing it as an Iranian plot, US neoconservatives also reinforced the operation as  good for Israel, which by extension means its in US national interest by virtue of the neoconservatives doctrine.Since the War on Yemen began in March 2015, rather than reporting on the carnage and pressuring the US government to recuse itself from its daily military role backing of Saudi Arabia, the mainstream media foreign policy gatekeepers and CFR members like CNN s Fareed Zakaria have instead opted to ignore the conflict as much as possible, opting instead to continue pushing more fake news and extravagant lies spun regarding Aleppo along with other aspects of the other illegal US operation arming international terrorists in Syria.Members of the media should be ashamed of themselves, but that assuming the word shame still exists in their lexicon. By now, it should be clear that they simply do not care. While the establishment and auxiliary CFR public relations mascots like George Clooney have been crusading for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to  take urgent action  against  the bad guys  in places like South Sudan (a CIA project from the onset) and fawning over the US-UK government joint project and pseudo-NGO fraud known as the White Helmets in Syria, the United States government and its partners Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and of the course the United Kingdom   have been allowed to get away with one of the most obvious and egregious, mass violations of international law and collective murder in modern history.In short, all the establishment and Deep State players; in Washington, the UNHRC (bought-off by Saudi Arabia), the mainstream media, Hollywood, and across the billion dollar think-tank industrial complex   have all colluded through their collective inaction and media censorship  in perpetrating an long-running and obvious international crime against humanity in Yemen. Add to this, holding in contempt the concept of the modern nation-state as it pertains to Yemen, by colluding in a violent, neocolonial fashion with the express intent to deny the Yemeni people their right to sovereignty. To compare Saudi Arabia s belligerent actions in Yemen to Nazi Germany s undeclared wars of aggression prior to WWII is no exaggeration. In fact, one could make the argument that this Saudi-US joint venture is much worse, and a far more dangerous precedent. Likewise, the failure of a corrupt UN (who effectively sold Saudi Arabia its seat as the head of the UN Human Rights Council ), led by an impotent Secretary General in Ban-ki Moon, to censure Saudi Arabia for its flagrant violation of international law, the Nuremberg Principles and the entire Geneva Convention content and implied framework   leaves the UN in the exact same position as the League of Nations in 1938. This is most certainly the case on paper, and with each passing moment we are nudging ever closer to geopolitical d j  vu. (Vanessa Beeley, 21WIRE, Oct 13, 2016)The following is a professional analysis, from a US legal perspective. The case is clear, and non-contestable under the current provision in both US and international law  Yemeni resident in Taiz, who lost everything after another Saudi airstrike.. Trevor Thrall & John Glaser ReasonAfter almost a year of bombings, Yemen is a humanitarian catastrophe. Over 6,000 Yemenis have been killed [an extremely conservative estimate]  half of them civilians. According to a recent United Nations report, the Saudi-led coalition has  conducted airstrikes targeting civilians and civilian objects,  including refugee camps, hospitals, weddings, and mosques. Saudi bombing has reduced large tracts of several cities to rubble. Some of the attacks, according to the U.N. panel, could amount to crimes against humanity.As of this month, over two million people in Yemen are internally displaced, millions lack access to potable water, and thanks to a U.S.-supported Saudi blockade on imports, more than 14 million Yemenis are at risk of starvation.Throughout, the U.S. has quietly but dutifully lent the Saudis weapons, logistics assistance, and diplomatic cover. It s time to stop.The civil conflict in Yemen has its roots in the overthrow in 2011 of long-time U.S.-Saudi ally Ali Abdullah Saleh. In the midst of the unrest, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. supported a political transition to a government headed by President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in which he was the only candidate on the ballot. Yemen s Shiite Houthi rebels waged an insurgency against the Hadi government and captured the capital city Sanaa in 2014.The civil war then morphed into an intractable proxy war when, in March of last year, Saudi Arabia decided to wage a vicious bombing campaign under the pretext of destroying the Houthi rebellion and reinstating Hadi s beleaguered government. Riyadh views the Houthis as a proxy of Iran, and after the peaceful diplomatic settlement between the U.S. and Iran over the latter s nuclear program, U.S. officials have apparently felt obliged to reassure Saudi Arabia by supporting its war in Yemen.The problem is that Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen compromises both U.S. interests and its moral standing. Our interests are harmed because undermining the Houthis and contributing to the power vacuum in the country has benefitted the position of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which happens to share Saudi distaste for the Houthis.The Saudis succeed in garnering U.S. support in part by characterizing the war as a fight against terrorism. But the Saudis and al-Qaeda are actually in an awkward alliance in this fight, making U.S. help even more misguided.As for our moral standing, by supporting Saudi Arabia s military action, we are a party to serious war crimes and are indirectly at fault for the devastating humanitarian crisis the people of Yemen now face.The Saudi intervention clearly violates the just war tenet of jus ad bellum. That tenet dictates that nations not only have a just cause for going to war but also resort to military force only after all other options have been exhausted. Despite Saudi claims to the contrary, the intervention is clearly not a case of self-defense. The notion that Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East (kept afloat primarily by Saudi funds), represents a military threat to Saudi Arabia is absurd. And to argue Saudi bombs are justified to prevent future terrorist attacks is to argue for preventive war, which violates just war theory and the UN Charter.The Saudis insist that their actions are legal because the legitimate Yemeni government invited military intervention. But the Hadi government hardly deserves the label legitimate. Hadi was elevated to the presidency after serving in Saleh s autocratic regime as vice president. Once president, Hadi used his position to consolidate power against the Houthis and Saleh loyalists all while misappropriating billions of dollars. A better description would be to call the Hadi government a tool of Saudi Arabia, since Saudi Arabia not only brokered the deal that allowed him to replace Saleh but also enabled him to return to Yemen after the Houthis drove him from the country. Arguing that the Saudis are responding to a call for help is essentially to argue that the Saudis asked themselves to intervene in Yemen.So, if Saudi Arabia s argument for intervention is weak, what s the U.S. s excuse? Any claim that this is a part and parcel of the war on terror is dubious, considering the bombing of Yemen is, if anything, bolstering Islamic extremists. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia itself is a major exporter of the kind of jihadist ideology that drives groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.Even if it were about countering terrorist groups, if the threat to Saudi Arabia from Yemen is remote, the threat to the United States is certainly too small to justify violating the rules of war, international moral norms, and common decency.Beyond placating overexcited Saudi fears of a U.S. strategic tilt towards Iran, there simply is no moral, legal, or strategic justification for what the U.S. is doing in Yemen.About the Authors: Trevor Thrall is an associate professor at the School of Policy, Government, and International Affairs at George Mason University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.

"Georgia Teachers Fired for Pro-Trump Comments The DeKalb County Georgia School Superintendent, Stephen Green, has issued a warning to all teachers against making statements in support of President Donald Trump or his policies.  Since the warning was given, two teachers have already been forced to tender their resignation.Via World Net Daily: Green is now taking it a step further, warning teachers not to inject their personal beliefs into the classroom if they line up with those of the president of the United States.Green told a local newspaper, the Champion, that his Jan. 30 statement sought to grant students assurance that DeKalb County Schools officials remain committed to being  culturally responsive, diverse and supportive  of DeKalb County s immigrant population. Our schools will be safe places for learning and teaching,  he wrote in the statement.  We will not tolerate any form of bullying or discrimination on or off district property that interferes with learning or the rights of others. Apparently teaching jobs in some Georgia public schools now include furthering the superintendent s personal political views.(Source: The Gateway Pundit)",1

"BREAKING…Internal Memo From OBAMA’S Corrupt EPA: FLINT NOT WORTH “Going Out On A Limb For” Wow! Bernie and Hillary have been making hay over the Flint water crisis for months now, using the crisis to secure votes from the black community.  Leftists have been converging on the city like rats in search of the last peice of cheese on earth and now we have proof that Obama s EPA knew about the crisis, but didn t think the people of Flint were worthy of protecting.An internal Environmental Protection Agency memo showed officials didn t think  Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for  while residents of the Michigan town drank lead-contaminated water.House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz presented an internal memo between the EPA official who oversees Michigan, a branch manager in the EPA s Region 5, the associate director of the water division for Region 5 and an EPA environmental engineer about the water crisis in Flint.In the memo, one of the officials   it wasn t clear who based on the screen shown by Chaffetz   said Flint wasn t worth helping. Perhaps she already knows all this, but I m not so sure Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for,  the memo stated.Chaffetz was incredulous at the memo. Are you kidding me?  he said, looking at Susan Hedman, the former director of EPA s Region 5, which oversees much of the Midwest including Michigan. Why isn t Flint the community they go to? Of all the communities, the community having trouble is the one you go all out for,  Chaffetz said.  Via: Washington Examiner",0
" Trump Has Planted Spies To Ensure His Cabinet’s Loyalty – What He’s Calling Them Is TERRIFYING It s hard not to wonder just how paranoid and/or dictatorial Trump really is. One would think that, since he s the one appointing his cabinet, that he d be able to trust those secretaries to do their jobs according to how he wants them done. Apparently, though, that s not the case. Trump is so ridiculous that he s appointed many White House aides whose jobs are specifically to spy on the cabinet secretaries.All of these people have the title of  senior White House adviser,  and their offices are very close to their secretaries  offices. The point literally seems to be ensuring the cabinet secretaries  loyalty to Trump, seeing as how they report to the Office of Cabinet Affairs and not to the secretaries.But that s not all. That would be bad enough, but the White House has names for some of them that aren t  senior White House adviser.  For instance, the officer who s spying on General Mattis over at the Department of Defense is literally called  the commissar.  That s a reference to Soviet-era Communist Party officials whose task was just to ensure their commanders  loyalty.These people are embedded in every agency from the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services to the EPA, even to NASA. They are in constant contact with the White House.Obama, Bush and Clinton did not use this kind of spy method to ensure their cabinets did exactly as they were told.And that s nuts. But one former Trump adviser actually thinks this is smart, which just illustrates the level of paranoia and authoritarianism that has existed inside Trump s circles even before he was elected: Especially when you re starting a government and you have a changeover of parties when policies are going to be dramatically different, I think it s something that s smart. Somebody needs to be there as the White House s man on the scene. Because there s no senior staff yet, they re functioning as the White House s voice and ears in these departments. We guess the secretaries themselves just aren t good enough.The funny thing is that the Trump administration is all up in arms about  the deep state,  and the alleged  shadow government  that Obama s supposedly running to oppose Trump. Yet, they re creating their own shadow government with these  advisers  who are supposed to spy on leaders to make sure they remain properly loyal.If Trump can t trust even his own appointees to be loyal without spies like this, then he has no business running the U.S. government. But we already knew that, and this is just the latest thing to prove that Trump is trying to position himself as Supreme Overlord of the United States, or something.Featured image by Andrea Morales via Getty Images",1
" Trump Explodes At Smiling Protester: ‘I’d Like To Punch Him In The Face’ (VIDEO) A few weeks ago, Rachel Maddow did a comparison of Donald Trump and notorious racist George Wallace on her show. One of the points she made about the 2016 candidate and the 1968 candidate is how violent they both are. Like George Wallace, Trump is able to get his crowds riled up into such a frenzy that they start attacking protesters. At the beginning of his campaign, The Donald would do it by screeching  GET HIM OUTTA HERE,  but during a recent event, he actually said he d like to punch a protester in the face.During a campaign event in Nevada on Monday night, Trump flipped out after he was interrupted by some hecklers and said: You know what I hate? There s a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches   we re not allowed to punch back anymore. In the old days, you know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this? They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Yeah, that imbecile thinks that protesting at one of his events warrants being  carried out on a stretcher.  But he wasn t finished. When one of the protesters was removed by security, the man was smiling and this really pissed Trump off, he said, I d like to punch him in the face, I ll tell you that. There s a guy throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming and everything else when we re talking, and we re talking out   we re not allowed, the guards are very gentle with him, he s walking, like, big high fives, smiling, laughing   I d like to punch him in the face. According to Politico security admitted that nobody was  throwing punches.  Instead, it looks like Trump made that up to justify his violent words. This is, of course, not surprising coming from a man who once applauded his supporters for kicking and punching a Black Lives Matter protester. It is, however, frightening that this man is in first place in the GOP polls. A man who stands on a stage and incites violence. A man who that is how a president should behave. This is what the Republican Party is offering up to the country: a schoolyard bully. Seriously? And they wonder why their party is slowly dying Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",0
" Modern Medicine Explains Why Your Desire To Punch Ted Cruz In The Face Is Completely Natural Germans call it Backpfeifengesicht. It s a colloquialism which translated means  a face that needs to be hit.  However, you don t need to be German to want to punch Ted Cruz in the face. While there hasn t been any formal polling on the question, I personally would feel safe wagering money on it being over 50 percent of America. But what does this all mean? Are we a nation of unreasonable bullies for wanting this?Doctor Richard Cytowic has taken some time to explain to America why they are not a nation of bad people for their burning desire to smash a knuckle sandwich into Ted Cruz s jaw. It turns out this is all a very natural and very scientific thing we are experiencing.While I would never actually suggest someone would do something like punch Ted Cruz in the face (I m not suggesting they don t either), the feeling that you want to means you are operating at a normal mental state   so just enjoy the feeling and embrace it within reason.Dr. Cytowic explained that humans learn to read facial expressions from the day they are born. It s one of our most rudimentary and instinctual means of communication. Our brains have had a million years of practice at reading facial expressions, generating an instant like or dislike of the person that they are attached to. To put it more simply, it s an evolutionary survival trait to determine friend from foe, and our brains are extremely good at it by now.With this in mind, it explains a lot about why practically everyone hates Ted Cruz. It isn t just his policy. There are oodles of idiot Republicans we could hate for that same reason. Ted brings out a more visceral and emotional reaction, unlike most others. Even among his fellow Republicans nobody likes him, and that says a lot.Dr. Cytowic goes on to describe how Cruz s facial expressions do not shift the way normal Human expression does. He has rarely observed a normal smile from Ted Cruz. In a normal smile the corners of the mouth go up, and the muscles circling the eyes contract making them narrow and forming crow s feet at the outside corners. When it comes to Ted, his mouth just tightens into a straight line, and on the rare occasion that it deviates from this, the corners bend downward.  The outside of his eyes bend downward as well, which is completely opposite of what is normal, as the eyebrows typically bend upwards.To put it simply, Ted Cruz has a look of disgust on his face that only gets worse when he tries to look happy and smile. It s like he is some kind of anti-politician, because you would think that someone who has his kind of fan base would naturally be able to express themselves more pleasantly. So remember, when you see Ted on TV and you want to throw something at the screen, it means you re ok because it s only natural.Featured image from Twitter ",1

"WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO] That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking home through his affluent Washington DC neighborhood. He was beaten and shot in the back, but apparently nothing of any value was taken from his body, which would likely mean robbery was not a motive. If robbery wasn t a motive and the police still have no clues what exactly was the motive for his brutal murder? In our previous article, we explored the possibility that he may have been about to blow the whistle on voter fraud. Does anyone have an actual tally of the number of people who had ties to the Clintons that ended up dead? Now Bernie Sanders supporter and activist Shawn Lucas is found dead.On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.According to Snopes Lucas was found dead on his bathroom floor.We contacted Lucas  employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas  death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas  cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone. Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.Watch here:And on June 22, 2016, former UN official John Ashe  accidentally  crushed his own throat and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons and Democrat Party.Via: Gateway Pundit",0

" Twitter Goes Ballistic After Trump’s Penis Joke: ‘Some Things You Just Can’t Fact-Check’ (TWEETS) Last night, the Republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size.This happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh GOP debate, when Trump addressed rival Marco Rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring America that there was  no problem with the size of his junk. No one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature, petty discussion   but you can always count on Trump to help the country sink to new lows.While many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state, wallowing over the fact that a nationally-televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke, Twitter swooped in to save the day. As soon as Trump made his ill-timed joke, Twitter was flooded with the most clever, hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much-needed perspective to keep us afloat as Trump continues to dominate the Republican polls.Here are some of the most amazing responses to Trump, to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the GOP debate might actually win the nomination:TwitterTwitterMany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment.TwitterThe New York Post and Huffington Post didn t disappoint:Twitter TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterLast night s GOP debate was less about policy and the future of America than it was about Trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle.

Even though a number of his children have spoken out and said that Reagan would be appalled by the comparisons.While these candidates, like Ted Cruz and (shudder) Donald Trump, name drop the former president during every GOP debate, they behave like schoolyard bullies and pledge to never compromise with Democrats. Reagan may have had faults (A LOT of them) but he knew how to compromise and he never, ever behaved the way the current Republican Party does.As a matter of fact, if Ronald Reagan was a candidate in this race, the others running would probably call him a RINO and a traitor. And they damn sure wouldn t support any amnesty plan for undocumented immigrants (like the one he is well-known for).The current GOP is so gross that when news of Nancy s passing spread, their voters took it as on opportunity to attack the current first lady, Michelle Obama.With all of this, is it really any wonder she was upset?Watch:https://youtu.be/TZUVIbWbT2w Featured image via video screenshot",1
"SHRILLARY GIVES BITTER CONCESSION SPEECH In New Hampshire Will the Democrats ultimately choose a Marxist who s never accomplished a thing in his life or a serial criminal socialist? Choices choices MANCHESTER, N.H.   Hillary Clinton spoke of being  knocked down  and having problems with young voters in a bitter concession speech after losing to Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. I don t know what we d have done tonight if we d actually won. This is pretty exciting,  Clinton said to her crowd of supporters shortly after 9 PM Eastern Time, flanked onstage by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, who did not speak.  I just want to say, I still love New Hampshire and I always will. People are angry. But there s also hungry. They re hungry for solutions. What are we going to do?,  Clinton said. I know I have some work to do, especially with young people,  Clinton said.  Even if they are not supporting me right now, I am supporting them It s not whether you get knocked down that matters, it s whether you get back up. Clinton devolved into an angry, ranting style by speech s end, calling for  human rights  for gays, women, workers, and others. She also pivoted to focus on South Carolina, which will be decided by the black vote, talking about how African-American parents should not have to worry about their kids being  harassed  or  shot,  and immigrant families should not have to  lie awake at night waiting for a knock on the door  signaling deportation.She also spoke of the contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan and of a hypothetical  grandmother  forced to choose between rent or food because some drug company raised medicine prices by 4,000 percent   an apparent reference to scandal-ridden former drug CEO Martin Shkreli.Clinton lost resoundingly to Sanders in the Granite State. By the time she finished her speech, Sanders was beating her 58.5 percent to 39.7 percent with 37 percent of the precincts reporting. CNN called the race for Sanders at approximately 8 PM.Sanders  win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.Forty-one percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats, according to CNN exit polling.

" House Republicans Pave Way For Rampant Corruption Under Trump By Gutting Independent Ethics Panel House Republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during Donald Trump s reign in the White House.On Monday night, Republicans voted 119-74 to cripple the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of Congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked Capitol Hill. Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",0

"JPMORGAN CEO Blows Up at the DC Dysfunction: Tired of Listening to the ‘Stupid Sh*t’ [Video] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC",1
"Trump’s First Congressional Speech Stuns Media Detractors – Stock Markets Rally 21st Century Wire says Last night, an embattled President Donald Trump gave his first address to Congress. The results surprised even his fiercest critics. He became president of the United States in that moment, period,  said Trump critic and CNN commentator Van Jones.  That was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period. Make no mistake, it was a house divided, but it seems that the White House achieved its chief objective   to stop the public relations hemorrhaging, for now at least.One unusual aspect of this Trump speech   reports suggest that the President actually spent the day of his first address to a joint session of Congress revising and rehearsing his speech.It seemed to have paid off.

"NEW BIOGRAPHY Exposes Barack Obama’s Dream Of Becoming Donald Trump Barack Obama s white college girlfriend Sheila Miyoshi Jager, who is now a professor at Oberlin College, tells a story of a very calculating man who was not about to let her race get in the way of his political ambitions: In the winter of  86, when we visited my parents, he asked me to marry him,  she told Garrow. Her parents were opposed, less for any racial reasons (Barack came across to them like  a white, middle-class kid,  a close family friend said) than for concern about Obama s professional prospects, and because her mother thought Sheila, two years Obama s junior, was too young.  Not yet,  Sheila told Barack. But they stayed together.In early 1987, when Obama was 25, she sensed a change.  He became. . . so very ambitious  very suddenly,  she told Garrow.  I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president. Discussions of race and politics suddenly overwhelmed Sheila and Barack s relationship.  The marriage discussions dragged on and on,  but now they were clouded by Obama s  torment over this central issue of his life . . . race and identity,  Sheila recalls. The  resolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,  she said.At Harvard, the Obama the world has come to know took clearer form. In his late 20s now and slightly older than most classmates, he had a compulsion to orate in class and summarize other people s arguments for them.  In law school the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up,  one student told Garrow. Classmates created a Obamanometer, ranking  how pretentious someone s remarks are in class. If Garrow is indeed correct in concluding that Obama s romantic choices were influenced by his political ambitions, it is no small irony that Michelle Obama became one of those most skeptical about Obama s political prospects, and most dubious about his will to rise. She constantly discourages his efforts toward elective office and resents the time he spends away from her and their two young daughters. Obama vented to a friend how often Michelle would talk about money.  Why don t you go out and get a good job? You re a lawyer   you can make all the money we need,  she would tell him, as the couple struggled with student loans and the demands of family and political life. (Garrow sides with Michelle, highlighting how, on the day after Sasha was born, Barack went downtown for a meeting.)As he considered a U.S. Senate bid, Obama s team commissioned a poll that covered, among other questions, his name.  Barry,  as he was known from childhood into his early college years, polled better than  Barack,  but Obama never considered resurrecting the old name. He had made his choice, of identity and image, long ago. Sheila recalls that one of the few times Obama became genuinely angry with her was in Hawaii, when she heard relatives calling him Barry, and she did so as well, just for fun. He became  irrationally furious,  she said.  He told me that under no circumstances was I ever to use that name with him. There was no going back.The sense of destiny is not unusual among those who become president. (See Clinton, Bill.) But it created complications. Obama believed that he had a  calling,  Garrow writes, and in his case it was  coupled with a heightened awareness that to pursue it he had to fully identify as African American. Obama had considered Donald Trump long before either man won the presidency, and brushed off his existence as a misguided national fantasy. Americans have a  continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility,  Obama wrote in the old Harvard book manuscript, now more than 25 years old.  The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American   I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don t make it, my children will.

" Republicans In Congress Want To Give Donald Trump Unrestricted War Powers If Donald Trump becomes president, you better prepare for World War III, because if Republicans have their way, their presumptive nominee will have unprecedented power to wage war across the globe without restrictions from Congress.Throughout his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump has bragged that he  wants to have a much stronger military  so strong that nobody is going to mess with us.  Of course, that means increased military spending that is completely unnecessary because we already have the top military in the world and we spend more on our military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, England, India, and Germany combined. In fact, we could slash our military spending in half and would still spend more than any other nation.Graph courtesy of Peter G. Peterson FoundationBut Republicans are gunning to keep military spending at monstrous levels and they are willing to give Trump unprecedented and unlimited war power.Earlier this year, Senate Republicans introduced a new Authorization for Use of Military Force that would authorize presidents to wage war anywhere anytime without having to ask Congress for a declaration of war as the Constitution requires.According to Huffington Post:[The AUMF] would give the president new authority to take action against the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. It wouldn t put any limits on the duration, geography or use of U.S. ground combat troops in the war, or on the means by which the U.S. military could act. It also would keep in place a broad AUMF from 2001 that never expired and that allows the president to take military action against anyone, anywhere, connected to the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks.In other words, Donald Trump would have complete power to go to war whenever he wants against whomever he wants and Republican lawmakers are just fine with that because they don t want the responsibility of making war decisions. I don t like the idea of telling a commander-in-chief they can t go where ISIL goes, they re limited by time, geography and means,  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said.  If I don t like the time, geography or means, I can cut off funding. Alabama GOP Rep. Mike Rogers thinks Donald Trump would  be an improvement  over President Obama, who has used diplomacy effectively in his foreign policy agenda while limiting his own war strategy to air strikes and predator drone strikes rather than sending thousands of American troops to war.South Carolina GOP Rep. Joe Wilson thinks  we need to finish what we started,  and he is totally okay with Donald Trump controlling the military because he suggested Trump will also try to work with the terrorists, too.Senator Chuck Grassley said he would comfortable with Trump as long as he  has a plan,  and Arizona GOP Rep. Trent Franks wants Trump to  advocate the maintenance and strength of a military capable of dealing with the growing threats to freedom this world faces  and  dismiss the practice of Mr. Obama of emboldening our enemies and disheartening our friends. That s basically code meaning that Trump should rip up the nuclear deal with Iran to reduce their nuclear material and attack them instead even though the deal is working.Trump has already declared his disapproval of the deal. He also said in 2011 that America should use  any and all means necessary  to stop Iran s nuclear program, which includes military force.Republicans are already itching for a war against Iran. A President Trump could give them one unilaterally.Trump has also suggested in his book The America We Deserve that he would use force against North Korea, which would guarantee a new Korean War.[In a Trump presidency], North Korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice. I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Ghadhafi in 1986. I don t think anybody is going to accuse me of tiptoeing through the issues or tap-dancing around them either. Who else in public life has called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea?Trump has also not been secretive about the fact that he wants to bring back the use of torture and commit war crimes against civilian populations in the effort to defeat terrorists.That s scary enough, but consider this.As president, Donald Trump would also have control over the nation s nuclear arsenal. And he has already refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and the Middle East.In short, a President Trump could usher in a nuclear Armageddon and Congress has absolutely no problem with this.If Trump somehow defeats Hillary Clinton in November and Republicans retain control of the Senate and the House, we could see World War III as the thin-skinned businessman in the White House responds to the smallest of slights or Republican prodding with military strikes that could spill the blood of thousands of American soldiers and put the country further into debt.That is what is at stake in this election so let s hope people start taking this seriously.Featured image via Flickr ",1
" SHAME: Proof Trump Doesn’t Care About Military Veterans Donald Trump has often invoked the U.S. military and treatment of military veterans while he has campaigned as the Republican presidential nominee. But time and time again, when it comes to actions and deeds, Trump s behavior is that of someone who doesn t really care at all.The latest evidence of that comes from reporting on how he behaved while attacking the family of Captain Humayun Khan, the soldier who died protecting his unit in Iraq in 2004. Trump responded to the Khan family s speech during the Democratic Convention by attacking the family, but now we are learning just how ignorant Trump was while he was involved in this smear.New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported on Saturday that when one adviser warned Trump he had just attacked a Gold Star family, the GOP nominee responded  what s that?  The term is commonly used to refer to any family that has lost a loved one in war. The United States has officially recognized these families since 1936.[ ]Sherman also reported that Paul Manafort, who was then Trump s campaign chairman, had to explain what  Gold Star family  meant.Reporting has shown that with Trump, the Republicans have nominated an extreme narcisst, who doesn t understand any more of the wider world than he has to contend with on a day-to-day basis. Trump neither cares nor does he have the curiosity to care, even if the welfare of soldiers is the issue.His staff has been reduced to being a series of sitters for a wealthy baby.Captain Khan s father, Khizr Khan, is still involved in the 2016 election. Within the last week, Mr. Khan was on the campaign trail speaking about and advocating on behalf of the candidate he believes in and who he trusts to defend Muslims, soldiers, and Muslim soldiers: Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Flickr",0
"BREAKING: FLINT’S DEMOCRAT MAYOR SUED After Whistleblower Rats Her Out For STEALING DONATIONS Meant For Residents Democrats looking for attention and along with every celebrity who has been able to find their way to the burned out city of Flint, MI have all jumped on the  It s all Michigan s Republican Governor Snyder s fault  bandwagon. In reality, there has been plenty of blame to go around. Obama s EPA Director, Gina McCarthy has plenty of culpability when it comes to the involvement of her EPA officials and the cover up of the Flint water crisis. In the end however, it s never about the people of Flint, it s about saving the hides of the inept political officials who allowed this crisis to happen. Flint Lives really don t Matter to greedy politicians like Hillary Clinton, who have used the horrible misfortune of Flint residents to gain trust and votes in the black community.Will anyone remember Hillary s support for black Democrat Mayor Karen Weaver, who is now being accused of STEALING money from charitable donations (that should have been used to support the people who are suffering in the community where she was elected) and putting it into her own campaign fund?The Flint water crisis has triggered yet another lawsuit, this one filed by the city s former administrator, who claims she was wrongfully fired for blowing the whistle on the mayor of Flint for allegedly trying to steer money from a charity for local families into a campaign fund.Former City Administrator Natasha Henderson, 39, who now lives in Muskegon, claims in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court that she was terminated on Feb. 12 for seeking an investigation into allegations of misconduct by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver.Specifically, the suit alleges that Weaver directed a city employee and volunteer to steer donors away from a charity called Safe Water/Safe Homes, and instead give money to the so-called  Karenabout Flint  fund, which was a political action committee or campaign fund created at Weaver s direction.According to the lawsuit, a city employee told Henderson in confidence that she and a volunteer had previously been directing donors to the City of Flint s website, where they could give money to the Safe Water/Safe Homes charity, which helped families affected by the water crisis. But Weaver directed them to steer donors to the  Karenabout Flint  website, which the city council had not approved, the suit claims. A red flag went off when it was an unrecognizable fund,  Henderson s lawyer, Katherine Smith Kennedy, told the Free Press.  She did the right thing. She reported the matter to the city attorney. And for doing the right thing, she was punished. She was fired. The lawsuit names the City of Flint and Weaver as defendants.For entire story: Detroit Free Press",1

"The U.S. Has No Legal Standing in Its Involvement in the War on Yemen  Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireYemen is proving what should be clear by now: President Trump may never make good on his bold campaign promise of less senseless wars overseas. Watch as Trump defers to the Generals to double-down on a bad Obama bet.This week, we learned that the US Department of Defense, led by General James Mattis, would like to increase its support for Saudi Arabia and its Gulf accomplices, in their effort to continue to further destabilize and bomb Yemen, followed by the installation by force of a US and Saudi-friendly regime in that country.Following over 2 years of hostilities against Yemen, Mattis has also decided to ask Congress for help in drafting some sort of authorization to give the US some legal standing in its continual involvement with this war. Mattis is erroneously bundling the issue of Yemen into both Syria and Iraq, claiming that this is somehow part of the  the fight against ISIS .What is it about Yemen that makes it such a gaping blind spot for members of the US government, its diplomatic corps and the US mainstream media?Fact: On its face, the joint Saudi-US War on Yemen is illegal under both US and International Law (see US legal analysis below).With that in mind, shouldn t every person in the US, from the Obama Administration forward and including the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, the CIA and so on, who has been involved in prosecuting this illegal, undeclared war of aggression   be indicted and charged with high crimes?Is the United States not a nation of laws, as so many politicians and pundits proudly proclaim to their public over the airwaves each and every day? Are we really a nation of laws?Or is Washington DC merely a nation of self-inflated, self-reverential hypocrites? In a nutshell the Saudis, Emiratis and the USA are inflicting a war of genocide against the Houthis,   (University of Illinois Professor of International Law, Francis Boyle)So what is the Trump Administration s solution to this collapsing situation? Of course, more sanctions. Because this war was initiated under President Obama, left-leaning and liberal media outlets and Democratic Party operators were bound to an unofficial regime of silence on the issue  of Yemen   hence, almost zero media coverage or commentary throughout 2015-2016. It was sufficient to focus only on Syria, and even then to streamline all mainstream media talking points with foreign policy directives from US State Department. With Syria, just look at the media coverage over the last 6 years and overlay it with the US State Department and British Foreign Office narratives. Totally seamless.For the US political right-wing and the Pentagon-oriented news outlets like CNN, the War on Yemen was simply reduced down to a binary argument, blaming the entire affair on Iran, claiming that the  Iranian-backed Houthis  were the primary antagonists. By framing it in the Iran-centric geopolitical context   and not the true context of US-Saudi aggression and a battle to control some of the regions most lucrative untapped oil and gas reserves   it served to somehow justify the organized, international crime which has been taking place. CNN s Wolf Blitzer was always careful to inject the correct qualifier (as he always does) of  Iranian-backed Houthis  when covering Yemen. By framing it as an Iranian plot, US neoconservatives also reinforced the operation as  good for Israel, which by extension means its in US national interest by virtue of the neoconservatives doctrine.Since the War on Yemen began in March 2015, rather than reporting on the carnage and pressuring the US government to recuse itself from its daily military role backing of Saudi Arabia, the mainstream media foreign policy gatekeepers and CFR members like CNN s Fareed Zakaria have instead opted to ignore the conflict as much as possible, opting instead to continue pushing more fake news and extravagant lies spun regarding Aleppo along with other aspects of the other illegal US operation arming international terrorists in Syria.Members of the media should be ashamed of themselves, but that assuming the word shame still exists in their lexicon. By now, it should be clear that they simply do not care. While the establishment and auxiliary CFR public relations mascots like George Clooney have been crusading for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to  take urgent action  against  the bad guys  in places like South Sudan (a CIA project from the onset) and fawning over the US-UK government joint project and pseudo-NGO fraud known as the White Helmets in Syria, the United States government and its partners Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and of the course the United Kingdom   have been allowed to get away with one of the most obvious and egregious, mass violations of international law and collective murder in modern history.In short, all the establishment and Deep State players; in Washington, the UNHRC (bought-off by Saudi Arabia), the mainstream media, Hollywood, and across the billion dollar think-tank industrial complex   have all colluded through their collective inaction and media censorship  in perpetrating an long-running and obvious international crime against humanity in Yemen. Add to this, holding in contempt the concept of the modern nation-state as it pertains to Yemen, by colluding in a violent, neocolonial fashion with the express intent to deny the Yemeni people their right to sovereignty. To compare Saudi Arabia s belligerent actions in Yemen to Nazi Germany s undeclared wars of aggression prior to WWII is no exaggeration. In fact, one could make the argument that this Saudi-US joint venture is much worse, and a far more dangerous precedent. Likewise, the failure of a corrupt UN (who effectively sold Saudi Arabia its seat as the head of the UN Human Rights Council ), led by an impotent Secretary General in Ban-ki Moon, to censure Saudi Arabia for its flagrant violation of international law, the Nuremberg Principles and the entire Geneva Convention content and implied framework   leaves the UN in the exact same position as the League of Nations in 1938. This is most certainly the case on paper, and with each passing moment we are nudging ever closer to geopolitical d j  vu.

According to a recent United Nations report, the Saudi-led coalition has  conducted airstrikes targeting civilians and civilian objects,  including refugee camps, hospitals, weddings, and mosques. Saudi bombing has reduced large tracts of several cities to rubble. Some of the attacks, according to the U.N. panel, could amount to crimes against humanity.As of this month, over two million people in Yemen are internally displaced, millions lack access to potable water, and thanks to a U.S.-supported Saudi blockade on imports, more than 14 million Yemenis are at risk of starvation.Throughout, the U.S. has quietly but dutifully lent the Saudis weapons, logistics assistance, and diplomatic cover. It s time to stop.The civil conflict in Yemen has its roots in the overthrow in 2011 of long-time U.S.-Saudi ally Ali Abdullah Saleh. In the midst of the unrest, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. supported a political transition to a government headed by President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in which he was the only candidate on the ballot. Yemen s Shiite Houthi rebels waged an insurgency against the Hadi government and captured the capital city Sanaa in 2014.The civil war then morphed into an intractable proxy war when, in March of last year, Saudi Arabia decided to wage a vicious bombing campaign under the pretext of destroying the Houthi rebellion and reinstating Hadi s beleaguered government. Riyadh views the Houthis as a proxy of Iran, and after the peaceful diplomatic settlement between the U.S. and Iran over the latter s nuclear program, U.S. officials have apparently felt obliged to reassure Saudi Arabia by supporting its war in Yemen.The problem is that Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen compromises both U.S. interests and its moral standing. Our interests are harmed because undermining the Houthis and contributing to the power vacuum in the country has benefitted the position of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which happens to share Saudi distaste for the Houthis.The Saudis succeed in garnering U.S. support in part by characterizing the war as a fight against terrorism. But the Saudis and al-Qaeda are actually in an awkward alliance in this fight, making U.S. help even more misguided.As for our moral standing, by supporting Saudi Arabia s military action, we are a party to serious war crimes and are indirectly at fault for the devastating humanitarian crisis the people of Yemen now face.The Saudi intervention clearly violates the just war tenet of jus ad bellum. That tenet dictates that nations not only have a just cause for going to war but also resort to military force only after all other options have been exhausted. Despite Saudi claims to the contrary, the intervention is clearly not a case of self-defense. The notion that Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East (kept afloat primarily by Saudi funds), represents a military threat to Saudi Arabia is absurd. And to argue Saudi bombs are justified to prevent future terrorist attacks is to argue for preventive war, which violates just war theory and the UN Charter.The Saudis insist that their actions are legal because the legitimate Yemeni government invited military intervention. But the Hadi government hardly deserves the label legitimate. Hadi was elevated to the presidency after serving in Saleh s autocratic regime as vice president. Once president, Hadi used his position to consolidate power against the Houthis and Saleh loyalists all while misappropriating billions of dollars. A better description would be to call the Hadi government a tool of Saudi Arabia, since Saudi Arabia not only brokered the deal that allowed him to replace Saleh but also enabled him to return to Yemen after the Houthis drove him from the country. Arguing that the Saudis are responding to a call for help is essentially to argue that the Saudis asked themselves to intervene in Yemen.So, if Saudi Arabia s argument for intervention is weak, what s the U.S. s excuse? Any claim that this is a part and parcel of the war on terror is dubious, considering the bombing of Yemen is, if anything, bolstering Islamic extremists. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia itself is a major exporter of the kind of jihadist ideology that drives groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.Even if it were about countering terrorist groups, if the threat to Saudi Arabia from Yemen is remote, the threat to the United States is certainly too small to justify violating the rules of war, international moral norms, and common decency.Beyond placating overexcited Saudi fears of a U.S. strategic tilt towards Iran, there simply is no moral, legal, or strategic justification for what the U.S. is doing in Yemen.About the Authors: Trevor Thrall is an associate professor at the School of Policy, Government, and International Affairs at George Mason University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.

" Conservative Convicted Of Trying To Assassinate Obama With A Slingshot — Yes, A Slingshot (SCREENSHOTS) A Wisconsin man who believed it to be his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY  to kill the President was convicted last week of two counts of threatening Barack Obama. After four hours of deliberations, a jury of seven men and five women found 55-year-old Brian Dennis Dutcher guilty of writing a Facebook comment about assassinating the President upon learning of an upcoming visit, and of telling a security guard he would shoot Obama the day before POTUS  arrival in Tomah.In comments under a Facebook post in which he informed people that  all members of the fed gov have targets on their foreheads,  and that they should be shot on sight, Dutcher gleefully remarked that  the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip.  Dutcher explained that he planned to kill the President so his daughter can  live free. That s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president,  he said in another post that was deleted before we had a chance to snag a screenshot in June.  Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! In numerous other posts, Dutcher discussed killing the President, even expressing a desire for the Secret Service to  step out of the way long enough for someone    like him    to take the shot  so the President could be  exucuted.   Dutcher also said that he had a stockpile of fully automatic weapons and ammunitions, as well as plastic explosives, mortars, and other things that would make any NRA member s pants tighten a bit.With all that heavy equipment, it was shocking that Dutcher was arrested with After Tough Guy s arrest on July 2, Dutcher told Secret Service that he meant what he said, and he absolutely intended to use the slingshot to kill the  usurper. Dutch  was detained for 24 hours at a mental health facility in La Crosse, where he threatened the staff and accused them of   helping the tyrant.  He was then moved to Dane County Jail. He said he was very accurate with a slingshot,  Secret Service Special Agent Jeffrey Ferris testified.  His true intention was to circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher told police that he had hunted animals with the slingshot and that he could kill a human with it. He also referenced the Biblical story of David and Goliath, with Obama apparently being the latter in the tale.Dennis the Menace Dutcher is due to be sentenced for his crimes in March. He faces up to five years in prison for each count, so he may have a long time to sit in the corner and think about what he did.Featured image via Wisconsin State Journal/Wikimedia Commons",0
"LEFTIST MEDIA DESTROYED Mike Flynn, Cracked Jokes After Horrible LIE Obama’s National Security Advisor Told Media, Families Of Benghazi Victims [VIDEO] Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for  primetime. )Here s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this:  It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?  WHAT? Then they joked about football and  Saturday Night Live.   The FederalistWatch here as Susan Rice intentionally lies her way around the different TV networks and Trey Gowdy blasts the double standard of our media:Here is US Ambassador to the UN, who was elevated to Obama s National Security Advisor after she lied to the media and to the American people about Benghazi protests being sparked by a video. Watch Susan Rice explain how she has no regrets about lying about the reason for the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi:Watch here as Susan Rice s promotion to National Security Advisor is explained:",0
" Ben Carson: Homeless Shelters Shouldn’t Be “Comfortable” Because People Might “Stay” If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration. As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.  But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say. He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them. The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say:  I ll just stay here. They will take care of me. It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word  compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit. Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami. While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves. Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",1
"ANOTHER AMERICAN KNOWN WOLF? Fort Lauderdale Shooter Known to FBI, Worked for Security, Amid Backdrop of Mass Drills Shawn Helton 21st Century WireAnother shocking active-shooter incident rocks America. This time, according to Florida s Broward County Sheriff s Department, thirteen people were shot, including five dead, after an apparent shooting rampage took place at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport yesterday.At the moment, there is still no clear motive for the shooting attack and no evidence linking the suspect to terror. However, officials have yet to rule out the possibility of terrorism.The timing of this shooting attack cannot be overstated, as there was a major US intelligence review over an alleged Russian hack influence on America s 2016 election that was scheduled on the very same day   KNOWN WOLF?    What really happened at the Fort Lauderdale airport? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)NOTE: It only took a matter of hours for the Fort Lauderdale shooter s back story to emerge.According to authorities, the suspected airport shooter, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, checked a declared handgun inside his luggage, later retrieving it at Fort Lauderdale Airport s Terminal 2 baggage claim. Santiago then reportedly loaded the gun in a bathroom came out in the terminal opening fire on fellow travelers   including a series of head shots.After the shooting spree, the suspect was reported to have calmly turned himself into the police.#Florida #BreakingNews #FLLSHOOTING Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport #Shooting#Warleak pic.twitter.com/XkU79MTx1J  WarLeak (@WarLeak) January 6, 2017According to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel,  The shooter is in custody and unharmed,  said .

No record he flew Air Canada? Only 2 cops escort away? Friday aftrn standard Dem fake news time pic.twitter.com/8qpi4tnGwL  NeuroTrade (@neurotrade) January 6, 2017The whole series of events is strange to say the least, but the oddities didn t stop there. Santiago-Ruiz s US military background includes service in the Puerto Rico Army National Guard in 2007, according to the Department of Defense. Santiago-Ruiz was listed as a combat engineer who had been deployed to Iraq in April 2010, returning to US soil in 2011. Later in November of 2014, following a move to Alaska, he became a member of the Alaska National Guard. In August of 2016, Santiago-Ruiz was transferred to Inactive Ready Reserve.Additionally, Santiago-Ruiz was stated to be employed by an as of yet unnamed Anchorage security company while living in Alaska.According to the Associated Press and Miami s local CBS News affiliate,  The Pentagon said he [Santiago-Ruiz] went AWOL several times as a specialist during a stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted to private first class, the Associated Press reported. He was given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge. Earlier reports stated that Santiago-Ruiz flew on a flight from Canada. Air Canada promptly denied that the suspected airport shooter was on any of their flights. Other US mainstream outlets later stated that he arrived on an in-bound Delta Airlines flight instead.  AIRPORT SHOOTING     Esteban Santiago is in custody following a shooting at a Fort Lauderdale airport. Authorities gathered travelers on the tarmac after the incident. (Image Source: Chicago Tribune)Interestingly, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was on the scene of the shooting, and was  live-tweeting :I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running.  Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017Another Known Wolf?As 21 WIRE has documented over the years, many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place. A place where a  lone wolf  graduates into the ranks of a known wolf. In fact, very often those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell-tale signs of a patsy or an informant, working either for a law enforcement or intelligence agency. Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various role in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide actors in an actual attacks.  In any case, alleged attackers and security agencies have a dicey relationship, making any link between them highly suspect in nature.In January of 2015, a strategic security service think-tank known as The Soufan Group, reported that a larger national security threat resides with radicals who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies: The Soufan Group, a New York think tank, said a better term for  lone wolves  would be  known wolves , given how many are already known to Western intelligence agencies before they strike. These individuals, acting alone or in small groups   have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations, highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism,  it said in a report this week The Fort Lauderdale shooting story rapidly emerged out of corporate media halls looking to sell the public on the latest tragic shooting in America. The Hollywood International Airport shooting has elements of other high-profile shooting events in recent history, such as the TSA/LAX shooting, the the Tucson shooting, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, the San Bernardino shooting attack, the Chattanooga military base shooting siege, as well as the aspects of the Aurora theater shooting and the Grand theater shooting in Lafayette and many others.Is the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter another case of a known wolf   triggered into action?The apparent Fort Lauderdale airport shooter, Santiago-Ruiz, who is said to be Puerto Rican was born in New Jersey (living in Alaska), and was well-known to authorities, having recently undergone a mental health evaluation after allegedly visiting an FBI office in Alaska where he claimed he was under  CIA mind control,  with voices in his head telling him to join ISIS : They say last November, he walked into the FBI s office in Anchorage, Alaska, claiming that  his mind was being controlled by the CIA and that it was forcing him to join ISIS. He appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements   and although he said he didn t wish to hurt anyone, agents were concerned by his erratic behavior and decided to call local authorities, a senior federal law enforcement official said.Local police took him to a local medical facility for evaluation, and the FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews with family members, the official said. NEW: In Nov. 2016, FLL suspect walked into FBI office in Anchorage, claiming he was being forced to fight for ISIS, sources tell CBS News.  CBS News (@CBSNews) January 6, 2017Shades of the Manchurian Candidate?We re also told that the suspect s aunt had flagged his mentally unstable condition previously. According to USA Today:Yet the troubling episode is now part of an emerging profile of a deeply disturbed man described by his aunt Friday as someone who had  lost his mind. Maria Luisa Ruiz of Union City, N.J., said her nephew, who had moved to Alaska for work as a security guard, only recently began to show signs of instability. Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,  she said He said he saw things. The inclusion of Santiago-Ruiz s alleged  voices  in his head, supposedly triggered by the CIA, immediately recalls another bizarre case that was also difficult to comprehend   the Navy Yard Shooter from 2013.Here s a passage from a 21WIRE report discussing the apparent Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis: Rather than get caught up in the  fear campaigns  sold to us by our favorite news anchor-zombies, its important to consider another aspect of these mass shootings by making a tally of  the trigger points that media uses to manipulate public perception, as they carefully propagandize certain elements within a crisis making sure to illicit  the right  reaction from every major demographic. Is this what we are seeing in the aftermath of the Fort Lauderdale shooting?Heavy.com added the following details about the supposedly troubled Santiago-Ruiz:The shooter   whose troubled behavior had already drawn the attention of the FBI, Army, and Anchorage police   arrived Friday afternoon at the busy airport on a flight from Alaska, with the gun used in the shooting properly stored in his checked baggage, NBC News reports.One report said the shooter, who lived in Alaska, had no other luggage but the gun, which federal rules allow a person to declare at a ticket counter and check under the plane but not carry on. In addition to Santiago-Ruiz s lengthy time with the US military and the National Guard, in recent years, the suspected shooter was involved in various crimes. Here s a passage from The Daily Beast describing some of Santiago s background: According to charging documents provided by the Anchorage prosecutor s office to The Daily Beast, on January 10, 2016, Santiago verbally assaulted his then girlfriend, a 40-year old mother of one child from a previous marriage whom The Daily Beast is not naming, through a locked bathroom door, telling her to  Get the fuck out, bitch.  After he forced his way in by breaking down the door, he smacked her in the head and strangled her. By the time police arrived, Santiago had fled the scene.Santiago was arrested days later and released on the condition that he have no contact with the victim, but in February, Anchorage police found him at his girlfriend s residence and he was charged for violating the conditions of his release. That case is still pending.Alaska court records show a criminal record under Santiago s name for minor traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without insurance and a broken taillight. Records also show his landlord evicted him for non-payment of rent in February 2015.The assault case was resolved in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, an alternative to adjudication where prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for Esteban s completion of requirements, the details of which are unknown. While Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Daily Beast that previous charges against Santiago-Ruiz are unlikely to be dropped following the airport shooting   you still have to wonder what  requirements  were asked of Santiago-Ruiz to get the alleged assault charges dropped from his record in the first place, given the brutal nature of them.FOX NEWS echoes a Sun Sentinel report,  Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the Sun Sentinel reported.The same FOX report adds the following about Santiago-Ruiz s alleged lengthy mental health battle: Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. We have not talked for the past three weeks,  Bryan Santiago said.  That s a bit unusual   I m in shock. He was a serious person   He was a normal person. Mass Shooting Distraction?Another aspect to these highly emotive and polarizing known wolf shooting events, is that usually they dominate US media coverage for several days. As other charged elements of an alleged shooter/attacker are propagandized, such as Santiago-Ruiz s Palestinian scarf image (seen on the left) seized upon by FOX News anchors who fused Santiago-Ruiz s allegedly  ISIS-like  hand gesture with the Gaza-Israeli conflict.The shocking scene at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport occurred the same exact day US intelligence leaders briefed President-elect Donald Trump on so-called Russian hack allegations in the lead up to the 2016 election.Back in September of 2016, while examining the aftermath of the New York and New Jersey bomb plot/attack, we analyzed whether a deeper social engineering agenda might have been at play   as part of a larger geopolitical drama unfolded in Syria appeared to be masked by media.When looking deeper, we discovered other overlapping stories that coincided alongside the  known wolf  NYC bomber. Here s a passage that discussed the NYC attack that seemed to bury Western coverage regarding a vicious airstrike campaign that killed dozens of members of Syria s army: You have to wonder, were the events in New York and New Jersey also a weapon of mass distraction, following a major international embarrassment for the United States both at home and abroad   the brutal airstrike campaign in Syria that killed over 70 Syrian troops? This unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the UN General Assembly in NYC, where President Obama was delivering among other speeches, his War on Terror  addresses to the international community. No surprise then, with the city suddenly on  high terror alert    that Obama quickly, confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the UN, shifting into  national security  mode   boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case. It was almost if he was ready for events that weekend. Similarly, you have to consider if this new high-profile shooting event at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport will dominate the news cycle, as the US intelligence community scrambles to prove Russian hack allegations over the next week.On January 4th ABC News reported the following: The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia s alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News.President-elect Donald Trump, who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA.U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. Interestingly, other explosive high-profile stories went to the back burner, such as the Chicago kidnapping and teen torture story  and the fallout from CNN s Don Lemon following his egregious comments after the tragic racially motivated attack.Media Memory: Reports of a  Second Shooter  at Terminal 1During the later hours of the US mainstream media coverage, networks like CNN were still floating the possibility of a second shooter, as reports emerged of shots fired in the adjacent terminal housing United Airlines, Terminal 1.Interestingly, local reports also reported eye-witness accounts of a  second gunman  involved in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. Here s a passage from an ABC News affiliate discussing the reports of a second gunman at the Fort Lauderdale shooting: All day I ve heard people talking about second incidences,  Catie Rutledge wrote on Instagram.  After waiting on the tarmac for hours and hunting someone down to get our bags, we are now waiting for a bus, so that we can leave the airport. There was panic when authorities feared there was a second gunman. Law enforcement asked travelers to seek shelter. Fear prompted many to say their final good byes to loved ones. Some frightened parents were in tears as they tried to protect their children. This aspect of the case seemingly disappeared from media outlets following Santiago-Ruiz s arrest.The phenomena of multiple shooters being immediately reported after an apparent mass shooting event was also echoed during both the Orlando nightclub shooting and the San Bernardino attack in 2015.Later in the evening, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel confirmed that there was no second shooter   despite previous reports. The suspect was being interrogated by the FBI. This statement was in stark contrast to multiple witness statements made on national TV, placing the series of shots, or perhaps an additional series of shots and subsequent crowds fleeing in panic at Terminal 1  that would either be instead of Terminal 2, or in addition to it. This wasn t just an anomaly   this was backed up by at least 2 different witnesses on CNN, perhaps more in other reports which 21WIRE has yet to collate here.Was this a case of something that happened in Terminal 1  either part of a drill, or another gunman   which was memory-holed by the media and DHS, or could this be we are looking at planted witnesses who got their lines wrong? This is a fair question to ask, considering we are talking about multiple witnesses stating the shots and crowds panicking in Terminals other than the official story in Terminal 2.Here are four alternative witnesses:Witness 1: CNN s coverage of the  Active Shooter  festival at Fort Lauderdale Airport reveals yet another anomaly in their story. CNN reported the alleged shooter, Esteban Santiago, shot 5 people dead in the Delta Terminal 2, and yet, all the witnesses reported 4 shots fired in the United Terminal 1. When this witness, a father who flew in from Chicago, tells of the United T1 shots fired, CNN s reporter Boris Sanchez appears to panic, possibly then receiving a feed in his ear and then essentially tells the witness  you are wrong, there were no shots fired in United Terminal 1.  Was this bad reporting, or bad stage management by CNN? Watch:  Witness 2: Immediately after CNN s Boris Sanchez mix-up with man flying in from Chicago at United Terminal 1, another CNN witness was suddenly produced, going by the name of  Ryan Ward , interviewed by Jim Sciutto, then comes on, using very scripted language apparently in an attempt to clean-up the inconsistent statements of the last witness. Ryan Ward describes the mayhem, people running,  luggage flying  and  people screaming, gunman coming    even though he admits he was NOT in Delta Terminal 2 where police report the actual shooting took place. Ward claims he was in a wheel chair because of back surgery, but then claims he  got up and ran over  to save a little girl and  I ran back over and pushed the mom into a corner and laid on top of her . He then says that,  It does sound like it was an unsubstantiated second threat, but people certainly weren t acting like it    here he was mirroring the identical language used by the previous CNN reporters. Coincidence? Even more oddly, Ward claims he was flying Jet Blue, and that the,  Jet Blue staff were really great    only problem is that Jet Blue is in Terminal 3, and not in T1 or T2. Watch: Witness 3: Another witness, testifying multiple gunman on the scene, although the Terminal location being referenced by this 3rd witness is somewhat unclear:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhiSblZtJs . Also, there is an additional media report by Intellihub of a pilot, in uniform and on-site, who also testifies about a loud commotion, with police in pursuit of a perpetrator seen in Terminal 1   a stark contrast to the official story: The pilot believes that  there was another shooting  in Terminal 1 that law enforcement and the F.B.I. are likely covering up.  I could hear females screaming and people running away from terminal 1. The pilot said he feels that it was definitely  some kind of combined effort to attack  the airport.In addition to that, here is a fifth witness, seen in this unconfirmed cell phone video from a female passenger out on the airport tarmac   apparently from Terminal 1, and referencing a second shooter event located after the TSA barrier   which seems to be a different location to the baggage check area:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tayCW0pTBF8 . EDITORS NOTE: If readers have any other witness reports of a  Second Shooter  or shots fired in Terminal 2, please leave them below in the comment section.Here s an ABC News feature with Mark Lea, an apparent eye-witness (later photographed the crime scene) who came  face-to-face  with Santiago-Ruiz   who also rather incredibly, managed to not get shot during the encounter Fort Lauderdale s  Active Shooter  DrillsVery often preceding an apparent shooting/attack there is the presence of mass casualty drills. Fort Lauderdale was no exception.In 2015, the Sun Sentinel reported the following: At a Fort Lauderdale cinema Wednesday, two men in camouflage gear calmly walked down the aisle and fired rifles and handguns at moviegoers.Twenty-seven volunteers were  injured  in three theaters during the drill.Fort Lauderdale police guarded and escorted paramedics wearing protective gear to tend to the wounded actors, even though the  shooters  weren t captured and blank gunfire echoed elsewhere in the Riverwalk movie complex.The agencies  goal is to speed up paramedics  responses during mass killings, domestic calls and other violent incidents. Similarly, in June of 2016, an inter-agency meeting described future protocols regarding mass drills: The meeting, held every quarter, is an opportunity for agencies to coordinate with one another and discuss the latest techniques in fighting domestic terror attacks.Last month, agencies participated in an active-shooter exercise at the Fort Lauderdale Postal Facility.In February, the group participated in Operation Heat Shield, consisting of weapons of mass destruction and an active shooting drill.Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County Sheriff s Office and Sheriff Rick Bradshaw of Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office said these training exercises are important. With such a large law enforcement effort to tackle the active-shooter, you have to wonder why and how these events seem to coincide with major attacks on US soil.Here s a YouTube video from commentator Peekay Truth discussing aspects of this latest mass shooting tragedy in America https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYY0EgDRYgcDupes, Informants and PawnsAdditionally, as we ve mentioned before, during the aftermath of 2014 s Canadian Parliament Shooting in Ottawa, we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events globally and other mass casualty incidents often seen in America.The shocking event, like other bizarre attacks in recent years, have often distorted public opinion, pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized crimes.The suspected Parliament Hill and National War Memorial shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, (Left Image: therightscoop) had the perfect  modus operandi  and r sum  to be an informant for either a law enforcement or intelligence agency.According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security services   who had also seized his passport. Was this the reason why the Zehaf-Bibeau snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant?Other terror stooges and suspicious intelligence  informant  cases include the following:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal  (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar  (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa  (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here)As we ve mentioned here at 21WIRE before, many political leaders and media operatives bang the drums of security over so-called terror  sleeper cells hiding in a nation near you   none of them acknowledge the historical fact that they themselves have also helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through counter-terrorism operations for decades.It is important to mention again, that the FBI created the counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO) to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out. Between 1956 and 1971 (including the Socialist Workers party in 1973), the FBI s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America.As we stated after the suspicious Oregon campus shooting in 2015, mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event, as they have with many others incidents. The Fort Lauderdale shooting appears once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of items (in this case mental-health, supported by online rants on social media) about the persona of a shooter as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the case of Fort Lauderdale is no different, as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.All too often we ve seen the  stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence reaches a court room.For the average person, it s hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event, causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The whole episode seemed akin to the WTC 1993 bombing case, which involved yet another informant working alongside officials.The Gun Control & Security AgendaAs pointed out in 21WIRE during 2015 s Oregon campus shooting, the primary focus for mass media concerning the Fort Lauderdale incident, will now be all of the hot button socio-political issues including  gun control-reform  and those concerned over  mental illness  background checks, along with those who constitutionally oppose such restrictive legislation.It should be obvious by now that events like Fort Lauderdale, along with other  mass-shootings , have become a sharp catalyst to usher in calls for endless new  mass shooting  protocols, inter-agency  fusion ,  first-responder  emergency medical protocols, and also for injecting more and more military terminology into civilian life   with the media playing a critical role in steering the public away from questioning any of the dubious elements surrounding any shooting event.In a sense, the media is helping to nudge these shooting events out of the forensic sphere and into the political arena as quickly as possible, effectively closing the feedback loop of concerned citizens and those who may have been affected by an event.The Fort Lauderdale shooting has prompted the mainstream media to feed into concerns over airport security, gun ownership and a persons mental health background. All of media s fear-inducing drama regarding the Fort Lauderdale shooting boils down to a contentious battle over gun reform and mental health as the Obama administration comes to a close. No doubt this latest shooting will give cause to new security measures in airports across America.Here s another look at outgoing President Obama discussing his frustration on gun control in a  legacy  interview with the BBC from 2015   amazingly, only a few hours before a mass shooting in Lafayette *UPDATE*  Broward Sheriff Scott Israel stated that deputies arrived on the scene between  60 to 70 seconds  after the Fort Lauderdale shooting took place   quite an incredible response time by most law enforcement standards.TMZ acquired footage of the Fort Lauderdale shooter in action   the video appears to display elements of staging   decide for yourself According to reports,  Airport officials, along with federal and local authorities, are investigating who had access to the footage and who allowed it to be taped without authorization, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief told the Sun Sentinel. *UPDATE* Just one week prior to the Fort Lauderdale shooting,  Florida lawmakers began rallying support for SB 140, a state bill that would repeal laws which, among other things, ban guns in airport terminals like the one where the shooting occurred.

"JUST IN: OBAMA APPOINTED JUDGE Presiding Over Michael Flynn’s Case SUDDENLY Recuses Himself…CLINTON Appointed Judge Will Sentence Flynn Now, a Clinton appointed judge who took Flynn s guilty plea has suddenly recused himself and Flynn will now face an Obama appointed judge for his sentencing. Hmmm Politico   President Donald Trump s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, will face a different judge to be sentenced than the one who took Flynn s guilty plea to a felony false statement charge last week, court records show.Judge Emmet Sullivan was randomly assigned to take over the case after Judge Rudolph Contreras recused himself.A court spokeswoman confirmed to POLITICO that the reassignment of the case was due to Contreras  recusal, but did not immediately respond to a query about the reason.Sullivan is an appointee of President Bill Clinton, while Contreras was appointed by President Barack Obama.Flynn pleaded guilty last Friday to a false statement charge brought by prosecutors from the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

" Donald Trump Is An Illegitimate President-Elect Because Russia Helped Him Steal Election Russian interference in our election should immediately disqualify Donald Trump from the presidency.On Friday, a CIA assessment found that the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies and officials is that Russia hacked our election system to not only hurt American confidence in our democratic institutions but to help Trump win against Hillary Clinton.According to the Washington Post,The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances.This, of course, is a huge blow to Trump s legitimacy because he and his transition team have been strenuously insisting that Trump won by historic margins and that the country needs to unite behind him and kiss his ass. Now we know why.In response to the CIA report, Trump s team issued what amounts to a  nothing to see here, move along  statement, all while throwing intelligence officials under the bus. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It s now time to move on and  Make America Great Again. In fact, most intelligence officials and agencies warned President Bush that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So Trump just pushed a Bush Administration lie in order to hurt the credibility of our intelligence agencies.Also, Trump s  victory  is hardly one of the biggest in history. This is merely Trump trying to convince everyone that he s legitimate by exaggerating his election performance. The only problem is that we have the records from past elections. All of them. In just the last century alone, 18 other presidential election victories are bigger than Donald Trump s. That includes President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012.Furthermore, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which Trump is desperately trying to undermine by claiming that 3 million people voted illegally.Evidence of Russian hacking is what originally caused activists to call for recounts late last month in three battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. A recount in underway in Wisconsin while courts are preventing them in the other two as Green Party candidate Jill Stein continues to fight for election integrity.Now that our intelligence services have concluded that Russia DID hack our election in an effort to help Trump steal the election, it is more important than ever to make sure these recounts happen. In fact, they should happen in every state. Until then, Donald Trump should be considered an illegitimate president-elect.The fact that Trump and his team have been desperately trying to kill these recount effort is even more suspicious and gives the appearance that they are trying to hide something or prevent something from being discovered.Let s also not forget that Donald Trump himself encouraged Russia to continue hacking American institutions for his benefit. And they obeyed his request.This is a serious moment for our democracy. Allowing Trump to take office while ignoring the evidence that he cheated to win will only irrevocably damage American confidence in the integrity of our elections it will set a dangerous precedent. If Trump is allowed to get away with being aided by foreign agents, nothing stops Republicans or even Democrats from employing the same strategy in future elections. This needs to be stopped now before it it too late and the only way to do that is to stop Donald Trump from taking office and declaring Hillary Clinton the true victor.Impossible, you say? Not so fast. As it turns out, there is precedent for installing a defeated candidate when evidence of fraud is found. Huffington Post notes that a state Senate race in Pennsylvania was overturned and awarded to Republican Bruce Marks over Democrat William Stinson after real evidence of voter fraud was brought to light.Two of the elected officials who testified in the Pennsylvania case said under oath that they were aware of the fraud, had intentionally failed to enforce laws, and hurried to certify Stinson the winner in order to bury the story. The narrative recalls the Washington Post s revelation that Republican Mitch McConnell was aware of the CIA s conclusion that Russians had intervened and opted to do nothing.In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that Marks be sworn in to fill the Senate seat.So not only could the courts restore election integrity by ordering Trump to step aside, they can install Hillary Clinton as the true President of the United States by citing Russian interference in the election. The Electoral College could intervene as well by not voting for Donald Trump on December 19th. They should vote for Clinton instead.The bottom line is that Donald Trump had outside help, which means he owes Russian a huge favor should he be allowed to take office. Russia would own him and that puts our nation at serious risk. Russian interference makes Trump illegitimate and he should be disqualified from holding office. If we really care about our democracy, this is what needs to be done.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images",0
"WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO] That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking home through his affluent Washington DC neighborhood. He was beaten and shot in the back, but apparently nothing of any value was taken from his body, which would likely mean robbery was not a motive. If robbery wasn t a motive and the police still have no clues what exactly was the motive for his brutal murder? In our previous article, we explored the possibility that he may have been about to blow the whistle on voter fraud. Does anyone have an actual tally of the number of people who had ties to the Clintons that ended up dead? Now Bernie Sanders supporter and activist Shawn Lucas is found dead.On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.According to Snopes Lucas was found dead on his bathroom floor.We contacted Lucas  employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas  death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas  cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone. Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.Watch here:And on June 22, 2016, former UN official John Ashe  accidentally  crushed his own throat and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons and Democrat Party.Via: Gateway Pundit",1

"NYC BOMBER’S DAD Reveals Son’s Terrorist Attack Could Have Been Stopped If They’d Listened To Him…The FBI Clearly Missed That Narrative  Two years before the bombings that Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of carrying out in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that his son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two law enforcement officials.The father, Mohammad Rahami, in a brief interview on Tuesday, said that at the time he told agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his concern, his son had just had a fight with another of his sons and stabbed the man, leading to a criminal investigation. Two years ago I go to the F.B.I. because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?  he said.  But they check almost two months, they say,  He s O.K., he s clean, he s not a terrorist.  I say O.K. He added:  Now they say he is a terrorist. I say O.K. It is not clear if officers ever interviewed Ahmad Rahami, but as investigators turn their focus to what might have motivated, inspired or led him to plant bombs in Chelsea in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, new clues are emerging indicating that he may have been increasingly receptive to extremist ideology.When Mr. Rahami was captured during a shootout with the police on Monday, the authorities found a notebook, pierced with a bullet hole and covered in blood, expressing opinions sympathetic to jihadist causes, according to a law enforcement official who agreed to speak about the investigation only on the condition of anonymity.Read more: NYT",1
" Friend Of Stanford Rapist: Not Everyone Who Rapes In College Is A Rapist Absolutely everything about the story of Brock Turner, the convicted Stanford swim team rapist, is gag-worthy. He received a particularly light sentence (more on that in a bit), his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just  20 minutes of action.  Now, a friend of Turner has spoken and her (yes her) attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well, he s in college, or something like that.Apparently, according to Turner s childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus: I don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists. Then, the obligatory victim blaming: This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement. No, this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far. This was a violent sexual assault. Here s just some of it, as retold by the victim:He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don t ask, can I finger you? Usually there s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that s why she wore the cardigan.Clearly, calling Turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness. It s simply a fact. Brock was convicted of three felony counts. While the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been 10 years, he will likely only serve three months. As horrendously unjust as that sentence is, it s still about three months longer than 97 percent of rapists serve. That s political incorrectness if I ve ever heard it.Featured image via video screen grab. ",0
"HILLARY TWEETS MESSAGE In Defense Of DACA…OOPS! 2014 VIDEO Of Hillary EMERGES Saying Illegal Kids Should Be Sent Back No time to waste   we've got to fight with everything we've got to #DefendDACA. Thanks, @jorgeramosnews, for sharing these powerful stories. https://t.co/rNtZZ4ONBy  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 4, 2017Mediaite   But what about the interview Hillary did with CNN s Christiane Amanpour to promote her previous book,  Hard Choices ? A video has emerged showing the interview where Hillary told Amanpour that she believed the DACA kids should be sent back.During the exchange, Clinton had some tough words for the children of illegal immigrants, including waves of unaccompanied minors coming in 2014   telling Amanpour that the United States was a nation of laws and that they probably had to go.Watch at the 2:20 mark: The exchange went like this:AMANPOUR:  So, you re saying they should be sent back now? CLINTON:  Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we ve got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security.But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn t mean the child gets to stay. So, we don t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey. Of course, Hillary is never one to keep her promises. As soon as she began campaigning, she began to change her tune on DACA: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,  said Clinton.  But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. ",1

During a photo op at the White House with the Chicago Cubs, ABC News Jon Karl asked Trump if he d be  willing to negotiate with all of them. Trump s response was to slam Schumer, because, of course it was.I better find out if he s serious. He hasn t been serious. Obamacare is such a disaster, such a wreck, and he wants to try and save something that s really hurting a lot of people  He d have to be very, very serious. You know, he s done a lot of talking, bad talking, and he just doesn t seem like a serious person. Trump, who is a freaking reality show star, seriously has the nerve to sit there and say that Schumer  doesn t seem like a serious person?

"MOM AND 3 YOUNG DAUGHTERS Wearing Shorts, T-Shirts STABBED In French Resort Town By Moroccan Man For Being “Scantily Dressed”…”The religious motive of the attack is in no doubt” Remember when the French used to mock conservatives for being so closed-minded and unaccepting of their liberal values?

" Michigan Republicans Pass Bill That Would Put Gay AND Straight Couples In Prison Conservative lawmakers are far too obsessed with how people have sex.In defiance of the Supreme Court, Michigan Republicans have passed a bill that makes oral and anal sex felonies punishable by up to 15 years in prison.State Senator Rick Jones, an old white right-wing guy who is apparently angry about all the sex he s not having, added the anti-sex language to SB 219, which is supposed to be an animal protection bill, included in a larger package of bills known as Logan s Law.Logan s Law is designed to block convicted animal abusers from owning any pets for five years, but Jones couldn t wait to use the bill to push his own belief that consenting adults who have oral and anal sex should be left to rot in a jail cell. He slipped in language revising the unconstitutional anti-sodomy law near the very end of the bill in a move that Jones probably hoped would go unnoticed.Here s a screenshot of Section 158 of Senate Bill 219.Despite calls for Jones to remove the section, he claims that to do so would hurt the animal protection bill as a whole. The minute I cross that line and I start talking about the other stuff, I won t even get another hearing. It ll be done,  Jones said.  Nobody wants to touch it. I would rather not even bring up the topic, because I know what would happen. You d get both sides screaming and you end up with a big fight that s not needed because it s unconstitutional. But Jones is the one who crossed the line in the first place by sneaking in his dream of outlawing oral and anal sex between humans into an animal protection bill. He s the one who willingly put the overall bill in jeopardy.Jones went on to claim that he believes the only way to repeal the sodomy ban is if the state passes a bill to do so, which he says he could  probably  vote for.The Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003, but conservatives across the country have been fighting to keep the laws on the books ever since. That includes Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia who tried to outlaw  carnal knowledge  between married couples in 2013 as he failed to become the state s governor.And just like Cuccinelli, it appears Jones is trying to insert Christian fundamentalist law into the civil law, which would create a legal clusterf*ck in this country since it would destroy privacy. In order to enforce such a law, it would take millions upon millions of dollars, a spying program, and a cop in every household to make sure women and men are only doing it missionary style and that their reproductive organs are in the place where they believe God intended them to be.In short, whenever Republicans say they support smaller government, they are full of shit, and so is Rick Jones. But I bet Justice Scalia is totally behind him all the way. Featured image from Facebook",0
" WATCH: CNN NAILS Trump For Lie That He Would Never Demand Loyalty Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",0

So you re gonna be hearing a lot more from them these people who are all, you know, aligned around trying to discredit Maxine Waters because she has stayed on Trump s case so much. And so you re going to hear a lot more from them. Don t believe anything they re saying. ",0

" The White House Just Confessed The REAL Reason For Syria Attack; It Is DISGUSTING (DETAILS) While many have been baffled and upset by Donald Trump s reckless decision to attack Syria (without Congressional approval), the inner details of what drove Trump to make such a decision are even worse.Senior White House officials have just confessed that this attack against Syria was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Trump, to feed his out of control ego. According to those officials, the poorly planned missile strike (which ultimately failed) isn t even part of a broader strategy or a step in a larger plan to remove Assad. It was absolutely meaningless, and its only purpose was to make Trump seem like a strong leader.CNN s Jim Acosta reported:While it s not surprising that Trump has no strategy for Syria (let s face it, he has zero strategy for anything he does), it s terrifying to actually see it play out before our eyes as an incompetent president puts America in grave danger.Basically, Trump used the U.S. military to make it LOOK like he was taking some sort of action on Syria, when really the exact opposite is true. There is no plan, and there likely will never be one. What Trump put on last night was merely a performance   and a damaging one. Already, U.S.-Russia relations have grown more tense as Russia is making moves to punish America for Trump s carelessness.The message Trump is sending to the world is terrifying   what we can expect during Trump s presidency is a show; just big empty gestures that won t actually carry any weight. Trump has basically shown Assad that he s not really going to do anything besides send 50 missiles his way. Now Assad   and the rest of the world   knows our president is all talk and almost no action. The strength and leadership that America once had in the world is disintegrating quickly.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",0
" One Of Hillary’s Opponents Could Drop Out And Endorse Her (VIDEO) Every four years, we re told that the upcoming presidential election is the most important in our lifetimes. While it does seem that every election cycle the consequences become much more serious, this one is particularly notable because, regardless of politics, it s a clear choice between sane and insane.Donald Trump is insane. Obviously, we re not saying that in a clinical way because fortunately, we ve never met him, but he s thin-skinned, narcissistic, a pathological liar and doesn t give a crap about anyone other than himself. Politics aside, those qualities should keep him out of office.While there are a number of third party candidates running this time around, only one third party ticket is on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and that s the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and his vice presidential candidate Bill Weld.Famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein believes the Johnson/Weld ticket might not hold up for long, and that Weld could be dropping out of the race to support Hillary Clinton.The Green Party ticket is on the ballot in 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian ticket is currently polling at 9 percent and the Green Party ticket is polling at 3 percent. Many are saying that the third party tickets are siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump and according to Bernstein, Weld might not be able to live with that fact. He has  another day to fight for libertarianism,  according to Bernstein. He also believes that Weld could help bring Millennials into the Democratic fold. Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader,   says Bernstein. Nader, as you recall, ran against Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 and many say that Gore would have won if Nader had not been in the race.Bernstein also feels that Weld is spinning his wheels on the Johnson ticket. He called Johnson a  flake,  and said that Weld wants to make a difference and the difference he can make is supporting Clinton.Here s the video:Could Libertarian VP candidate renounce his candidacy?

The snarky DC reporters always try and get her but she ends up on top every time! This time was no exception;Daily Caller reports:The GOP tax reform bill is the most talked-about thing in the country right now. When NBC asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders about its effects Thursday, Sanders pointed to the huge bonuses many at NBC will be receiving because of the bill.Multiple corporations announced a mix of thousand-dollar bonuses, pay increases and heavy sums of charitable giving in response to the tax cuts.One of those corporations was Comcast-NBCUniversal.Sarah Sanders  made use of the fact that journalists are getting a pay raise under this tax cut, in part because there was so much misinformation about the tax cut in media. CNN s Brian Stelter tweeted the report with this comment last night:Sanders responded to Stelter s comment with this reminder:The left has been tripped up numerous times in the past few days. Chuck Schumer claimed that AT&T employees would suffer because of the tax bill but they came out with a great bonus for employees right after the bill passed in the Senate:Democrats have played the drama queen role calling the tax bill  Armageddon .

" Americans BLAST Hypocrite Mitch McConnell For Whining About Democrat Plan To Block Trump’s SCOTUS Noms Karma is a bitch and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is learning that the hard way.For nearly a year, Republicans viciously blocked President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in a purely partisan refusal to do their jobs out of sheer hatred and contempt.Donald Trump is now set to take over the White House and now McConnell is whining because Democrats are about to demonstrate what  turnabout is fair play  means.Senator Chuck Schumer and his Democratic minority intend to block Trump s Supreme Court picks, indefinitely if need be to make sure Republicans do not get to fill the empty seat.So, McConnell complained by talking about the non-existent  Biden rule,  which Republican used to justify they re refusal to confirm Garland and then had the gall to claim that Americans won t tolerate the blocking of Trump s nominees. I noticed my counterpart Sen. Schumer announced yesterday that their goal was apparently to never fill the Supreme Court vacancy. That s kind of an expansion of Biden rule. You recall the Biden rule in 1992 was the Senate would not confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of a presidential election year, which was my view last year. Sen. Schumer said in the second Bush administration that they would not confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the last eighteen months of President Bush s forty-three s tenure. Apparently, there s yet a new standard now, which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that s something that the American people simply will not tolerate, and we ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it. Here s the video via Twitter.McConnell:  The American people simply will not tolerate  Democrats blocking Trump s SCOTUS nominee https://t.co/9b6sqFrQTM  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 4, 2017To the contrary, Americans, who voted against Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote (millions more if you count the other candidates on the ballot) very much disagree with McConnell and blasted his hypocrisy.@SenateMajLdr Fuck you and your hypocrisy  Jeremy M (@thismyshow) January 5, 2017@SenateMajLdr Mitch, prepare to meet karma.

" Trump Just Accidentally Gave America The Greatest Reason Not To Vote For Him Donald Trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him, and instead he just handed the rest of America a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected.At a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or not, he told his followers that if he loses, he ll go into hiding, never to be seen again.Signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another Republican should he lose the nomination, Trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor. Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says,  I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. So Trump made his supporters a promise: I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans. He s hated by young people. He s hated by the one group the GOP could always count on, white men (yes, really).He s the most hated politician in three decades. The last person who came close? Richard Nixon post-Watergate. Even Dick Cheney   at the lowest moments of the Bush years   was hated by (slightly) fewer people.That s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant Donald Trump never shows his face in front of a camera again. It s hard to imagine a better way Donald Trump could Make America Great Again than that. And Trump just promised to do it.The stakes in this election, already very high, just became: President Trump vs. Trump never being seen again. Pray America makes the right choice.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",0
"BREAKING: FLINT’S DEMOCRAT MAYOR SUED After Whistleblower Rats Her Out For STEALING DONATIONS Meant For Residents Democrats looking for attention and along with every celebrity who has been able to find their way to the burned out city of Flint, MI have all jumped on the  It s all Michigan s Republican Governor Snyder s fault  bandwagon. In reality, there has been plenty of blame to go around. Obama s EPA Director, Gina McCarthy has plenty of culpability when it comes to the involvement of her EPA officials and the cover up of the Flint water crisis. In the end however, it s never about the people of Flint, it s about saving the hides of the inept political officials who allowed this crisis to happen. Flint Lives really don t Matter to greedy politicians like Hillary Clinton, who have used the horrible misfortune of Flint residents to gain trust and votes in the black community.Will anyone remember Hillary s support for black Democrat Mayor Karen Weaver, who is now being accused of STEALING money from charitable donations (that should have been used to support the people who are suffering in the community where she was elected) and putting it into her own campaign fund?The Flint water crisis has triggered yet another lawsuit, this one filed by the city s former administrator, who claims she was wrongfully fired for blowing the whistle on the mayor of Flint for allegedly trying to steer money from a charity for local families into a campaign fund.Former City Administrator Natasha Henderson, 39, who now lives in Muskegon, claims in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court that she was terminated on Feb. 12 for seeking an investigation into allegations of misconduct by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver.Specifically, the suit alleges that Weaver directed a city employee and volunteer to steer donors away from a charity called Safe Water/Safe Homes, and instead give money to the so-called  Karenabout Flint  fund, which was a political action committee or campaign fund created at Weaver s direction.According to the lawsuit, a city employee told Henderson in confidence that she and a volunteer had previously been directing donors to the City of Flint s website, where they could give money to the Safe Water/Safe Homes charity, which helped families affected by the water crisis. But Weaver directed them to steer donors to the  Karenabout Flint  website, which the city council had not approved, the suit claims. A red flag went off when it was an unrecognizable fund,  Henderson s lawyer, Katherine Smith Kennedy, told the Free Press.  She did the right thing. She reported the matter to the city attorney. And for doing the right thing, she was punished. She was fired. The lawsuit names the City of Flint and Weaver as defendants.For entire story: Detroit Free Press",0
" Donald Trump Likes How North Korean Dictator Kills People To Solidify Power (VIDEO) Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents. You ve got to give him credit,  Trump gushed. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that. A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power. Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign. After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies. He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt. He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt. If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr",0

An earlier ABC News broadcast report suggested that a Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization might be the suspect, but that report was incorrect. ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted,  the statement said.On air later in the morning, Ross also said:  An earlier report that I had was incorrect that he was connected with the Tea Party. In fact, that s a different Jim Holmes. He was not connected to the Tea Party and what we do know about him is he is a 24-year-old white male who went to Colorado for a Ph.D.Here s Lyin  Brian Ross  apology after he got caught reporting fake news about the Michael Flynn s meeting with the Russian Ambassador while President Trump was a  candidate .",0
" Donald Trump Throws MASSIVE Hissy Fit Over Hillary’s Speech And DNC Convention Hillary Clinton delivered an amazing speech on Thursday night and the DNC Convention was a unifying success, so of course Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum about it. Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?  the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division. Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us   from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He s taken the Republican Party a long way  from  Morning in America  to  Midnight in America.  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night. He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen. But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016And then he threw a broader tantrum.Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Hillary s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Hillary s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016It should be pointed out that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were not  Hillary s wars.  They were George W. Bush s wars. No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton   corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Then Trump picked up where he left off and continued his hissy fit.The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and  forgot  to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 @AnnCoulter:  I believe in science  Dem code for  we re shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016  Little  Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn t get 10% of the vote   they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary said that I  couldn t handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign.  Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Again, this is who the Republican Party actually thinks is qualified to be the leader of the free world. How will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on Twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him? And keep in mind that Trump only has Twitter to attack people with. As president, he would have the military, drones, and nuclear weapons at his disposal. How can anyone feel safe with Trump as president when he has such a thin skin that he could start a war at any time just because another nation insulted him?Featured Image: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",0
"PARTY CORRUPTION: Clinton Campaign Directly Tied to Disgraced DNC Consultant 21st Century Wire says A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close.   MELTDOWN    The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  POLITICAL BOMBSHELL    Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. (Image Source: Lockerdome)Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas. Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera   he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials.  DNC SCANDAL    Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard)Creamer s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics, potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability.The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here s a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show. The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: In the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. I ll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,  Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled From time to time I get the questions in advance. Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now, as well as a CNN contributor.In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following, while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe. This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons.The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates objected  to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week   something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case.According to a report filed by Zero Hedge, a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik, the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin, Clintion s closest aide.Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, over his alleged foreign business connections.Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news: In 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort s firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash s company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say.That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia   so far, there s nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time.Watch this space   as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.More from LifeZette below   OUT OF CONTROL?    Wikileaks reveals Robby Mook s links to DNC contractor who discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence.

He was sending people to provoke Trump at events.Creamer has thus become a red-hot issue in the campaign. And now it s apparent he is close to Mook.

" One Of Hillary’s Opponents Could Drop Out And Endorse Her (VIDEO) Every four years, we re told that the upcoming presidential election is the most important in our lifetimes. While it does seem that every election cycle the consequences become much more serious, this one is particularly notable because, regardless of politics, it s a clear choice between sane and insane.Donald Trump is insane. Obviously, we re not saying that in a clinical way because fortunately, we ve never met him, but he s thin-skinned, narcissistic, a pathological liar and doesn t give a crap about anyone other than himself. Politics aside, those qualities should keep him out of office.While there are a number of third party candidates running this time around, only one third party ticket is on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and that s the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and his vice presidential candidate Bill Weld.Famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein believes the Johnson/Weld ticket might not hold up for long, and that Weld could be dropping out of the race to support Hillary Clinton.The Green Party ticket is on the ballot in 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian ticket is currently polling at 9 percent and the Green Party ticket is polling at 3 percent. Many are saying that the third party tickets are siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump and according to Bernstein, Weld might not be able to live with that fact. He has  another day to fight for libertarianism,  according to Bernstein. He also believes that Weld could help bring Millennials into the Democratic fold. Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader,   says Bernstein. Nader, as you recall, ran against Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 and many say that Gore would have won if Nader had not been in the race.Bernstein also feels that Weld is spinning his wheels on the Johnson ticket. He called Johnson a  flake,  and said that Weld wants to make a difference and the difference he can make is supporting Clinton.Here s the video:Could Libertarian VP candidate renounce his candidacy?  Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader.    @carlbernstein https://t.co/TzGOzMcM2z  CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) September 17, 2016Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",0

“F*ck Trump! F*ck White People!” LEFTY GOES NUTS On Judge Jeanine…Proves She’s Clueless On Freedom Of Speech [Video] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ7GrEItGoo,0
"SWEDEN IS SCREWED: “Women Who Don’t Wear Headscarf Are Asking To Be Raped” How very diverse! These refugees sure know how to assimilate in their new host countries don t they?Stickers calling for democracy to be replaced with Islam and for women who do not wear a veil to be raped have appeared in public places in Sweden. They have been reported to the police. Pictures of the stickers, which have been stuck to objects on streets in Nybro, Sm land, have been circulating on social media.Jihad Watch   Surprised? Don t be. The Qur an teaches that Infidel women can be lawfully taken for sexual use (cf. its allowance for a man to take  captives of the right hand,  4:3, 4:24, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30). The Qur an says:  O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.  (33:59) The implication there is that if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused, and that such abuse would be justified.How these Muslim migrants have enriched Sweden!One of the stickers reads, in English:  Women who don t wear a headscarf are asking to be raped.  Another reads:  No democracy. We just want Islam,  Fria Tider has reported.The stickers have been reported to the police who are currently investigating who placed them there, but admitted that at the moment they do not know who is behind them.The appearance of the stickers comes just weeks after a number of stickers appeared in nearby Emmaboda bearing the message  Multiculturalism is bad for your children and your grandchildren.  However, those stickers were emblazoned with  Nordfront , the Swedish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement, a national socialist movement. They were also stylised, made to look like the health warnings carried on cigarette packets.But unlike the Nordfront stickers, the Islamist stickers feature plain white text on a plain dark grey background with no logo or marking to indicate who placed them. Consequently, while some people have argued that they were placed by newly arrived asylum seekers with an agenda to promote Islam in Sweden, others have argued that they could be the work of Swedes seeking to  incite hatred  against the immigrants.In that respect, the controversy closely resembles a recent case in which leaflets were posted through letterboxes in Manchester, England, calling on British people not to walk their dogs in public in order for the area to be kept  pure  for Muslims. As citizens of a multicultural nation, those who live in the UK must learn to understand and respect the legacy and lifestyle of the Muslims who live alongside them,  the leaflets read.They were distributed by a group called Public Purity, who stated on their website their intention to have all dogs removed from the public sphere in Britain to keep Muslims pure.  If dogs are not permitted to be present in public, Muslims could live their lives with a burden lifted from their shoulders and without having to fear being tainted with no fault of their own,  the group argued.Via: Breitbart ",0
" New Poll Leaves Trump Camp Terrified As Even TEXAS Leans Hillary A new poll released from the Washington Post and SurveyMonkey has people scratching their heads. For the first time in four months, Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton, 46 to 44 percent, while simultaneously losing all swing states and the red states of Texas and Arizona.The poll, which was done from August 9 to September 1, and had close to 75,000 respondents, shows Trump losing Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado, Michigan and Arizona by two points to Clinton, with all of them being within 2 points of each other, 46-44 percent. Texas, the reddest of all red states in the union, was nabbed by Clinton with 1 point over Trump.How is that? People really, really hate Donald Trump:A comparison of the current survey with the 2008 Texas exit poll (there was no exit poll there in 2012) points to reasons the race appears close right now. Trump is performing worse than 2008 GOP nominee John McCain among both whites and Hispanics, while Clinton is doing slightly better than Obama.So in a national poll, Clinton is losing overall. But in all the states that matter (swing) and states never thought possible (Texas), she s winning.Although Trump is leading, the Post (which says the poll actually shows why Clinton has a clear advantage over Trump) has Clinton solidifying 244 electoral votes to Trump s 126 with 168 being tossups. Of those tossups, which includes 10 states, Clinton leads in six, ties with Trump in two, and Trump leads in two.While Trump supporters may be giddy and Clinton supporters worried, the Post actually contends that Trump is the one who should be worried:Overall, the results reflect Trump s strategy of maximizing support in older, whiter Midwestern states where his anti-free-trade message and appeals to national identity generally find more fertile ground. But his struggles elsewhere, including places that have long supported Republicans, illustrate the challenges of that strategy in more diverse states where his stances on immigration and some other positions have turned off Democrats, independents and many Republicans.>To win the election, Trump must quickly consolidate the Republican vote. With prominent Republicans declaring they will not support Trump and some even announcing they will back Clinton, this represents a major challenge for the GOP nominee. In the Post-SurveyMonkey poll, Clinton is winning 90 percent or more of the Democratic vote in 32 states, while Trump is at or above that level in just 13.It s not Hispanic, Latino, Black, or even female voters that are hurting Trump s chances   it s Republicans. The Obama coalition, which delivered two victories to President Obama in 2008 and 2012, have coalesced around Clinton in larger numbers. But now this election has offered something unique: Republicans are starting to come around to Clinton.With Trump losing the traditional coalition and now with Republicans, chances of him overtaking her are slim.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",1
"AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM GRAND OPENING IRONY: WATCH Police VIOLATE RIGHTS Of Protester Exposing Hillary’s Racist Remarks This is just stunning! Free speech in our nations capitol under Obamas reign is now determined by your political bent Live video archived at Periscope shows U.S. Park Police officers detaining and searching a peaceful anti-Hillary Clinton demonstrator in the area of the opening ceremony for the National Museum of African-American History on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Saturday afternoon.Here is the video the protester is referring to with his sign, where Hillary refers to young black men as  super predators  and suggests we  need to bring them to heel. Trump supporter Jack Posobiec went to the Mall dressed in an orange prison outfit wearing a blond wig and Hillary Clinton mask while holding a sign that read  Blacks are super predators   H  The sign referenced a controversial remark Clinton made while First Lady in the 1990s. Clinton was not at the museum opening that was attended by President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush.DC Police Detained and Frisked me for Anti-Hillary Demonstration pic.twitter.com/CwDE6Ao9N4  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) September 24, 2016After walking around on the sidewalk and closed street on the Mall near the new museum, Posobiec is surrounded by uniformed Park Police officers led by a Black officer who proceeds to interrogate Posobiec and demand his ID. The reasons for detaining and searching Posobiec ranged from  holding a sign , a bogus claim of  threatening the president  by just being there, holding a can of Monster and an implied statement that he was annoying Black people with his demonstration.Here is a video of Jack protesting. It appears the only people offended by his protest are Obama s US Park Police. You can see the initial encounter with the US Park police at the 10:28 mark:LIVE on #Periscope: Hillary Calls Blacks Superpredators At National African American Museum https://t.co/HGIS8zrcXV  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) September 24, 2016The audio is difficult to hear at times, but the Black officer demands to know why Posobiec is protesting. He answers he is not protesting but is (garbled.)The Black officer says,  You can do that anywhere. You can do that on You Tube. You can do that on Twitter. Why are you here?  Posobiec s response is garbled.The Black officer then demands,  Do you have any weapons on you?  More back and forth and then the Black officer takes the Hillary sign from Polosiec and puts it on the ground and then orders his hands raised and put on his head and then to turn around.As the Black officer starts to search Polosiec he focuses on the photographer filming and orders his officers to search the photographer saying,  You okay? You wanna check him out too cuz he s like doing all the filming. Let s make sure he doesn t have anything on him. The Black officer orders the camera being taken out of the photographer s hands so he can be  properly  searched.The camera continues filming at ground level while police search and interrogate the photographer who after a while appears to sit down. Prosobiec can be seen a few feet away sitting down on the sidewalk being detained by officers.After eight minutes of being detained the Black officer says to Polosiec,  You are perfectly within your rights but I d advise you to (garbled) but if you come back (garbled,)  The lecture is hard to hear, but the Black officer claims he doesn t care about Polosiec s politics and warns him that someone might (attack) him over the sign and the that he  wouldn t come back to save you. You re free to go. The Black officer then walks over to the photographer to repeat the lecture, saying  It is not a wise move to do it here, but you can do it here. (Garbled) coming back possibly to save you. Alright? You want to go the White House or Lafayette Park if you re under 25 people that s not a problem you can still make the same statement people feel comfortable This particular venue is not a wise place. But you can do, alright you re free to go, alright? Posobiec then starts speaking to the camera that there were numerous Black Lives Matter protesters around who were not being detained by police.Posobiec vows to continue his protest at the location.This writer was a prolific conservative activist with the Washington, D.C.chapter of FreeRepublic.com during the Clinton and Bush years and never witnessed or experienced any officer with federal or D.C. police agencies ask for ID or search a peaceful protester acting and dressed similarly to Prosobiec. The late FReeper Doctor Raoul Deming would wear masks and costumes to protest Bill and Hillary Clinton and was never searched or had ID demanded in D.C. over the course of hundreds of protests.In fact D.C. has some of the most lenient laws for protesters that allow spontaneous street demonstrations that block traffic where arrests can be made only after three prolonged warnings.Prosobiec was in a public place, not blocking traffic, and was not acting belligerent or threatening. He was exercising his First Amendment rights but as the officer implied because his audience was Black people, he should take his protest elsewhere like the White House of Lafayette Park (same thing, really, as a protest locale.)via: Gateway Pundit",1
" Trump Has Planted Spies To Ensure His Cabinet’s Loyalty – What He’s Calling Them Is TERRIFYING It s hard not to wonder just how paranoid and/or dictatorial Trump really is. One would think that, since he s the one appointing his cabinet, that he d be able to trust those secretaries to do their jobs according to how he wants them done. Apparently, though, that s not the case. Trump is so ridiculous that he s appointed many White House aides whose jobs are specifically to spy on the cabinet secretaries.All of these people have the title of  senior White House adviser,  and their offices are very close to their secretaries  offices. The point literally seems to be ensuring the cabinet secretaries  loyalty to Trump, seeing as how they report to the Office of Cabinet Affairs and not to the secretaries.But that s not all. That would be bad enough, but the White House has names for some of them that aren t  senior White House adviser.  For instance, the officer who s spying on General Mattis over at the Department of Defense is literally called  the commissar.  That s a reference to Soviet-era Communist Party officials whose task was just to ensure their commanders  loyalty.These people are embedded in every agency from the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services to the EPA, even to NASA. They are in constant contact with the White House.Obama, Bush and Clinton did not use this kind of spy method to ensure their cabinets did exactly as they were told.And that s nuts. But one former Trump adviser actually thinks this is smart, which just illustrates the level of paranoia and authoritarianism that has existed inside Trump s circles even before he was elected: Especially when you re starting a government and you have a changeover of parties when policies are going to be dramatically different, I think it s something that s smart. Somebody needs to be there as the White House s man on the scene. Because there s no senior staff yet, they re functioning as the White House s voice and ears in these departments. We guess the secretaries themselves just aren t good enough.The funny thing is that the Trump administration is all up in arms about  the deep state,  and the alleged  shadow government  that Obama s supposedly running to oppose Trump. Yet, they re creating their own shadow government with these  advisers  who are supposed to spy on leaders to make sure they remain properly loyal.If Trump can t trust even his own appointees to be loyal without spies like this, then he has no business running the U.S. government. But we already knew that, and this is just the latest thing to prove that Trump is trying to position himself as Supreme Overlord of the United States, or something.Featured image by Andrea Morales via Getty Images",0
"MN Taxpayers To Pay Rent For African Refugees While Visiting Homeland…Freeing Them From Financial Burden We re just wondering if the state of MN has ever considered giving US veterans the same consideration? Or is this an exclusive offer given to African refugees because they contribute so much to our economy or wait do they? In the USA, 91.4% of Muslim  refugees  are on food stamps and 68.3% are taking Cash Welfare. Here s a chart to show how much refugees are contributing to the overall economy. Via: Senator Jeff SessionsThe Minneapolis Housing Authority passed legislation this week that will allow migrants to skip their monthly rent in Minnesota when they travel back home to East Africa.The move was sought by local East African immigrants. Immigrants traveling for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship which will reduce their rent to $75 a month while they are gone. The Star Tribune reported:Public housing residents in Minneapolis will no longer need to pay their normal monthly rent when travel abroad erases their income, a change particularly sought by East African immigrants.The board of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority approved this week reverting to its previous policy of collecting only minimal rent during extended absences. The change takes effect once approved by federal housing officials, which is expected by year s end.Abdi Warsame, a City Council member, told the board that the policy in place for the past five years works a particular hardship on elderly East Africans who must save for long periods if they want to visit their homelands. He said that many receive federal Supplemental Security Income, which is halted when the recipient is outside the United States.Yet the policy required people to keep paying rent, which is income-based. Travelers gone for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship, which meant that they paid the minimum $75 monthly rent during their absence, but were required to make up the difference between that and their normal rent over the next year or two.

"Exposed: The US is an Oligarchy Ruled by Billionaires and Dictators  Eric Zuesse Off GuardianEven for the post of U.S. President, the preferences of the American people have only a marginal, if any, impact upon the selection of the person to occupy that post.In Colorado s Republican race to win delegates to the Republican National Convention for selecting the Republican Presidential nominee, there was no primary, and there was no caucus.As the Republican magazine National Review headlined on April 11th, attempting to justify what a Republican wag had just headlined as  Cruz Celebrates Voterless Win : Donald Trump Laid a Colorado Goose Egg because He Was Disorganized and Amateurish. Their argument (since they campaign for any Republican but Trump) was: he lost  because he was disorganized and amateurish  not because he had been cheated by the Party-hierarchy.National Review explained that in the process which had been set up by the Colorado Republican Party (it s set up by each individual state s Republican Party, not by the National Republican Party),  delegates to the national convention would be selected at congressional-district conventions and the Republican s [sic] state convention , and this was done in order to give Colorado s delegates more flexibility,  not done in order to require delegates to reflect the Republican (or any other) electorate in Colorado (since NR doesn t like even its own Party s electorate).This was the explanation that was provided by that magazine, which backs Cruz, and which has been campaigning ferociously against Trump.  Their article was built upon, and extensively quoted, the justifications put forth by one particular Cruz delegate, who said, The grassroots made the decision that Ted Cruz was the best candidate for us, and the grassroots made the decision to come out for Cruz and absolutely swept the table. He called it  our caucus system.  Whatever it was, it shut out all rank-and-file Republican voters, and left everything to people like himself, who could afford to do this: You have to put in the work, you have to put in the effort, and you have to do it months ahead of time. In other words: only Republican Party activists in Colorado could participate in selecting the delegates who would participate in selecting the Republican nominee. No one else was allowed to.  Their conception of the Colorado Republican Party is that it s only the Party s activists; and, if you re not a Republican activist, you have no say.It s as if to say:Only people who work in the government can have a say in how the government is to be run.  It s for insiders only and, of course, indirectly it s for whomever pays those insiders and so enables them to  put in the work  to participate.National Public Radio had a different take on this matter.  Steve Inskeep headlined there GOP Delegate: Trump Primary Wins  Absolutely Irrelevant  At Convention.  He interviewed Curly Haughland, a member of the Republican National Committee who lives in North Dakota, and who said: No matter what the popular belief might be,   there is no connection between primaries and the actual convention. Well, that s putting it rather bluntly. Haughland also said: Cited the GOP s convention Rules 37 and 38. He interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may  vote their conscience.  The rules do not explicitly say this. Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll-call votes. However, Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be  bound  by the  unit rule, meaning that delegates from a state can t all be forced to vote the same way. Another of Haughland s points is indisputable: When the convention convenes,  he said,  the delegates adopt their own rules, which haven t been adopted yet.  There is a standard template for conventions, but delegates could tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. In other words: the National Republican Committee says that all of the delegates to the Republican National Convention are allowed to  tweak the template, changing the game in any way that they want. So: the delegates at that Convention won t actually be representing anyone but themselves there. They are entirely free to push for anyone whom they personally want to win the Republican U.S. Presidential nomination.They re not bound, not even on the first ballot. They might pretend to be, if they feel a need to put on a show that looks  democratic , but any who don t feel the need to make such a pretense, can do whatever they want on the first ballot, just like on any successive ballot. They are free; all of them are free. It s only the electorate who aren t   they re not represented, at all.What about on the Democratic side?  Wyoming had held its Democratic Party caucuses on April 9, and there really were caucuses.  Two days later, CNN headlined Wyoming Democratic Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Picks Up Another Win , and reported: Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses Saturday, providing his campaign with one more jolt of momentum before the race against Hillary Clinton heads east. Even so, he made no gains in Clinton s delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result.    On April 12th a youtube video was posted, MSNBC Morning Host Admits The  Whole Voting System Is Rigged  After Bernie Get s Cheated! Here the co-hosts had a conversation about the results:  Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by twelve points, 56 to 44,   He wins by twelve points.  The accompanying image showed the delegate-count, in this contest that Sanders had won by 56% to 44%:  18 total.  Hillary Clinton 11, Bernie Sanders 7.  It wasn t 7 to 7, after all.Though Sanders had outscored Clinton by 12%, it was worse than even-steven for him; he had actually lost by 11 delegates to 7 delegates.  This system is so rigged!  said one host.  There s absolutely no reason any of those people voted,  said the other.A Hillary Clinton supporter was the  expert  on the panel, and he said,  It s not rigged. These are the rules.  He wasn t given time to explain that fine point   or how  the rules  were necessarily  not rigged. Also on April 12th, Public Radio International s Todd Zwillich headlined (falsely), Six Reasons Bernie Sanders Won Wyoming, But Still Tied in the Delegate Race , and Zwillig failed to explain that word  Tied.  He opened:  How, many of you ask, could Bernie have won Wyoming 56 percent to Hillary s 44 percent, but still split the delegates with her 50-50?  Then, he repeated that there had supposedly been  The 7-7 split,  but he also said  Wyoming has a total of 18 delegates  (which obviously isn tthe sum of 7+7) and he was also likewise incoherent, all the way through.Maybe  the rules  in the Wyoming Democratic Party are like that; but, whatever they are, is so convoluted, America s news-media couldn t explain what they were, much less were they able to argue persuasively that this was somehow a democracy.The only thing that s clear is that the electoral system in the United States is so convoluted, so complex and so different from state to state and party to party, that whatever the intent of the writers of America s Constitution might have been, the system as it is today, can be successfully gamed and won only by interests who can afford to spend whatever billions of dollars are necessary in order to win. It s certainly anything but democratic.Right now, according to RealClear Politics, there are only two Presidential candidates who are shown repeatedly, and almost consistently, to be preferred by the majority of the U.S. electorate: the Democrat Bernie Sanders is strongly preferred over the Republicans Trump and Cruz, and he is barely preferred over the Republican Kasich; and the Republican Kasich is strongly preferred over the Democrat Clinton.  (Clinton loses strongly to Kasich and barely beats Cruz, while Trump is the weakest general-election candidate of all.)The strongest general-election candidates are, clearly, Sanders in the Democratic Party, and Kasich in the Republican Party. In a democracy, those would be the candidates. Throughout the contest thus far, neither of these two has been favored likely to win his respective Party s nomination, much less the Presidency.Whatever America is, it isn t a democracy   a one-person-one-vote majority-rule republic. In fact, the only scientific study that has ever been done of the U.S. political system, finds that it s no  democracy  at all, but instead an  oligarchy, a nation ruled by its aristocracy, its billionaires.It represents them, not the citizenry. That might not be the theory, but empirically it is the fact. An oligarchy is the commonest type of dictatorship, and it certainly is never a  benevolent dictatorship,  even if that phrase is not an oxymoron in itself.To sum up: the U.S. is ruled by and for the corrupters. It has been like that since at least 1980.***Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author, most recently, of  They re Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records, 1910-2010, and of  CHRIST S VENTRILOQUISTS: The Event that Created Christianity.READ MORE US ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",1
" Conservative Convicted Of Trying To Assassinate Obama With A Slingshot — Yes, A Slingshot (SCREENSHOTS) A Wisconsin man who believed it to be his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY  to kill the President was convicted last week of two counts of threatening Barack Obama. After four hours of deliberations, a jury of seven men and five women found 55-year-old Brian Dennis Dutcher guilty of writing a Facebook comment about assassinating the President upon learning of an upcoming visit, and of telling a security guard he would shoot Obama the day before POTUS  arrival in Tomah.In comments under a Facebook post in which he informed people that  all members of the fed gov have targets on their foreheads,  and that they should be shot on sight, Dutcher gleefully remarked that  the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip.  Dutcher explained that he planned to kill the President so his daughter can  live free. That s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president,  he said in another post that was deleted before we had a chance to snag a screenshot in June.  Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! In numerous other posts, Dutcher discussed killing the President, even expressing a desire for the Secret Service to  step out of the way long enough for someone    like him    to take the shot  so the President could be  exucuted.   Dutcher also said that he had a stockpile of fully automatic weapons and ammunitions, as well as plastic explosives, mortars, and other things that would make any NRA member s pants tighten a bit.With all that heavy equipment, it was shocking that Dutcher was arrested with After Tough Guy s arrest on July 2, Dutcher told Secret Service that he meant what he said, and he absolutely intended to use the slingshot to kill the  usurper. Dutch  was detained for 24 hours at a mental health facility in La Crosse, where he threatened the staff and accused them of   helping the tyrant.  He was then moved to Dane County Jail. He said he was very accurate with a slingshot,  Secret Service Special Agent Jeffrey Ferris testified.  His true intention was to circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher told police that he had hunted animals with the slingshot and that he could kill a human with it. He also referenced the Biblical story of David and Goliath, with Obama apparently being the latter in the tale.Dennis the Menace Dutcher is due to be sentenced for his crimes in March. He faces up to five years in prison for each count, so he may have a long time to sit in the corner and think about what he did.Featured image via Wisconsin State Journal/Wikimedia Commons",1

" Fmr. DNI James Clapper: Trump’s Russia Scandal Is Worse Than Watergate (VIDEO) James Clapper was the Director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration. He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is. No, this is far, far worse than Watergate, and that is why we must find a way to remove the entire Trump Administration from office as soon as possible.Watch Clapper s remarks below:Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",1

"Georgia Teachers Fired for Pro-Trump Comments The DeKalb County Georgia School Superintendent, Stephen Green, has issued a warning to all teachers against making statements in support of President Donald Trump or his policies.  Since the warning was given, two teachers have already been forced to tender their resignation.Via World Net Daily: Green is now taking it a step further, warning teachers not to inject their personal beliefs into the classroom if they line up with those of the president of the United States.Green told a local newspaper, the Champion, that his Jan. 30 statement sought to grant students assurance that DeKalb County Schools officials remain committed to being  culturally responsive, diverse and supportive  of DeKalb County s immigrant population. Our schools will be safe places for learning and teaching,  he wrote in the statement.  We will not tolerate any form of bullying or discrimination on or off district property that interferes with learning or the rights of others.

"NUTTY LEFTY Breaks Into TRUMP’S Mar-A-Lago Club…Vandalizes With Bananas PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)   A woman is being charged with sneaking onto President Donald Trump s private Mar-a-Lago club shortly before his inauguration and smearing bananas on cars.Palm Beach, Florida, police say in a report released Monday that 48-year-old Kelly Weidman also typed a profanity about Trump on a Mar-a-Lago computer and moved outside some ballroom balloons a few hours before Trump was sworn-in Friday.She was confronted by security guards, who called police. She allegedly told officers she wanted to be arrested because no one was paying attention to her claim of being cyber attacked. She was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and released.Because Trump wasn t at the ritzy club, the Secret Service wasn t involved.No one answered a phone number listed for Weidman on Monday and court records didn t list an attorney.VIA: WPTV",0
"WATCH: CHEROKEE PEOPLE Express Disgust Over “Lying” Elizabeth Warren Faking “Native American Heritage” To Get Prestigious Law Professor Job Oh look Hillary s considering a lying, opportunist, Democrat politician with a vagina as her running mate. It all makes perfect sense if you consider that Hillary s thinking ahead, and that if anything happened to her she wants to make sure she has someone with the same morals and ethics to fill her corrupt shoes In Warren s book  A Fighting Chance,  Massachusetts Democratic senator and potential vice presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite history regarding the controversy surrounding her  Native American  ancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What s remarkable is that, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to get away with it. In fact, it s virtually ignored that to this day Warren still refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this controversy.To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her claims of Native American heritage, which is true. The larger and unaddressed issue, however, is whether or not Warren falsely claimed minority status in order to gain an unfair advantage in her academic career. This was a question that was unresolved at the end of the 2012 campaign and it remains unresolved with the publication of Warren s book.Watch Cherokee people from ND tell how they feel about Lying Elizabeth using phony  Native American  status to gain an advantage in obtaining a job:First, what s perhaps most notable about Warren s book is that she even includes a section called  Native American,  in which she reportedly writes,  Everyone on our mother s side   aunts, uncles, and grandparents   talked openly about their Native American ancestry. My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents  courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory. This is ironic because, until the Boston Herald first broke the news in April 2012 that Harvard Law School had repeatedly promoted Warren as a Native American faculty member, Warren never once mentioned these stories of her upbringing in a single press interview, speech, class lecture or testimony at any point, ever, in her decades-long career. What s more, Warren was not listed as a minority on her transcript from George Washington University where she began her undergraduate education, nor did she list herself as a minority when applying to Rutgers University Law School in 1973.In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage. It s important to note that entrance and advancement in the law school profession is governed by the Association of American Law Schools, which requires registrants interested in teaching at law schools to fill out a questionnaire detailing their education, experience, bar passage and, yes, ethnicity. This information is then disseminated to law schools around the country that, as Warren surely knew, are always on the lookout to add to the diversity of their faculty.A copy of Warren s questionnaire currently resides in the Association of American Law Schools archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, only Warren herself has the authority to release the complete copy of her questionnaire and to date, she has refused to do so.Watch Warren stonewalling the press over her phony  Native American  status and double down on her refusal to clear the record and release the copy of her questionnaire: Her opposition to such transparency can perhaps be understood in the documented fact that in the years thereafter, starting in 1986, Warren began self-reporting herself as a  minority professor  in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory that lists all law school professors around the country. As the former association chairman told the Boston Herald, the directory once served a tip sheet for law school administrators, in the pre-Internet days, who were looking to identify and recruit minority professors.Remarkably, Warren s explanation to the Boston Herald was that she listed herself as a minority in the hopes that she would be invited to a luncheon so she could meet  people who are like I am  and she stopped checking the box when that didn t happen. Perhaps it  didn t happen  because at no point, at any of the schools she attended or worked at, is there any evidence that Warren ever joined any Native American organizations on campus or in any way interacted with anyone in the Native American community.That did not however, stop Warren from continuing to self-report as a Native American minority. The New York Times reported in May 2012 that Warren was listed as a minority recipient of a teaching award years earlier at the University of Pennsylvania where she had advanced after teaching at several non-Ivy League law schools. Notably, Penn declined to explain to the Times why Warren was listed as a minority.From Penn, Warren moved on to Harvard Law School, where her Native American heritage was touted in multiple articles, including a Fordham Law Review piece that lauded her as Harvard Law s   first woman of color.  Even as recently as 2011, it appears Warren was listed as the lone Native American faculty member on the school s 2011  diversity report,  though like Penn, Harvard also refused to comment.Yet, when the Herald first broke the story in April 2012, Warren claimed she  had no idea  that Harvard had touted her Native American status and claimed she did not  recall  ever citing her Native American heritage when applying for a job. In the months afterward, Warren ducked, dodged and stonewalled subsequent questions, eventually wearing-out the press, and succeeded in winning an election without ever releasing any records that might substantiate those claims.Whether Warren falsely claimed to be a minority in order to game the system and advance her career is a question that goes to the heart of her honesty and integrity. It s also a question that will confront her if she ever seeks higher office. Via: US News",0
" WATCH: Pelosi Knows The Russians Have Something HUGE on Trump and He’ll Do Anything To Keep It Quiet So many questions have come up in the wake of James Comey s Senate testimony. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is again asking the harsh but necessary question,  What do the Russians have on Donald Trump? Pretty much everyone is in agreement that Thursday s testimony by James Comey was totally devastating for Trump. Even Trump s buddies over at Fox News are admitting it was  very damaging for the president. By far the most incriminating statement made by Comey was that he couldn t  remember any conversations with the president about the Russia election. The fact the Russia attempted to control the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is indisputable at this point. What s curious is that Trump had no interest in the fact that our democracy was attacked and how we remain susceptible to attacks in the future.This total lack of concern for foreign election hijack prompted Pelsoi in a press conference on Friday to ask some critical questions. So again I ask the question, What do the Russians have on Donald Trump   politically, personally, or financially   that he just won t go to that place and instead enshrines them, sings and dances to their tune. And Republicans in Congress have been resistant to finding it   have resisted finding out the truth. So I think there are other remedies that we can exhaust. I respect the opinion of those who think he should come. But I think we   if the Republicans in Congress would be more, shall we say, open to facts and the truth, we can learn a lot without the president coming here. Comey warned us on Thursday,  They re coming after America.  Why does that not concern or pique any interest from the president?

"TRUMP SOUNDED LIKE A CHOIR BOY Next To Hillary’s Foul-Mouthed, Abusive Rants: “Where’s the miserable c*ck sucker?”…and MORE Hillary Clinton has a long history of violence and abusing and men, women and security officers.Of course, you ll never see any of these quotes from the condescending former  First Witch  in the mainstream media, but that doesn t mean they didn t happen. Hillary has a reputation for having a vulgar potty mouth and a nasty disposition. Wouldn t it be nice if the GOP  leaders  cared as much about her negatives as an 11 year old Trump story.Here are a few of her more memorable lines: Where is the G-damn f**king flag? I want the G-damn f**king flag up every f**king morning at f**king sunrise.

"DEMOCRAT MOCKS AMERICANS For Believing ‘Climate Change’ Is Part Of Obamatrade: Two Weeks Later…Obama Announces ‘Climate Change’ Is Part of Obamatrade Not that it matters, but since it appears that no one has read the bill, it s probably not that unlikely that Democrat senator Ron Wyden misspoke In a speech on the Senate floor on May 22, Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon ridiculed those who thought climate change regulation would be part of Obamatrade:We ve heard suggested, for example, that it s a backdoor route to immigration reform or action on climate change . My sense is that the rate these hypotheticals are going, you re bound to hear that a future president working on a trade deal might have second thoughts about the Louisiana purchase.But in an interview on NPR s Marketplace yesterday (June 3), President Obama said that enforcing climate change regulations will indeed be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obamatrade pact that he is currently negotiating with Malaysia and 10 other countries. He said:If we want to solve something like climate change, which is one of my highest priorities, then I ve got to be able to get into places like Malaysia, and say to them, this is in your interest. What leverage do I have to get them to stop deforestation? Well part of the leverage is if I m in a trade relationship with them that allows me to raise standards.In December, Obama will negotiate a multi-country climate agreement in Paris. We already know from Obama s joint announcement with China that he will commit the United States to a huge reduction in carbon emissions of 26%-28% from 2005 levels, but he will let China, already a much larger carbon emitter, continue to expand its carbon emissions until 2030.Via: American Thinker",0
" Trump Is Building Literal, Actual Concentration Camps For Undocumented Immigrants It s beginning. While some dismissed Donald Trump s campaign promises to ban Muslims from entering the country, dismantle our country s healthcare, build a giant goddamn motherfucking wall to keep brown people from entering the country, and every other horrific thing you can think of and more as  just words  he was using to get stupid people to vote for him, he meant every single one of them   and he s been proving it.One of President Asterisk s first acts was an executive order that is the beginning of his efforts to dismantle Obamacare. He followed up by signing away our environment and authorizing the building of two controversial pipelines, stripping federal funds from international health organizations that so much as mention abortion (in an order conveniently following millions of women lining the streets to protest him). He then withdrew us from a major trade agreement without a single thought about the repercussions, began funneling our tax dollars into his stupid wall, ordered a weekly report on crimes committed by  aliens  and banned Muslims from seven countries he hates from entering the country.Trump even authorized the building of new camps in which undocumented immigrants could be concentrated   for a limited time, of course   until they could be deported (I feel like there s a term for these things, but I can t quite place it). The Washington Post reports: The presidential directives signed Wednesday aim to create more detention centers, add thousands of Border Patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws. One order calls for the  immediate construction of a physical wall. In short, if you re a member of this group that Trump considers undesirable, you ll be sent to one of these camps and any city that might otherwise harbor you will face extreme penalties for doing so. We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,  Trump told a crowd of DHS employees Wednesday.  Beginning today, the United States gets control of its borders. Trump also vowed to investigate alleged voter fraud in blue states   particularly in  urban  (that s right-wing slang for  black ) areas   so he can prove once and forgodamnall that he actually won the popular vote, because he really is that petty.It hasn t even been a week since Trump took office and he has already made it clear that he has declared war on the American people. The question remains: just how much are we going to take of this bullshit?Make no mistake about it: people will die in Trump s camps and his supporters will applaud.This. Is. Not. OK.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",1

"OOPS! #DEPLORABLE HILLARY JUST GOT BUSTED Offending Half Of Her Base: Called Bernie Sanders Supporters Basement Dwellers [VIDEO] First, Hillary offended half of America when she called them a  basket full of deplorables :Hello #BasementDwellers, you aren't the only ones Hillary has categorized and demonized. #BasketOfDeplorables pic.twitter.com/EOIhfmyWXt  Asa J   (@asamjulian) October 1, 2016Now she s offended half of the Democrat base with this latest video that has been uncovered.An audio recording has surfaced, revealing Hillary Clinton speaking critically about young voters supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), saying they ve bought into a  false promise.   It s a false promise,  Clinton says in the recording, referencing Sanders  political revolution.  But I don t think you tell idealistic people   particularly young people   that they ve bought into a false promise. The audio, which was released by the Washington Free Beacon, comes just three weeks after Clinton faced backlash for calling millions of Americans supporting Donald Trump  deplorables. The recording, which is from a fundraising event in February, catches the Democratic nominee calling Sanders  supporters  children of the Great Recession  that are  living in their parents  basement. There is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates,  Clinton states.Watch:Via: Breitbart News",0
" Bill Maher: Trump’s Orlando Massacre Response Shows America ‘What He Is – A Narcissist’ (VIDEO) Donald Trump s response to the horrific massacre in Orlando   the worst in American history   was nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of expressing condolences, he instead congratulated himself on being right about Muslims and used the tragedy as an opportunity to double down on his bigoted plan to ban Muslims from the United States. HBO s host of Real Time, Bill Maher, wasted no time in ripping Trump a new one on that, and took it a step further and told his viewers what we all already know: Donald Trump is not just an offensive blowhard, he s also an amazing narcissist. Maher began with Trump s racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is  presiding over his Trump University case: The judge thing looked selfish. There is no constituency for Trump University except for Donald Trump. And then the first thing out of his mouth after Orlando was,  I was right.  He looks like what he is   a narcissist. One of Maher s panel members, Business Insider Senior Editor Josh Barro, pointed out that the American people have shown better sense than we realize  when it comes to Trump s ridiculously offensive Twitter brag regarding Orlando. He continued: It turns out Americans don t like blatantly racist attacks on the judiciary that also signal that a president might use his own power to support his businesses and defeat his political opponents through untoward things. And then the response to the shooting. I think there had been this idea that if there was terrorism that it would be good for Trump. Bill Maher went so far as to say that this week ended Trump s White House ambitions: I see it as, this was the week it ended. I don t think I m the only one, because most of the Republicans who were caught on camera this week basically said,  I don t want to talk about it. Of course they don t want to talk about it. What the hell can they say to what Trump gets up to at his rallies and on national television on an almost daily basis? Hell, the man even celebrated his 70th birthday this week by accusing the sitting president of treason. The Republicans who do speak out are the brave ones, such as the former Bush adviser who called him out for what he is   ignorant   after those remarks that suggest that President Obama was a terrorist sympathizer.Hopefully, Maher is right, and this particularly horrible week in Trump Land has effectively squashed any chance he has at ruining America as President Trump.Watch the clip below, via Raw Story:https://youtu.be/nS3Uv8OVC3IFeatured image via video screen capture",0
"PRESIDENT TRUMP’S Illegal Immigrant Crackdown Begins…Feds Conduct Raids In At Least 6 States With Focus On Finding And Deporting Criminals [VIDEO] U.S. immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least a half-dozen states this week in a series of raids that marked the first large-scale enforcement of President Trump s Jan. 26 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.The raids, which officials said targeted known criminals, also netted some immigrants who did not have criminal records, an apparent departure from similar enforcement waves during the Obama administration that aimed to just corral and deport those who had committed crimes.Trump has pledged to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Last month he also made a change to the Obama administration s policy of prioritizing deportation for convicted criminals, substantially broadening the scope of who the Department of Homeland Security can target, to include those with only minor offenses or those with no convictions at all.Immigration officials confirmed that agents this week raided homes and workplaces in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, the Los Angeles area, North Carolina and South Carolina, netting hundreds of people. But Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said they were part of  routine  immigration enforcement actions.

" Newt Gingrich Just SLAMMED Romney, Dubya And His Daddy For Being Hypocrites And Babies (VIDEO) The actors and actresses of Fox News have received their marching orders and the run to November will officially be the propaganda machine for Donald Trump. That s how it seems, at least, as hosts align themselves with people like Newt Gingrich, and other hard-core party liners who will vote for whomever has an (R) next to their name. Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want, he turned his attention to the two former presidents, George W. and George H.W. Bush. Both of those historical failures have decided that they refuse to support Donald Trump, and nor will they attend the convention to initiate the Fourth Reich. Little brother Jeb has also chimed in that he ll be on the sidelines as well, as though he had a choice. Jeb was Trump s first real target. When it worked and Jeb dropped out, pundits everywhere were shocked. Then one by one they fell. All of the party elite; all of the establishment favorites.The money from the Koch brothers never appeared, because as evil as they are, they aren t stupid. Donald Trump ran the most effective underdog campaign in history by loaning himself money and going out and getting free press. Trump used the Republican Party and the agenda of fear and hate they ve fostered for far too long against them like a champ. The uneducated bigots crawled out of the woodwork to demand the country be great again and (insert required amount of rhetoric and lies).As the stupidity gained steam and made its way towards a downhill run to Cleveland, the party began to fracture. The pledge they made Trump sign now makes them look like massive hypocrites. What they re left with are fights of the magnitude of Gingrich versus Bush:Gingrich: ""When [HW, W & Romney] were the nominees they expected all of us to support them."" https://t.co/0dzSQiMZjfhttps://t.co/7cYf30HPLf  Fox News (@FoxNews) May 7, 2016Congratulations, GOP.

" WATCH: Joy Reid OWNS Trump In Less Than 30 Seconds For Claiming To Be More Popular Than Obama Joy Reid rained on Donald Trump s parade on Sunday morning, and it was glorious.Earlier in the morning, Trump declared on Twitter that his poll numbers are better than President Obama s and posted about how Rasmussen, a conservative leaning polling firm, has his approval rating at 50 percent.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That s higher than O s # s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017Well, AM Joy host Joy Reid quickly destroyed Trump with a smile and some snark. Trump also tweeted about his poll numbers this morning, citing a new poll that puts his approval rating at 50 percent and saying that s higher than O s numbers,  Reid said before pointing out that Trump is obsessed with Obama.  Obsessed with President Obama much?  she continued.Reid then noted that other polls have Trump s approval rating much lower than Rasmussen. In fact, his rating is the lowest in history. The only poll showing Trump at 50 percent was Rasmussen, which Reid trashed. See if you can spot the outlier,  she asked the audience.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald had better see someone quickly about that burn.But it s even worse for him because his claim is not even close to being accurate. As it turns out, President Obama s approval rating on June 18, 2009 was 55 percent. And the polling firm that reported that finding happens to be Rasmussen, the same polling firm Trump is bragging about now. And last time I checked, 55 is still bigger than 50. That means Trump s claim that he has a higher number than Obama is totally false.Reid is right about Trump being obsessed with President Obama. Trump has tried to destroy Obama s legacy at every turn and he is constantly claiming to be a better president even though he has been a complete disaster for this country. Trump legislative record is laughable since the only bills he signs are minor ones that designate buildings and other little things that don t really matter. He has not signed a single piece of major legislation yet, and he is been in office over 100 days already.Mostly, he has been signing executive orders, which Trump and conservatives repeated whined about Obama doing. Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than Obama ever did. Furthermore, Trump is also on pace to take more vacation days and play more rounds of golf in a single year than Obama ever did.Trump is an embarrassment to this nation and his poll numbers are only going to get worse once his supporters begin to truly realize that they have been duped.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
" With Just One Phone Call, Trump SHATTERS Our Relationship With China Trump s brazen phone calls to various world leaders are upsetting diplomats, and with good reason. He s voicing admiration for some of the worst dictators in the world, such as the leader of Kazakhstan, and he wants to visit Pakistan. He also ruffled feathers in some circles when he issued a casual, offhand invitation to Britain s prime minister, Theresa May, following phone calls to nine other world leaders.His most recent phone call was to Taiwan, a country with which the U.S. has had no contact for nearly 40 years. In doing so, he may have upset the delicate balance that currently exists between us and China, because China thinks of Taiwan as a  renegade province. Okay, so China isn t a country that we re totally in love with right now. The problem with Trump doing this, though, is that China is still a trading partner, and if he wishes to be able to negotiate a better trade deal with them, he d do well to respect them and the delicate nature of our relationship with them right now.But all Trump has proven thus far is that he s an idiotic, ill-prepared, complete dolt when it comes to handling the presidency, and especially foreign relations. There things he doesn t even know to think about before calling absolutely everyone on the planet. White House press secretary Josh Earnest actually begged Trump to go through proper channels, meaning the Department of State, when contacting world leaders.Otherwise, his willy-nilly phone calls like this can shake up, or even destroy, relationships that are already on shaky ground.Like our relationship with China.He certainly didn t try to make a friend out of China during his campaign, blasting them repeatedly for stealing our jobs and essentially saying he was going to strongarm them into a trade agreement that was more favorable to us. And now Beijing would actually be right if they were pissed at him for this.Trump needs finesse. He needs discretion. He needs a shit-ton of help here. He s going to destroy all of our alliances before he even takes office this way.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",1
" Donald Trump Throws MASSIVE Hissy Fit Over Hillary’s Speech And DNC Convention Hillary Clinton delivered an amazing speech on Thursday night and the DNC Convention was a unifying success, so of course Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum about it. Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?  the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division. Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us   from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He s taken the Republican Party a long way  from  Morning in America  to  Midnight in America.  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night. He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen. But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016And then he threw a broader tantrum.Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Hillary s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Hillary s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016It should be pointed out that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were not  Hillary s wars.  They were George W. Bush s wars. No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton   corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Then Trump picked up where he left off and continued his hissy fit.The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and  forgot  to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 @AnnCoulter:  I believe in science  Dem code for  we re shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016  Little  Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn t get 10% of the vote   they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary said that I  couldn t handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign.  Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Again, this is who the Republican Party actually thinks is qualified to be the leader of the free world. How will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on Twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him? And keep in mind that Trump only has Twitter to attack people with. As president, he would have the military, drones, and nuclear weapons at his disposal. How can anyone feel safe with Trump as president when he has such a thin skin that he could start a war at any time just because another nation insulted him?Featured Image: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",1
"CHRISTIAN HIGH SCHOOL Told By State They Are No Longer Allowed To Pray Before Games The drip drip drip of communism Leftists are stealing our rights and freedom while Americans can t be bothered with  politics  because they re too busy watching the Kardashians The Florida High School Athletics Association recently denied a request by two Christian schools to broadcast a prayer before a championship game at Orlando s Citrus Bowl Stadium.Cambridge Christian School in Tampa and the University Christian School out of Jacksonville are playing in the District 2-A high school football championships today and coaches from both teams submitted a request to ensure a 30-second prayer over the loudspeaker before kickoff, Bay News 9 reports.But Roger Dearing, director of the Florida High School Athletics Association, denied the request for two main reasons. The facility is a public facility, predominantly paid for with public tax dollars, makes the facility  off limits  under federal guidelines and precedent court cases,  Dearing wrote in an emailed response to the teams.  In Florida Statutes, the FHSAA (host and coordinator of the event) is legally a  State Actor,  we cannot legally permit or grant permission for such an activity. Cambridge head of school Tim Euler doesn t agree with Dearing s ruling. We ve played 13 football games this year,  he told Bay News 9  We ve prayed before every one of them. Here s the problem,  Euler told WTSP.  The Florida Legislature is opened up with prayer in a building that is paid by tax dollars. What is the difference? If they can pray there, we can pray here, and I want them to be able to pray there and I want us to be able to pray here,  he added.  So I think (Dearing s) reasoning is flawed at the core of it. Euler said Friday morning, hours before the game s 1 p.m. start time, that it s unlikely the teams would be able to reverse the decision, but believes it s important to highlight the problem, nonetheless. What we really want to do is raise awareness,  he told Bay News 9.  All we re asking for is an opportunity for two Christian schools to pray. WTSP attempted to contact the Florida High School Athletic Association about the ruling, but the agency ignored its request.WTSP reporter Mike Deeson posted about the controversy on Facebook. I was disappointed the Florida High School Athletic Association didn t return our calls,  he wrote.  I wanted to know how the legislature opens with a prayer in a taxpayer owned building with state employees, yet FHSAA maintains a prayer couldn t be said in a taxpayer funding facility the Citrus Bow that was sanctioned by state employees, members of FHSAA. Something doesn t make sense when you compare the two   but they NEVER returned our calls,  Deeson posted.  In my opinion that was a BAD PR MOVE! Readers, of course, were enraged by the FHSAA s decision. I think it s absolutely ridiculous that they will not let two Christian schools pray before their game,  Mary Salvatore posted to Facebook.  And you wonder why we have so many mass shootings across the country! So PC and so tolerant that you become intolerant,  Robert Rosengarten added.  Let them pray, who gives a f. If they want to pray to Jesus, Allah, the flying spaghetti monster, let them, who cares. Who s to stop them?  Daniel Suarez questioned.  What if both teams come together before the game and pray? What if all in the stands begin to pray? Who would it hurt?  Via: EAG News",0
"YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHO DEFEATED A BILL IN JUNE TO ARM OUR SOLDIERS AT RECRUITING CENTERS AND BASES Even though he s a RINO THIS is a shocker! In June, Nevada s Republican Sen. Dean Heller tried to get the Pentagon to change its practice of banning arms from our soldiers on bases and in recruiting centers here in America. Unfortunately for our soldiers, John McCain was the principle foe of the move and helped to defeat the arming of our soldiers, a decision that recently had deadly consequences in Tennessee. Last week Nebraska Senator Dean Heller appeared spoke to radio host Kevin Wall on KKFT AM in Carson City, NV, to talk about his amendment and noted that John McCain himself defeated the move to arm our soldiers.Here is a transcript of what Heller to the radio station: Dean Heller:  So I submitted an amendment in the Department of Defense Authorization bill to allow this to happen. Now this was of course six weeks ago before Chattanooga. And the chairman of the committee wouldn t support it by the way, chairman was John McCain did not want the amendment as part of the bill and wouldn t accept it. Here is what Heller said on his website about the bill: Today, U.S. Senator Dean Heller sent a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, requesting that National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conferees include his amendment to give military base commanders the authority to allow service members to carry personal firearms on base for their personal protection and force protection. In June, Senator Heller offered this amendment during the Senate s consideration of the Fiscal Year 2016 NDAA. In addition, Senator Heller introduced stand-alone legislation to address this issue critical to the safety of our nation s service members. John McCain made sure that the Marines who died in Chattanooga and all their brethren would not be able to fire back and save lives when a terrorist attacked. How s THAT from a  war hero ? Granted, even if the amendment had been included in the Pentagon budget bill and passed, it isn t too likely that the change would have been made quickly enough to have allowed the Marines in Tennessee to protect themselves against an ISIS terrorist s rampage. But that isn t the point, here. The point is McCain saw no reason to even allow them to be able to defend themselves. In the terror attacks on the two Chattanooga recruiting facilities we now see just how wrong McCain is.Via: publiusforum",0
" Tamir Rice’s Memorial Is A Stop In Pokemon Go And It Has A Powerful Message The gazebo at the Cudell Recreation Center in Cleveland, Ohio has become a non-official memorial for Tamir Rice, an innocent 12-year-old who was shot and killed by the police. The gazebo is the location where Rice was killed while playing with a toy rifle.According to Belt Magazine, the location has also recently become a popular stop in the smash hit augmented reality game, Pok mon Go. For those not familiar how the game works, locations of interest   called Pokestops   such as public works of art, historical locations, and other community hot spots.The person who suggested the location be added as a location in the game developer s database took the opportunity to make a statement. The description for the pokestop reads: Community memorial for Tamir Rice, shot and killed by CPD officers who shot him in under 2s after breaking department policy regarding escalation of force. The Cudell Gazebo bears no marker indicating that is a memorial for Rice. The gazebo was scheduled to be demolished though it has not due to certain groups who wish to see the area preserved as a historical landmark. As of right now, the gazebo has remained in a state of limbo. So, besides the stuffed animals and other tokens left by community members, there is no way to tell what the historical importance of what the location is.This virtual marker runs contrary to the findings of a grand jury who decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the shooting.A commentator on the Belt claims to be the person who wrote the description for the Gazebo. He claims that he wrote the description not thinking that it would be noticed by many people, as it was added to a much less popular game created by the same company who created Pokemon Go. He writes that he wrote the description because: Memorials are built in the hope people will remember. The events that ended Tamir Rice s life are something that I worry will be forgotten. It was difficult to see the gazebo pictured without context, and I added a bit without expecting it to be noticed by anyone else. The gazebo in the park should be turned into an official memorial for Rice. However, even if it was the spot would not tell the story that so many people hear. It is nice to know that there are people able to get what many would consider the truth of the story of what happened at that spot than what is on the official record.Featured image from Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0
" Shortly Before Her Death, Nancy Reagan Said She Was Ashamed Of The GOP (VIDEO) On Sunday, the nation learned that former first lady Nancy Reagan, 94, had passed away at her Los Angeles home from congestive heart failure. Nancy was the wife of Republican hero Ronald Reagan and after his death in 2004, she became an outspoken activist for a cure Alzheimer s disease and huge beacon of support for families whose loved ones suffered from the degenerative illness. While Republican presidential candidates have expressed grief over her passing, her longtime friend, Larry King, said he is relieved that she will not be here to see the end of the GOP s disgusting presidential race.During an interview with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, King said: I ll miss her. I love socializing with her, I love gossiping with her, I love talking with her. If there s one thing glad about this,  he added.  She isn t around to see the end of this political year. Because she was very upset by it. We can understand why she would be upset. The candidates running for the Republican nomination have constantly tried to equate themselves with her husband. Even though a number of his children have spoken out and said that Reagan would be appalled by the comparisons.While these candidates, like Ted Cruz and (shudder) Donald Trump, name drop the former president during every GOP debate, they behave like schoolyard bullies and pledge to never compromise with Democrats. Reagan may have had faults (A LOT of them) but he knew how to compromise and he never, ever behaved the way the current Republican Party does.As a matter of fact, if Ronald Reagan was a candidate in this race, the others running would probably call him a RINO and a traitor. And they damn sure wouldn t support any amnesty plan for undocumented immigrants (like the one he is well-known for).The current GOP is so gross that when news of Nancy s passing spread, their voters took it as on opportunity to attack the current first lady, Michelle Obama.With all of this, is it really any wonder she was upset?Watch:https://youtu.be/TZUVIbWbT2w Featured image via video screenshot",0
"LEFTIST MEDIA DESTROYED Mike Flynn, Cracked Jokes After Horrible LIE Obama’s National Security Advisor Told Media, Families Of Benghazi Victims [VIDEO] Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack.

"#PhoenixRally ROCKS! WATCH: President Trump Calls Out “Antifa” Terror Group…Crowd Chants “CNN SUCKS” President Trump spoke to a huge and enthusiastic crowd tonight in Phoenix, AZ. It wouldn t be Donald J. Trump if he didn t call out our dishonest and very fake news media. Trump told the crowd,  Media doesn t want to report that I spoke out against violence and bigotry  in reference to his comments following the horrible clashes in Charlottesville, VA, where in the aftermath, Trump blamed both sides. The media quickly condemned him and tried to twist his words to make it appear as though he refused to condemn the KKK, simply because he wasn t willing to let the violent George Soros, anti-American group Antifa or the violent domestic terror group, Black Lives Matter off the hook for their part in the violent conflict.PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""Media doesn't want to report that I spoke out against bigotry and violence."" pic.twitter.com/mS66R0Gvzv  Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) August 23, 2017Trump went after the media for pushing a false narrative and assisting the Democrat Party to divide our nation.PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""It's time to expose the crooked media's deceptions.

"COLLEGE PROFESSOR CAUGHT ON TAPE: You Can’t Have Peace If ‘Whiteness’ Exists…Poor Whites Also Have ‘Privilege” Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible. It s like a club you belong to without asking to be part of it, Harrison said.Via: Daily Caller",0
"ERIC BOLLING Accuser Is Serial Sexual Harassment Accuser, P*ssy-Hat Wearing, Trump-Hating, Left-Wing Activist Professor Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers   two at Fox Business and one at Fox News.Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News  top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes. The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with  some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country  after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com   Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly  filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure,  according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network. Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her. [Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have  fun.  He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go,  Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex. Bolling s team is denying the accusations. Heldman s social media profiles show her to be a staunch left-wing feminist activist.  Big League PoliticsMany brought up #pizzagate in response to my ""good people don't vote for rapists"" sign at Trump's inauguration. https://t.co/lTDtBEhhgh pic.twitter.com/T2S8UfIF5O  Caroline Heldman (@carolineheldman) June 22, 2017Seriously though, the fact that accuser Caroline Heldman would use a picture of themselves with the pal and high-profile, media whore lawyer Gloria Allred at the top of their Twitter account is pretty interesting.Here is Caroline Heldman s Twitter profile:Social media users attempted to accuse Michelle Fields of being one of the women accusing Bolling of sexual harassment.

"The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil  Dr Can Erimtan 21st Century WireDid Donald J. Trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world?!? Did he have any idea that the whole wide world, including the United Nations, would turn against him?On Wednesday, 6 December 2017, in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room the President of the United States proceeded to make history, or, proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion: I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. In his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement, Trump explained that  [i]n 1995, [under Bill Clinton s watch, that is] Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.  In this way, the 45th U.S. President showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed, as he uttered words that neither Bill Clinton, nor George W. Bush or, more importantly perhaps, Barack Obama had dared speak.Yes, Trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name   in spite of the vehemently pro-Israel stance taken by the U.S. ever since the time of President Eisenhower (1953-61) and particularly, ever since the Six Day War (5-10 June 1967), in spite of the ceaseless activities of AIPAC and J Street, no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the New World and the Promised Land. Only, Donald J. Trump had the gall to  deliver,  doing what Clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise . . . until now, that is.In true Aristotelian fashion Trump took the potentiality that was Jerusalem (known as Al Quds or the Sacred City in the Muslim world) and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city. Following these presidential words, outspoken Israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the White House. Mark Regev, the erstwhile spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem (2004-7) and frequent Israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media, and currently even active as Israeli Ambassador in London (since 2015) blurted out that he  think[s] this was a just move and a good move for peace. His boss, Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu (fourth premiership, 2015 present) was equally forthcoming, talking to the press on the same day the U.S. President made his performance in the Diplomatic Reception Room:  Thank you President Trump for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  The PM in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words, declaring that  [t]here is no peace that doesn t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The idea that Jerusalem should be at the heart of the Jewish people s  land and nation namely has its roots in the Bible, in 2 Chronicles 6:5-6, to be precise:  Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel,  as worded in the New International Version. And Bibi knows that too.Bibi even took his words of praise abroad. First to Paris, where he met with President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged his U.S. counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room performance (10 December 2017). Bibi disagreed volubly with the Frenchman, characterising as  absurd  anyone not willing to recognise the  millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.  Next, even proceeding to refer to God s word that had elevated Jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple:  [y]ou can read it in a very fine book   it s called the Bible.  The following day he went to Brussels, where he attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (11 December 2017). The Israeli PM told the gathered EU FM as well as the assembled press corps that Trump s Jerusalem declaration  makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace. The Invention of the Jewish People and the Position of Jerusalem in IslamThe state of Israel, as a Jewish nation state implanted on Middle Eastern soil in 1948, employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence. The Israeli journalist and author Daniel Gavron, for example, states that  most Israelis [regard it as] axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3,000th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by King David [in 1995] mark[ed] a real and tangible event,  even though he himself doubts its authenticity. In other words, the Jewish people, as a shorthand for the Israeli citzenry, have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by Bibi for quite a while. But, as I explained at length some time ago, the mere mention of the term  nation  or even just  people  is a problematic issue in its own right   the point that I am trying to get across is that  nations  or  people  cannot be perceived as  natural  or even  organic  phenomena, but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger  artificial  whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures   leaders of men and their organisations. It has been nearly ten years now that the historian Schlomo Sand published his groundbreaking text The Invention of the Jewish People, which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner, amongst others, but, as seems blatantly apparent from looking at Bibi s recent proclamations, his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble, in spite of having topped Israeli bestseller list  for nineteen weeks. With regard to the city of Jerusalem, on the other hand, archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the  site has been continuously occupied for some 5,000 years,  signalling the urban centre s pre-Jewish roots. But the notion that King David conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky. Gavron explains that the  biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have, and in the opinion of most modern scholars, the Bible is not an entirely reliable historical document.  Still, archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain David indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century BCE   namely, a small  triangular piece of basalt rock . . . subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of Syria and later smashed by an Israelite ruler  carrying an Aramaic inscription talking about a  Beit David ( House  or  Dynasty of David ). But the Jewish  conquest  of Jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover and/or occupation: remaining in ancient times, the Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 BCE, whereas the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign (598 BCE), but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of Titus, son of the Roman Emperor Vespasian (70 CE), in response to the Jews  Great Revolt against Rome that had sprung up in 66 CE. The ultimate outcome of Rome s harsh response was the  Diaspora,  as explained by the American rabbi, lecturer, and author Joseph Telushkin, who estimates that  as many as one million Jews died  as a result, while carrying in its wake the  almost two-thousand-year span of Jewish homelessness and exile.  With the majority of Jews apparently dispersed from the land and city, Jerusalem was eventually conquered by the Caliph Umar (reign 634-44) in the year 638, an event which seems to have taken place following a  peaceful siege, no blood was shed,  in the words of Zia H Shah, a New York-based physician and the Chief Editor of the Muslim Times. The addition of Jerusalem to the Dar al-Islam (or, the abode of Islam) was important. Though the city s name does not appear specifically in the Quran (containing only a reference to  al-Masjid al- Aqsa  or the  Furthest Mosque,  17:1), it is the locus of the Prophet s miraculous Night Journey (or Mi raj). The story, as related in various prophetic traditions (or hadith), tells how the figure of the Prophet travelled from  Makkah to the Furthest Mosque (in Jerusalem), from whence he ascended Heaven, so that Allah might  show him of Our signs. As a result, the Masjid al- Aqsa, arguably built by the Caliph Umar though no historical records exist to this effect, is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in Islam, following the Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, and Al Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah.A Pseudo-Ottoman Gambit: Diverting Attention for a PurposeAs a result, Donald Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room stunt far supersedes the thorny Palestinian issue, the life-and-death matter of peace in the Middle East, or even the real estate division between East and West Jerusalem. The English-language pan-Arab television channel Al Jazeera English matter-of-factly point out on its website that  [v]iolence, protests and arrests have followed US President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All across the globe Muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of Trump s latest attempt to act like a real president, a president unlike any of his predecessors:  [r]allies against Trump s decision also took place in the Indian city of Mumbai, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and the Japanese capital, Tokyo.  But also in Turkey   where President Recept Tayyip Erdo an (aka the Prez)  has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the Ottoman sultans of old   after all, Sultan Selim I (1512-20) took hold of the city of Jerusalem in 1517, remaining part of the Ottoman fold till the onset of the British Mandate (1917-48). On Thursday and Friday, (7-8 December 2017),  spontaneous  meetings took place throughout the whole of the country, from Istanbul over Bursa, Ankara, and Mersin, to Hatay, Gaziantep, Tatvan, Adana, Van, and Kahramanmara . More importantly, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held a meeting in Istanbul on 13 December 2017, and the Prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of Islam, defying not just the United States of America and Israel, but also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nominal Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. As I have written quite some time ago, the Prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally King Salman and see himself as the rightful Calip of the world of Islam, in true pseudo-Ottoman fashion.The OIC meeting dutifully released its  Istanbul Declaration on  Freedom for Al Quds' : [a]ppreciating the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting the Extraordinary Islamic Summit regarding this important cause of Ummah, especially the call for this Extraordinary Summit made by His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdo an (image, left), President of the Republic of Turkey . . . We reject and condemn the US Administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of Al Quds . . . Just like the fact that Israel s decision to annex Al Quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted, we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience, justice and history. We invite all members of the UN, the EU and the international community to remain committed to the status of Al Quds and all related UN Resolutions. Rather than accomplishing anything much at all, the extraordinary OIC meeting primarily served to heighten Tayyip  Erdo an s prestige, at home as well as abroad. As such, a cynic would say that Trump s timing was impeccable, as 17/25 December marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as #AKPgate that erupted in 2013, and that presently was very much on people s minds in Turkey given that the Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab (or R za Sarraf, in Turkish) was appearing in court in New York. The court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon Iran and many Turks eagerly followed the proceedings on Twitter. One Istanbul-based writer Kareem Shaheen described the accusations as follows:  [i]n a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday [30 November 2017] that [Tayyip] Erdo an, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had [also] bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer  a layan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. As a result, given that the Zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire Turco-American relationship, Trump s Jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for Erdogan. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital finally absolved the Erdogan from any attempts to salvage the cross-Atlantic relationship, and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the Republic of Turkey is now the rightful heir to the Ottoman Empire and the only hope left for Muslims across the world, Muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive U.S. foreign policy. And, putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent, Erdo an announced on Thursday, 17 December 2017, that he would establish a Turkish Embassy in Jerusalem, representing Ankara in Palestine, to be clear. Speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of Karaman, the Prez declared  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  in Jerusalem.All the while, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and Israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the Gaza strip and crack down on Palestinian protesters But, Trump has done his deed, leaving his indelible mark on the Middle East, while the Prez, in turn, can now rightfully claim that he alone is able to represent the Muslim world on the international arena.*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent scholar who was living in Istanbul for some time, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East.

"HILLARY TWEETS MESSAGE In Defense Of DACA…OOPS! 2014 VIDEO Of Hillary EMERGES Saying Illegal Kids Should Be Sent Back No time to waste   we've got to fight with everything we've got to #DefendDACA. Thanks, @jorgeramosnews, for sharing these powerful stories. https://t.co/rNtZZ4ONBy  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 4, 2017Mediaite   But what about the interview Hillary did with CNN s Christiane Amanpour to promote her previous book,  Hard Choices ? A video has emerged showing the interview where Hillary told Amanpour that she believed the DACA kids should be sent back.During the exchange, Clinton had some tough words for the children of illegal immigrants, including waves of unaccompanied minors coming in 2014   telling Amanpour that the United States was a nation of laws and that they probably had to go.Watch at the 2:20 mark: The exchange went like this:AMANPOUR:  So, you re saying they should be sent back now? CLINTON:  Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we ve got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security.But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn t mean the child gets to stay. So, we don t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey. Of course, Hillary is never one to keep her promises. As soon as she began campaigning, she began to change her tune on DACA: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,  said Clinton.  But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. ",0
"HOW OBAMA MADE IT POSSIBLE For Protesters To Be ARRESTED And Sent To JAIL For Disrupting Trump Rallies So is anyone else wondering why the cop-hating, racist, Bernie Sanders supporter Tommy DiMassimo wasn t arrested and charged with a felony? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign rallies have become a fixture in the 2016 election season as much for the candidate s rambling speeches as for the frequent interruptions of said speeches.Demonstrators have filed in to Trump rallies across the country, shouting their anti-Trump messages and promptly being ridiculed by rally-goers and led out by law enforcement.On Saturday, Trump began to call for the arrest of protesters as he was repeatedly interrupted, raising questions about the legality of protest and whether Trump can press charges against demonstrators. So what are the answers?The short answer is, no.According to H.R. 347 (signed into law by Barack Hussein Obama in February, 2012) it is ILLEGAL under CURRENT FEDERAL to protest of any type, in an area under protection by the U.S. Secret Service.Because Donald Trump is under Secret Service Protection (as is Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders) and has been since November of 2015, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to protest at campaign rallies, and is in fact, punishable by imprisonment.Free Speech isn t covered at ANY Trump, Clinton, Sanders (or Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) rally because protests are considered to be  knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of an official Federal function. Law enforcement has simply tossed out protesters at Trump rallies, but H.R. 347 states that they could be imprisoned for up to a year for trespassing.Demonstrators are technically relegated to free speech zones much like the ones seen on college campuses.Such zones are often used to keep dissenters away from media attention, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.At a recent Trump event at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, the two designated free speech zones were not in sight of the arena where the rally was held. One was a quarter mile away.Trump can call for the arrest of whomever he wants, but he can t do the arresting.He has said, however, that he is  going to start pressing charges  against protesters as a way to intimidate them into thinking twice about demonstrating at his rallies.Based on the change to H.R. 347 in 2012, he may have grounds to press for trespassing charges against any protester who walked into the rally knowing it was a restricted area, according to the ACLU.

" It’s About Time! Twitter Just Kicked Off A Bunch Of Alt-Right Accounts For Hate Speech Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended. He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.  On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit. USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism,  Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter. I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service. They have done nothing,  Beirich said on Monday. It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been  verified.  This means Twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor",1
" Pat Robertson Endorses Trump: He ‘Inspires Us All’ (VIDEO) Uncle Pat is off his meds again. The crazy host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s decades-long hit show The 700 Club has endorsed Donald Trump. Even though Trump never showed any indication of being a devout Christian prior to his running for the GOP presidential nomination, Robertson has decided that Trump is the man if you want to vote Christian. In a recent event at Regent University, Robertson gave Trump glowing praise, saying that he  inspires us all.  He also said that Trump is  the most amazing people in the whole country.  Here is the video, via Right Wing Watch:Christian Broadcasting Network reporter David Brody also heaped praise upon Trump, and afterwards, Trump continued his now-familiar anti-immigrant rhetoric to his crowd of rabidly racist supporters. He went went so far as to insist that any policy but his would result in, and I quote, the idea that  every illegal gets an air conditioner. Nevermind the fact that this has never been proposed by anyone who likes the idea of legalized paths to citizenship   it s just plain stupid. The only plan for Trump right now is to promote pure, unabashed hatred toward anyone not straight, white, male, and Christian. Thanks to the GOP creating this hateful base, it should be no surprise that these are Trump s supporters.Thusly, it is also no surprise that one of those said supporters is hateful television preacher Pat Robertson.Watch another video of this nonsense below:Featured image via video screen capture",0

Charles Barkley wants to move All-Star game due to 'Anti-LGBT' lawhttps://t.co/P0hK7FpJFo  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 8, 2016Retired professional basketball player and NBA analyst Charles Barkley has been bringing politics into this year s March Madness tournament left and right.His latest comments center around Indiana s Religious Freedom Act, the left s latest punching bag. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable to me,  Barkley said Friday in a statement released through his agent to USA Today.  As long as anti-gay legislation exists in any state, I strongly believe big events such as the Final Four and Super Bowl should not be held in those states  cities. The Religous Freedom Act prevents Indiana state and local governments from  substantially burdening a person s ability to exercise their religion   unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it,  according to the Indianapolis Star.The legislation, which will take effect July 1, makes no specific mention of sexual orientation, but it was quickly dubbed  anti-gay  by opponents.Barkley also turned the popular basketball tournament political when he made comments about President Obama s March Madness bracket. He said that people were criticizing Obama for filling out a bracket because  he s black.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",0

"STUNNER! FLORIDA TRUMP EVENT: Former Haitian Senate President Drops CLINTON BOMBSHELL Exposing Unbelievable Corruption [VIDEO] Former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq exposes all of the dirty dealings of the Clinton s in Haiti while he was still in office. Donald Trump to his credit, allowed him to speak his mind and expose to the world what kind of criminals are attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq also claims he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to  side  with the Clinton Administration and he would  be the richest man in Haiti. He also suggests that Hillary Clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claims they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti. Watch this stunning confession of bribery, and threats during the Clinton presidency when Bill tried to oust the regime in Haiti. ",0
" Trump Finally Delivers On Promised Phone Call To Soldier’s Wife, Says The Most Disgusting Thing EVER After two days of controversy over Donald Trump s lack of response, attention, or even seeming to notice the four soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger nearly two weeks ago, he finally called the pregnant widow of one of the fallen soldiers, Sergeant LaDavid Johnson. At Miami International Airport, where she awaited the remains of her 25-year-old husband, Myeshia Johnson took the president s 5-minute call.On hand with Myeshia Johnson was Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, the US Representative from Johnson s district. Wilson has been critical of Trump s response   or lack of one   for longer than this has even been in the national spotlight. Sgt. Johnson s body was left behind after the ambush, and not recovered by the military for two days after the operation. Many questions remain about the ambush, the operation, and the planning that went into the entire effort. Some consider Trump s bluster on calling military families and his attack on President Barack Obama to be a distraction from those questions that have arisen.According to Rep Wilson, the phone call was  insensitive and insane,  and if accurate, what she conveyed from Sgt. Johnson s widow is possibly the worst thing anyone has ever said to the widow of a soldier, let alone the worst thing a president has said. Trump told Mrs. Johnson, He knew what he signed up for But when it happens it hurts anyway. Those are the words of a man who has either never suffered a loss or has never cared about one.The call was first reported by Ross Palombo, the Washington Bureau Chief for an ABC affiliate in Miami. After Palombo tweeted about the Congresswoman s account of the call, he was contacted by the White House, only for officials to chide him and tell him that the affair was none of his business:BREAKNG: Top White House official tells me about @realDonaldTrump comment to soldier s widow  The President s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.  @WPLGLocal10  Ross Palombo (@RossPalombo) October 18, 2017This kind of response is, unfortunately, just what America has come to expect from the disgusting Donald Trump and his cohorts in the White House.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

"WATCH: GERALDO EMBARRASSES San Juan Mayor Who Said Trump’s “Killing” Puerto Ricans: “I Don’t See People Dying” Let s hope this angry leftist mayor doesn t prevent individual donors from contributing to help the people of San Juan who may not agree with her hateful attacks on our President, who is bending over backward to get the help to the victims of the hurricane.Is anyone else sick and tired of hearing this mayor whine about everything America is NOT doing for her? San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities. The woman even went so far as to say that U.S. armed forces need to  come in and distribute the aid. Via: MRCTV",0
"PRESIDENT TRUMP’S Illegal Immigrant Crackdown Begins…Feds Conduct Raids In At Least 6 States With Focus On Finding And Deporting Criminals [VIDEO] U.S. immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least a half-dozen states this week in a series of raids that marked the first large-scale enforcement of President Trump s Jan. 26 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.The raids, which officials said targeted known criminals, also netted some immigrants who did not have criminal records, an apparent departure from similar enforcement waves during the Obama administration that aimed to just corral and deport those who had committed crimes.Trump has pledged to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Last month he also made a change to the Obama administration s policy of prioritizing deportation for convicted criminals, substantially broadening the scope of who the Department of Homeland Security can target, to include those with only minor offenses or those with no convictions at all.Immigration officials confirmed that agents this week raided homes and workplaces in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, the Los Angeles area, North Carolina and South Carolina, netting hundreds of people. But Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said they were part of  routine  immigration enforcement actions. ICE dislikes the term  raids,  and prefers to say authorities are conducting  targeted enforcement actions. Christensen said the raids, which began Monday and ended Friday at noon, found undocumented immigrants from a dozen Latin American countries.  We re talking about people who are threats to public safety or a threat to the integrity of the immigration system,  she said, noting that the majority of those detained were serious criminals, including some who had been convicted of murder and domestic violence.U.S. immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least a half-dozen states this week in a series of raids that marked the first large-scale enforcement of President Trump s Jan. 26 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.The raids, which officials said targeted known criminals, also netted some immigrants who did not have criminal records, an apparent departure from similar enforcement waves during the Obama administration that aimed to just corral and deport those who had committed crimes.Trump has pledged to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

"BREAKING: TWO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES Drop Out Of 2016 Presidential Race…Questions Linger Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie dropped out of the campaign for the Republican nomination for president today. The prospect of not making Saturday s GOP debate on CBS as a result of poor finishes in New Hampshire last night possibly triggered the pullout . The 2016 Presidential race is quickly dwindling down but questions linger regarding the two who dropped out today: Did Chris Christie miss his opportunity to have success at a run for president in 2012? He said at the time that he wasn t ready to run and then the Bridgegate scandal happened tarnishing his chances for a clean entrance into the 2016 campaign. If he had remained in the race, there s no doubt the scandal would have been a topic for discussion. One thing is for sure, Christie was able to damage Rubio in the last debate with his repeated claims that Rubio was spitting out canned sound bites he d memorized. Ouch! He also claimed that Rubio wasn t ready to be president.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie formally suspended his presidential campaign today.The New Jersey governor held a meeting with his campaign staff at 4pm this afternoon to thank them and announce the news, a spokesperson to the campaign confirms to ABC News.The decision comes a day after the New Jersey governor came in a disappointing 6th place in New Hampshire, despite a heavy investment of time and funds into the first-in-the-nation primary contest. We came to new Hampshire to bring the message,  Christie told gathered supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire as election results rolled in last night.  The message was heard by a lot of folks. And it was stood for by a lot of folks here in New Hampshire, just not enough.  Via: ABC Carly Fiorina Ends Her Bid For The Republican NominationWas Carly Fiorina s campaign for president harmed by ABC demoting her to the undercard debate stage? It s certainly a question that s been asked since the night of the debate. She really never recovered after that night.Carly Fiorina is exiting the Republican presidential race after a seventh-place showing in last night s New Hampshire primary. While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,  said Fiorina in a statement.Fiorina was an unconventional candidate. Her only previous political effort had been a 10-point loss in a race for U.S. Senate in California, and her tenure at Hewlett-Packard was most notable for her being fired by the board of directors after an unsuccessful merger with Compaq.Still, Fiorina struck a chord with many Republican voters, many of whom were especially drawn to her fierce anti-abortion viewpoints and spirited appearances on the campaign trail and in debates.

"WOW! Former Professional Boxer Wearing “Soldier Of Allah” T-Shirt Warns 3 British Activists To “Fear For Their Lives” On New Youtube VIDEO In 2015, former professional boxer Anthony Small, was been cleared of plotting to leave Britain to join Islamic State militants in Syria.Apparently it s okay to threaten the lives of British citizens as long as you re not waving an ISIS flag while you do it.Vice  Small s flourishing boxing career came to an end when he converted to Islam at the age of 24. Now known as Abdul-Haqq, he decided the sport s lifestyle was incompatible with his hardline practice of the religion and took up preaching instead.An associate of the infamous Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned organization Al-Muhajiroun, Haqq used social media to share his fundamentalist views of Islam. He regularly posted controversial videos filmed in his home, justifying IS beheadings and terror attacks such as the public killing of UK soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.Here is Anthony Small s most recent video where he targets Britain First co-founder Paul Golding former EDL leader Tommy Robinson along with conservative radio host Katie Hopkins. Keep in mind that Youtube is cracking down on conservatives for  hate speech  while this Muslim man is using Youtube to threaten the lives of 3 popular British activist. Censorship for conservatives is apparently more dangerous than death threats from professional boxers turned Muslim extremists:Haqq s views have led to multiple police raids on his house, as well as accusations of trying to join IS in the Middle East. VICE News spoke to Haqq on the run up to his arrest about police raids, Western foreign policy, and his faith. We then caught up with him again outside London s Old Bailey court after his release.Here s who  Anthony Small Boxer  really is. This video is a great reminder of why Trump was correct about our need to do a better job of vetting our refugees:Go here to see Paul Golding of Britain First s reply to former professional boxer turned  Allah s Soldier  Tommy.

" Fmr. DNI James Clapper: Trump’s Russia Scandal Is Worse Than Watergate (VIDEO) James Clapper was the Director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration. He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious   that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will react when he gets wind of these comments.During remarks he was making at Australia s National Press Club, Clapper said of Trump s scandal-ridden White House: I lived through Watergate. It was a scary time, I have to say though that I think, you know, compare the two, that Watergate pales in my view compared to what we re confronting now. Apparently, Clapper continued to go all in on Trump, as Australian reporter Paul Karp tweeted out the contents of what Clapper was saying:Clapper is absolutely shirtfronting Trump at #NPC #auspol pic.twitter.com/avN2VxKlOR  Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) June 7, 2017This is not the first time Clapper has openly spoken of Trump with contempt; in fact, he recently suggested to Jake Tapper, host of the CNN news shows The Lead and State of the Union, that Trump is a threat to the very fabric of the republic, saying: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. When Tapper pressed Clapper about what he meant about the institutional danger from the inside, Clapper said he meant Trump.Of course, Clapper is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. There has never been such an assault on our Republic from within the very top levels of government, and certainly we ve never had a president who was in the pocket of the Russians the way Trump is. No, this is far, far worse than Watergate, and that is why we must find a way to remove the entire Trump Administration from office as soon as possible.Watch Clapper s remarks below:Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",0
" Here’s Why A Homeless Man Refused To Come Down From A Giant Tree (VIDEO) On March 22, Cody Lee Miller, a homeless man who calls the streets of Seattle, Washington his residence, climbed to the top of an eighty-foot tree.Over the next 25 hours, the city of Seattle watched anxiously as Miller refused all attempts by authorities to coax him down from his perch at the top of the giant conifer.People snapped pictures and took cell phone video, posting to Twitter under the hashtag #manintree.The Seattle Times, Washington Post, Detroit News, USA Today and other media outlets around the country covered the story as it unfolded.Image credit: @VixenRogue via TwitterAt various times Miller threw pine cones and tree branches at rescue workers, as they attempted to coax him down.Watch the video from USA Today on YouTube below.At other times, his behavior seemed even more reckless.Image credit: RT America via Twitter.Toward the end of the day, he built a makeshift bed among the branches where he apparently fell asleep for the night. Image credit: Seattle Times via TwitterMore than a day later, a crowd of onlookers cheered as he finally made his way back to the ground below.Here s video of Miller finally coming down from the tree, courtesy of USA Today on youtube.Once he was safe on the ground, Miller was taken to Harborview Medical Center where he underwent a psychiatric examination. He was then taken to jail, where he was booked on charges of criminal mischief.What prompted Miller to climb the tree in the first place?Aside from obvious mental health issues, KOMO reports that three days before Miller was taken into police custody for the crime of  sitting on the sidewalk  near a Starbucks on East Pike Street.His criminal record suggests it was not the first time he d been arrested for the crime of having nowhere to go. He was arrested more than once in Oregon. The charges included things like criminal mischief, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness.If you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk, if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space, where can you go?Maybe you d try to climb a tree, hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist.Of course that s not how it played out in Miller s case. Climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention.Some, including the police, turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes.Not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation, though.Many Twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues, as well as for those who are homeless.As KOMO reports, at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation.Janice Wilson, who was in town from Crescent City, California, to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles, said she was once homeless herself, 30 years ago.She repeatedly shouted up to the man:  We love you! Come down safely! I heard people out here laughing,  she said.  If somebody s in crisis to the point of putting himself at risk of suicide, what s to laugh about? As of November 2015, there were more than 565,000 homeless people in the United States.The city of Seattle is just one of many American cities that declared a state of emergency in 2015, due to the number of homeless people who reside there.While the number of homeless people in Seattle is on the decline, thanks to an increase in wages in the city, for people with physical and mental disabilities, getting a job and  pulling yourself up by your bootstraps  isn t always the answer.With proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal, productive lives once the condition is treated. But a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment.According to New York Daily News, Miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today.Instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs, it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated, along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the United States.Featured image via video screen capture KOMO  ",1

" California Trump Rally Leads To Violence Between Thousands Of Protestors And Supporters (VIDEO) One of the most tragic aspects of Donald Trump s candidacy (and there have been lots of  tragic aspects) is that he s managed to do something no one thought to be possible for a candidate running for president in 21st Century America: He s managed to not only normalize racism, but violence as well. There have been so many instances of violence that they ve become normalized. In other words, we ve come to expect violence, and even more alarmingly, we ve also come to accept the violence. However, it s important to fight this normalization and continue to report on the absurdity that is Donald Trump.That absurdity was on display outside a Trump rally in California on Thursday as supporters clashed with protestors. Many of the anti-Trump protestors held Mexican and American flags and were outraged at Trump s rhetoric. About 20 protesters out of hundreds were arrested outside of the rally, a Trump supporter was beaten, and property was damaged including a police vehicle.Watch video here:Since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination, Trump has made a series of inflammatory remarks about Mexicans, calling some of the immigrants rapists and murderers. He continuously talks about building a wall to prevent Mexican immigrants from coming into the country. His rhetoric has created a divisive atmosphere that has bred racism and violence.The bottom line is that Trump has created an environment that is tearing the country apart rather than working for unity. If his candidacy is any indication of what his presidency will be like, we are all in deep trouble as a society. He is normalizing the toxicity of violence and racism and should he be elected, America will become a very dangerous place for a lot of people.Featured image via video screenshot.   ",0
" We’re Officially At The ‘My Wife Is Hotter Than Your Wife’ Part Of The Election (TWEETS) Almost every day, this year s presidential election is becoming more and more like a high school election, or rather middle school, at least on the Republican side. Empty promises of walls and this and that being thrown all over the place. They might as well be promising free French fries and all-day recess. Then there s the name-calling from every direction. The only thing left, really, would be a food fight at the next debate.Now, we ve officially gotten to the  my wife is hotter than your wife  part of the election.It all started when an anti-Trump/pro-Cruz group had an ad in Utah featuring Melania Trump in her GQ spread where she was pretty much naked. Trump, and actually rightfully so, was less than pleased. However, he responded in the Middle School fashion that we ve now become accustomed to seeing and went directly after Ted Cruz s wife Heidi, claiming he ll  spill the beans  on her.Taking this ridiculousness a step further, Trump has now retweeted an image that quite honestly screams,  look at my wife, she s so much more attractive than your wife.

"Hillary’s ‘Russian Hack’ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season  Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThe longer this soap opera drags on, it s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not  hack  into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, however, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  Putin is hacking the US elections.  In response, the President is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyber-activity  tools.Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying, We re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.   Presumably, he s referring to a cyber  counter attack  by Washington.It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US?What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington s new anti-Russia movement.On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote,  The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  Russian hack  talking point was purely political, but then again, who s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media.You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words,  comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance.  If you ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?  said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami.Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia   not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system,  we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: The bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10,  Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like,  Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French:  bottom of the bag ) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle? It s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election.Behind Clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton s campaign manager John Podesta   giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out,  Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political,  cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima, the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  Russian government hacks    provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike. No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike s word for it.IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security.The Post s Nakashima then added: The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,  the joint statement said.   We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. Moscow s press secretary s reply:  This is some sort of nonsense,  said Dmitry Peskov.Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that Russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence, other than speculative guesswork, has been presented.Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  Russia did it,  thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona   are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the  Intelligence Community    all agreed that Russia did it. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,  said Clinton.  I find that deeply disturbing. What s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton s 17 agencies :Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta s emails? Answer: nothing.The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016. The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda.In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington s  flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party s decree that Russia is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney, when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are  hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the FBI also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the Trump team with Russia.  Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven t come up with anything.To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government s much vaunted Intelligence Community. Of course, that s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq s imaginary  Winnebagos of Death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks.For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  Washington Intelligence,  I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now,  No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We re not like that. No, this time it s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!  In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim s notorious  Bureau 121  hacked into Sony Pictures. This isn t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121.  Just like with today s  Russian Hack  theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the  Russian Hack  claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike.Jumping the SharkAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative.Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the West.   Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering  with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back.The biggest impact of @wikileaks? Shining a spotlight on Russia s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence  seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as  proof  that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign s desperate claims. It was embarrassing.They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead.Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger. The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video   their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization.Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened.To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,  said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race.  I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,  said Clinton.The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it.Party MeltdownWasserman Schultz s replacement didn t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches   showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to Hillary Clinton. A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN s Jake Tapper. A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.  (Source: Daily Caller)Brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: In addition, it was also revealed how CNN s head political commentator, Gloria Borger, was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the Clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage. You d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN s election coverage.Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5  400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016Worse Than WatergatePerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury   is the FBI s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. There s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe   a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times.So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia, and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top   to the President himself.What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton s server  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  The President s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server    maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it.Sure, he s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club   caught out lying to the American people.On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News)It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action   that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case.On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case   currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a  sexting  scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik. Who is Kadzik?  Zero Hedge reports: Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary s Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik. Oh, and if that wasn t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as  best friends. FOX News confirms: Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,  Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks.To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it.Russia   The Party ScapegoatFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting:  Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville, was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused  the KGB  working with Republicans to  hijack the election  during his wild rant on MSNBC. I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That s what I think,  said Carville.Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB, and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991.These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence   unlike the Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that  Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.  They ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep   a perfect double entendre.The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for  sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry, Samantha Power, and John Kirby, already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown   that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed  rebels  Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki.With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks   and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said,  We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that.What s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although  Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17,  and  Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind.That said, it s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of  Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.  When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders. Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 ElectionOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era.Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere   if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry.Still, we re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington   before it s too late.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",0
"‘Vote All You Want, The Secret Government Won’t Change.’ 21st Century Wire says Those who pull the strings behind the curtain will be a lot harder to get rid of than the puppets which they control.Watch a video of this report here:Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon gave a strong warning to the American people back in 2014 that you can vote all you want   but the Secret Government won t change.Glennon s argument is that a small clique of so-called national security experts, who might otherwise be called elites from the military industrial complex, are always influencing policy makers and over-emphasising security threats.Currently, the only candidate posing a real threat to these elites appears to be Donald Trump, who is claiming he wants  to get along with foreign countries , particularly Russia.But, what is the main reason why we cannot fix this problem? Glennon says it s  the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people .Here are the key questions and responses from the interview:What evidence exists for saying America has a double government?GLENNON: I was curious why a president such as Barack Obama would embrace the very same national security and counterterrorism policies that he campaigned eloquently against. Why would that president continue those same policies in case after case after case? Why would policy makers hand over the national-security keys to unelected officials?GLENNON: It hasn t been a conscious decision. Members of Congress are generalists and need to defer to experts within the national security realm, as elsewhere. They are particularly concerned about being caught out on a limb having made a wrong judgment about national security and tend, therefore, to defer to experts, who tend to exaggerate threats. The courts similarly tend to defer to the expertise of the network that defines national security policy.Isn t this just another way of saying that big bureaucracies are difficult to change?GLENNON: It s much more serious than that. These particular bureaucracies don t set truck widths or determine railroad freight rates. They make nerve-center security decisions that in a democracy can be irreversible, that can close down the marketplace of ideas, and can result in some very dire consequences.Couldn t Obama s national-security decisions just result from the difference in vantage point between being a campaigner and being the commander-in-chief, responsible for 320 million lives?GLENNON: There is an element of what you described. There is not only one explanation or one cause for the amazing continuity of American national security policy. But obviously there is something else going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W. Bush administration.This isn t how we re taught to think of the American political system.GLENNON: I think the American people are deluded to believe that the institutions that provide the public face actually set American national security policy. They believe that when they vote for a president or member of Congress or succeed in bringing a case before the courts, that policy is going to change. Now, there are many counter-examples in which these branches do affect policy. But the larger picture is still true policy by and large in the national security realm is made by the concealed institutions.Do we have any hope of fixing the problem?GLENNON: The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people. And indifference to the threat that is emerging from these concealed institutions. That is where the energy for reform has to come from: the American people. Not from government. Government is very much the problem here. The people have to take the bull by the horns. And that s a very difficult thing to do, because the ignorance is in many ways rational. There is very little profit to be had in learning about, and being active about, problems that you can t affect, policies that you can t change.Read Mark Glennon s 2014 epic Op Ed from the Boston Globe here GET THE FULL STORY ON THE 2016 ELECTION: 21st Century Wire Election Files",0

" WATCH: CNN NAILS Trump For Lie That He Would Never Demand Loyalty Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",1

"MOCKINGBIRD REDUX? CNN’s Role in Peddling Fake ‘Nothing Burger’ Russia-Gate News Revealed 21st Century Wire says CNN has reportedly refused to punish one of its senior producers John Bonifield, after a recent Project Veritas video sting operation exposed the network s role in peddling a fake Russia-gate narrative just for ratings. As if that wasn t enough of a network crisis, CNN s Van Jones was also caught in a new Veritas video sting release stating that the mainstream media s long-running  Russian collusion  story is a  big nothing burger. This latest twin expos comes after three prominent writers from CNN were  urged to resign  (fired) after the network was threatened with an estimated $100 million dollar lawsuit (something which 21WIRE predicted) earlier this week following a bogus story (since retracted) that falsely linked political figure and financier Anthony Scaramucci to a Russian investment fund currently under a congressional probe.NOTE: CNN and other big media outlets have been pushing a vast Russian conspiracy for nearly a year and now those at CNN are brushing off the narrative after being caught in an ongoing deception   MEDIA MOCKERY    Senior CNN producer John Bonifield was caught in a video sting admitting that the Trump-Russia narrative was untrue and Van Jones further confirmed the network s position. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for almost a year, and even more conveniently over this past 2016 US presidential election cycle, before morphing into the dodgy dossier that included unverified Trump-Russia claims. Incredibly, the still as of yet unsubstantiated Russia-Trump collusion story briefly vanished, only to be newly reignited again, after two US military missile strikes in Syria and Afghanistan took place following the fabricated sarin chemical attack allegations in April which the White House claimed hit the Al Nusra-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria.Just this week, the US government warned (a story peddled by CNN among others) of an upcoming, soon-to-be-released alleged  chemical attack  out of Syria, something which would potentially prompt another wag the dog theatrical bombing from the US-led Coalition. Is this false flag foreshadowing by Washington?Perhaps such plans may have been scarpered by a blistering report detailing false sarin claims concerning the Idlib province by award-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh only days ago. Hersh s report, appropriately titled  Trump s Red Line confirmed much of what we at 21WIRE managed to outline in the aftermath of the alleged chemical attack, while also condemning the lack of clear evidence and reactionary military response by the Trump administration even after Russia shared deconfliction intelligence with the US.The fallout from the sarin hoax and CNN Russia-gate spin has also been compounded by an embarrassing retraction from the NY Times over their Russian hack/influence claims said to be confirmed by 17 US intelligence agencies   a story which once again turned out to be a falsehood as recently discussed by well-known investigative reporter Robert Parry.  SARIN HOAX    It s official now, the alleged Syrian chemical attack story was a false narrative that Western media outlets gleefully lapped up. (Image Source: cnn)Propaganda 3.0Here is where the propaganda goes into overdrive.Suddenly, as if by coincidence (or right on cue) Reuters reports that Syria has  heeded  its warning, almost immediately after Hersh s stirring investigative effort laid bare many elements of April s sarin hoax in Syria. That s right: because it issued a warning based on secret intelligence that no one is allowed to see, Washington is somehow claiming credit for stopping a chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime.As both the Russian and Syria narratives continue to crumble, an awkwardness has set in for CNN and the Trump Administration (its Syria policy duly inherited from the Obama Administration)   both of whom have relied on these narratives to prop-up dysfunctional US foreign policy agendas.The recent CNN video sting revelations weakens the already questionable Russian collusion plot line, something which we ve covered extensively here at 21WIRE. In fact, following the highly dubious DDoS attacks in America in October of 2016, we made the following accurate assessment: Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer [of 2016], the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof. Here s a newer Project Veritas video exposing CNN s Van Jones admitting there s no evidence to back-up the Russian conspiracy story Here s another look at the recent Project Veritas video exposing CNN producer John Bonfield admitting the network has pushed a false Russian collusion meme As the Project Veritas series continues, CNN Associate Producer Jimmy Carr disclosed the political bias pushed by the network QUESTION: Why has CNN been peddling Russian collusion allegations without any evidence?It s not just for ratings The new Project Veritas video stings provide more evidence of an overtly political agenda, something we saw throughout the 2016 US presidential election. In fact, the entire video expos  is reminiscent of Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners being caught discussing how to commit large-scale voter fraud, while also apparently outlining how to incite violence at campaign rallies. Unbelievably in the year leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, Creamer met with White House officials some 342 times along with his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff,  in the year leading up to the election.Furthermore, the Russia-gate plot line perpetuated by CNN immediately recalls the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media seen during the Cold War era. In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird that was said to have infiltrated the American news media in particular, which propagandized the public through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups. Is the recent CNN fallout more evidence confirming that a modern version of Operation Mockingbird is alive and well?In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as confirmed by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year. There has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years from big media, despite claims that the NDAA provision offered more transparency to the American public.More from RT below THE FIX    John Bonifield admitted that CNN s Russia collusion narrative is not based on evidence. (Image Source rt)CNN stands behind its producer caught in sting video, says he won t be punishedRTCNN has backed one of its senior producers caught in a Project Veritas sting video, saying the company encourages diversity of personal opinions. John Bonifield was filmed admitting the network s craze over alleged Trump-Russia collusion is  bullsh*t. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong, we welcome it and embrace it,  an email from a CNN spokesman to the Daily Beast reads.  CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield,  it said.CNN Health supervising producer Bonifield, who is not involved in the channel s political coverage, was videotaped saying the company does not have any evidence to support its Russia-Trump narrative, driven mostly by the desire for ratings. It s mostly bullsh*t right now. Like, we don t have any big giant proof,  the CNN producer can be heard saying in the video, adding that US President Donald Trump is  probably right  to accuse them of a conducting a witch-hunt.This story continues at RT READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesREAD MORE ON THE WHITE HELMETS AT: 21st Century Wire White Helmet FilesREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",1
THIS ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING THE MEDIA MISSED That Tells You How The Candidates Feel About America  ,0
" Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET) It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway. Never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe.Trump tweeted this out to stir the pot, yet again:Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2016Which then leads you to this: Hillary has bad judgment!A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 10, 2016 at 10:25am PDTLet s be clear on this. There is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened, Trump thought Libya was a female body part, so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question. He s a bully though, and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up.When every poll shows Hillary Clinton wiping the floor with Trump among women, minorities and the youth vote, he s got to do something. He s desperate, and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the Trump campaign.Bringing up Benghazi again after Clinton has been cleared again and again and again. C mon now, Donald. That s just pathetic, and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",1

" Kellyanne Conway Admits Comey Tapes Probably Exist But Says Trump Doesn’t Have Them (VIDEO) Does Donald Trump have tapes of his conversations with fired FBI director James Comey? Until Thursday, he said yes   but after it became apparent that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had hired a team that included former Watergate investigators, Trump changed his story.Now, he says, he was just trying to obstruct justice by using the idea that there were tapes to intimidate James Comey before he testified   a gambit that led to Comey laughing at him during a public hearing.At this point, Trump would be stupid to personally be in possession of any tapes of their conversations, but White House spokesidiot Kellyanne Conway hints that tapes may exist   Trump just doesn t keep them in his nightstand like they are a book of Adolf Hitler s speeches (yes, he kept a book of Hitler s speeches at his bedside).During an interview with CNN s Alisyn Camerota, Conway refused to say why it took 42 days for The Donald to change his story about the tapes with which he threatened the man whom he fired for requesting additional funding for the Russia investigation   but she used some very interesting wording while attempting to explain away Trump s self-made scandal. So the president made clear yesterday and in an interview aired early this morning, Alisyn, on Fox News, that he doesn t have tapes   didn t make tapes, but he left open the possibility they may exist,  Conway said, hinting that because of the  surveillance and leaking going on  the tapes might just surface. But why did we live this charade, there might be tapes or might not?  Camerota asked. There was no charade,  Conway replied. Answer definitively   there were no audiotapes?  Camerota pressed. He answered definitively yesterday,  Conway shot back. Why is he always on your timeline? Strangely, Conway nor Trump denied that tapes were made. Trump just said he personally didn t record them   which would have been a rookie move even for him   and Conway explained that Trump wasn t personally in possession of them.As Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who is leading the Russia probe, notes, that hardly clears things up.Watch it below:Featured image via screengrab",1
"WALMART Is Selling “Made In Mexico” Apparel Featuring Domestic Terror Group [VIDEO] The domestic terror group, Antifa, has been around for a while, but since Donald Trump s inauguration in January, they ve become more visible and increasingly more violent. Well, good news for Americans who support violent, masked, molotov cocktail throwing, ax and hammer-wielding punks, who run through major cities in packs, busting out windows, setting fire to vehicles, and pretty much destroying anything or anyone in their path, as a way to show their  resistance  to a Donald Trump presidency, Walmart now offers a line of  Antifa  apparel for you. If you re struggling to find the perfect gift for your violent, snot-nosed, anti-Trump student, or unemployed basement dweller in your family this holiday season, you can find it online at Walmart. Walmart is selling  Antifa  clothing that  will [allow you to] express yourself inside the opposition to the ideology, organizations, governments, and people from the far right (fascism). The mega-retailer is offering at least 13 different sweatshirts  made in Mexico of 100% COTTON for all-day comfort  promoting the group whose activities were  formally classified  by the Obama Administration  as domestic terrorist violence  as early as April 2016, according to Politico, despite the group s efforts to downplay this determination. Antifa,  or Anti-Fascist Action, is an informal grouping of communist, anarchist, and other far-left street gangs. Drawing inspiration from the German Communist Party s street fighters of the 1930s, the modern movement grew out of the European far-left punk scene in the 1980s. These unapologetically violent bands of leftists were largely unknown in the United States until recent years, when America s post-Occupy Wall Street far-left began adopting the name.This (anti-Trump) video provides a window into the violent Antifa group and how they destroy other people s property while running from cops and calling for them to be killed. Listen to Antifa chanting:  AK47 put the cops in  piggy heaven  on the streets of Washington DC during Donald Trump s inauguration at about the 1:20-minute mark. Watch what happens to the young Trump supporter who tries to speak reasonably with the Antifa terrorists about how using violence is not the answer, as he puts out a fire started by the terror group at the 9:20-minute mark:Antifa is well known for dozens of violent crimes against people they consider  fascists  on both sides of the Atlantic. Just remember to keep creating a better world,  the clothing advertisements encourage.This glorification of Antifa was mirrored Friday by the New York Times, which published a fashion style guide for the group:  practical advice on how to dress for a riot.  In their guide, the Times explains why a uniform look is needed, from Breitbart News s Charlie Nash: These defensive methods work only if there are enough black-clad others nearby. A single person in all black and multiple face masks is an eye grabber. Finally, the Times claimed that dressing in black militant gear and concealing your face forms an  emotional connection  with other rioters. Tactical considerations aside, it s this emotional connection with other members of the bloc that many practitioners highlight the most in interviews,  they proclaimed.  It s why soldiers and police have uniforms. Walmart has come under previous criticism for selling  Black Lives Matter  shirts and other items. Following a request from the national Fraternal Order of Police, the retail giant eventually removed one of the items last December, shirts that said  Bulletproof,  but refused to remove the rest.As with the  Black Lives Matter  paraphernalia, the Antifa products are being sold by a third party manufacturer, in this case, Tee Bangers, on Walmart s website.

" Woman Gets Death Threats Just For Posting A Picture With Hillary Clinton After last week s election, Hillary supporters found a modicum of comfort in a photo, which quickly went viral. The photo was taken the day after the election. A woman named Margot Gerster, who was hiking through the woods in Upstate New York, ran into Hillary and Bill Clinton. Gerster snapped a photo of her and the Democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media. That s when the sh*t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats.The photo was simply of the two women and Gerster s baby. It in no way questioned or even referenced Donald Trump s election. Instead, it was a reassurance that life goes on, even after a crushing defeat.Within what seemed like hours, the conservative media attacks began. The chance encounter had to be fake, the argument went, because Gerster had met Hillary Clinton once before, many years ago. As if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met.Gerster admits she met Clinton when she was a teenager, but that had nothing to do with last Wednesday s chance encounter: It was so long ago,I do not remember. All I knew was that I was going to a nice dinner and Hillary Clinton was there,  she said.The mom dismissed accusations she s a long-time ally of the Clintons who secretly planned and engineered the heart-warming, post-election snap. If I were long-time friends of the Clintons, I wouldn t be keeping that a secret. I d be bragging about it to everyone I know,  Gerster said.Source: New York PostGerster insists, and Federal Election Commission records confirm, that she didn t even donate to Clinton.But, conservatives never let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory and Gerster says she s been getting death threats, although there s no record she s reported them to the cops. I don t want to discuss this anymore,  said Gerster, 30.  This story needs to go away. It got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of people, but I don t want this to add on to this (blowback), I don t want to fuel the fire. Who can blame her? Trump has clearly unleashed an ugly and violent underbelly in America. No one is safe.Featured image via Margot Gerster screen capture. ",0
"MULTI-MILLIONAIRE #NFL PLAYERS Take Knee During National Anthem On 9-11 To Protest “OPPRESSION” Next To Armed Forces Who Risk Their Lives For Less Than 20K Per Year [VIDEO] Does anyone else find it ironic that black multi-millionaire athletes are protesting oppression in America after 8 years of our first Black President?How much courage does it take for these multi-millionaire athletes to stand in protest against the flag our US military members defend with their lives every day? Members of our Armed Forces are making between $17,892 and $34,696 in basic pay, depending upon time served in the military and rank. But yeah we can see why you multi-millionaire punks who are treated like royalty wherever you go, are all feeling so oppressed that you need to disrespect our flag and the brave men and woman who stand on the field next to you, while you spit on their sacrifices as a way to promote Obama s Black Lives Matter legacy NFL player-activists continued to take a knee Sunday during the national anthem to protest alleged oppression of blacks in America.On Sunday in Seattle, Dolphins running back Arian Foster, wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas, and linebacker Jelani Jenkins took a knee as everyone else rose to honor America. They are taking a knee for  injustice in America,  according to civil-rights activist Shaun King.But what is the end game? How will we know when the injustice has subsided to the point so they can stand again?Perhaps when the murder rate in Chicago falls. It s currently on a record pace (512 so far this year) with most of the victims African-American. Or maybe when the black teen unemployment employment rate of 31 percent, six times higher than the national average, improves.Maybe that is what the NFL activists are waiting on, for these two oppressive situations to be fixed.Watch here:We will see. Don t hold your breath. This seems like a one-note song   it s clearly an extension of the Black Lives Matter movement, and it s about police killing a few unarmed black suspects.

" Trump’s Klan Endorsement Generates Epic Newspaper Front Page (IMAGE)  The NY Daily News, one of the tabloid newspapers that also happens to be a hometown publication for Donald Trump, has produced another cover mocking the fascist billionaire.Appearing on the front of Friday s newspaper is a Ku Klux Klansman in full dress, announcing an endorsement of Trump s presidential career.An early look at tomorrow's front page:TRUMP FOR PREZ   Ex-KKK leader: Donald just like us! https://t.co/kVep9MWIZz pic.twitter.com/ls4iIFxlsn  New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) February 26, 2016The cover is a reference to the announcement from infamous former KKK leader David Duke that he is fully backing Trump s campaign. Duke told listeners to his underground radio show that it is the duty of white supremacists to vote for the current Republican presidential front runner. Voting for these people, voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage,  Duke said on the David Duke Radio Program. BuzzFeed News first reported the comments. I m not saying I endorse everything about Trump. In fact, I haven t formally endorsed him. But I do support his candidacy, and I support voting for him as a strategic action. I hope he does everything we hope he will do. Duke also told his fellow white supremacists that they need to go out and volunteer for Trump, noting: And I am telling you that it is your job now to get active. Get off your duff. Get off your rear end that s getting fatter and fatter for many of you everyday on your chairs. When this show s over, go out, call the Republican Party, but call Donald Trump s headquarters, volunteer. Trump has consistently appealed to bigotry in his campaign. He first launched his effort by calling Mexicans rapists, then proceeded to advocate for registering Muslims and barring them from entering the United States. Trump himself has also been caught several times using his Twitter account to amplify the messages of white supremacists and other racists, who are loudly backing his campaign online and attacking his critics.Featured image via Flickr",1
"Report: Facebook’s Zuckerberg Gave FBI’s Mueller Info for Russia Investigation The information below is almost like a satire piece from The Onion.

THIS PROVES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!A WHOPPING $100,000 ON ADS:Facebook has turned over all information about ads  likely  purchased by Russian operatives to special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the social media giant had sent the former FBI director data including copies of the ads and the identity of the buyers. That report followed news that an internal Facebook investigation found it is agents of the Kremlin may have spent $100,000 on ads with  divisive messages  between June 2015 and May 2017.A Facebook blog post published on Wednesday said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages.PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CORRECT   IT S A  WITCH HUNT :Mueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The investigation has dogged and frustrated President Donald Trump, who has called it a  witch hunt  and a  hoax.

" Tamir Rice’s Memorial Is A Stop In Pokemon Go And It Has A Powerful Message The gazebo at the Cudell Recreation Center in Cleveland, Ohio has become a non-official memorial for Tamir Rice, an innocent 12-year-old who was shot and killed by the police. The gazebo is the location where Rice was killed while playing with a toy rifle.According to Belt Magazine, the location has also recently become a popular stop in the smash hit augmented reality game, Pok mon Go. For those not familiar how the game works, locations of interest   called Pokestops   such as public works of art, historical locations, and other community hot spots.The person who suggested the location be added as a location in the game developer s database took the opportunity to make a statement. The description for the pokestop reads: Community memorial for Tamir Rice, shot and killed by CPD officers who shot him in under 2s after breaking department policy regarding escalation of force. The Cudell Gazebo bears no marker indicating that is a memorial for Rice. The gazebo was scheduled to be demolished though it has not due to certain groups who wish to see the area preserved as a historical landmark. As of right now, the gazebo has remained in a state of limbo. So, besides the stuffed animals and other tokens left by community members, there is no way to tell what the historical importance of what the location is.This virtual marker runs contrary to the findings of a grand jury who decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the shooting.A commentator on the Belt claims to be the person who wrote the description for the Gazebo. He claims that he wrote the description not thinking that it would be noticed by many people, as it was added to a much less popular game created by the same company who created Pokemon Go. He writes that he wrote the description because: Memorials are built in the hope people will remember. The events that ended Tamir Rice s life are something that I worry will be forgotten. It was difficult to see the gazebo pictured without context, and I added a bit without expecting it to be noticed by anyone else. The gazebo in the park should be turned into an official memorial for Rice. However, even if it was the spot would not tell the story that so many people hear. It is nice to know that there are people able to get what many would consider the truth of the story of what happened at that spot than what is on the official record.Featured image from Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1

" Trump Laughably Claims He Knows More About Cyber Attacks Than The CIA Donald Trump is now saying that he knows more about computer hacking than the experts at the CIA and our other intelligence agencies.During an interview with the New York Times prior to a New Year s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, Trump once again defended Russia and Putin by questioning the validity of an assessment by the intelligence community concluding that Russia meddled with our political process. I just want them to be sure because it s a pretty serious charge,  Trump said before invoking the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  If you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. So I want them to be sure. I think it s unfair if they don t know. But that s not exactly true. Former CIA official Tyler Drumheller said in 2006 that the Bush Administration ignored intelligence concluding that Iraq did NOT have weapons of mass destruction. When presented with the assessment, Bush and his team refused to believe it and went to war in Iraq anyway.So when Trump blames the intelligence community for getting WMDs in Iraq wrong, it s inaccurate. They actually got it right. Bush was the one who was wrong by ignoring them.Trump didn t stop there, however. Just like when he claimed to know more about ISIS than our generals, Trump claimed to know more about hacking than the experts at our intelligence agencies. And I know a lot about hacking,  Trup continued.  And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation. He basically said the same thing on Twitter in December.Unless you catch  hackers  in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn t this brought up before election?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016So apparently, Trump fancies himself a military genius and a computer expert.Seriously, Trump needs to stop pretending he knows things that he doesn t really know. The reality is that he has never served in our military. He s an expert at draft-dodging but he is certainly no expert on ISIS. And while he clearly knows how to use social media, Trump definitely does not know how to hack a computer. HOur intelligence agencies know how to trace hacks because hacking leaves traces and signatures that can be used to determine where the hack originated.That s how we know Russia hacked us. It s incredibly dangerous for Trump to claim that he knows all this stuff and that he knows more than the experts. Because then he can undermine the experts all the time and his gullible supporters will believe him instead of the facts, which is what Trump has been doing for over a year and a half now. If Trump knows more about something, it s being a con artist. He s been doing that for decades so he s total pro.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0

With all the rape and violence being committed by these  refugees,  why in the world would we welcome these savage animals into our country? Oh that s right to vote for Democrats A Muslim councilor has admitted that some feel as though  it takes two to tango  as 12 men were jailed for gang-raping a 13-year-old white girl in West Yorkshire.The gang of men from Pakistani origin were jailed for a total of 143 years at Bradford Crown Court today, for 13 months of horrendous abuse of the British white girl in 2011 and 2012. However, the Councillor for Keighley Central, where the abuse took place, has admitted that some members of the community felt  it takes two to tango  and that the girl may have  played her part .Zafar Ali, who has been a member of the Keighley Mosque for decades believes that some of the men may have attended in the past, but said the Muslim community totally condemn their actions.He told MailOnline:  Everyone now believes that justice has been done, we need to move forward and it is a lesson for the whole Muslim community. There are a few bad apples but this does not represent the Muslim community as a whole and any sensible Muslim totally condemns these actions. Eleven of the men were today jailed for rape and a twelfth man was jailed for sexual activity with a child under 16 today at Bradford Crown Court, but the ringleader has fled to Bangladesh.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that the men jailed were of Pakistani origin.The sentences come as it emerged that:Ringleader Ahmed Al-Choudhury who facilitated most of the offences is believed to now be living in Bangladesh after fleeing at the beginning of the investigation in 2012 After the sentencing, Kris Hopkins, Conservative MP for Keighley spoke out against the  sick model of organized groups of  Asian men  grooming young white girls , but said there are more women out there who need justice.He said the sentenced were vindication for controversial comments he made during a parliamentary debate in 2012, claiming that organised groups of Asian men were  going around raping white girls .However, he claims that even today he has been  lambasted  for even mentioning that the men are Asian when talking about the sentences.He told MailOnline:  There are sexual offenders who are white, but the fact is this particular model is all  Asian men  and all the victims were white. I was attacked in 2012 and today, when these men were convicted, the community was silent. You have to ask yourself why these men get away with this behavior. There is broader issues around the way women are treated in that community, there are hundreds if not thousands of women who live behind that door and have no voice. In a Commons speech three years ago, Mr Hopkins caused controversy three years ago when he suggested Muslim men were  fundamentally  sexist towards women.Judge Roger Thomas QC condemned the  insolent and disrespectful behaviour  the accused showed in court which he said reflected their treatment of their victim.They showed her no shred of decency or humanity when as a vulnerable child she so needed care and understandingJudge Roger Thomas QC told them:  The attitudes of the majority of you have so clearly demonstrated to these proceedings has been contemptuous, disrespectful and arrogant on a scale that I have hardly seen before in many years of practice in criminal law.  Exactly the same attitude to the 13/14 year old girl who you all sexually abused and exploited for your own selfish gratification. He added:  None of these defendants had any concern for the victim. They were totally uninterested in her welfare and what damage they were causing her. The victim clearly demanded pity and understanding but their view of her was heartless and demeaning. They saw her as a pathetic figure who had no worth and who served no purpose than to be an object that they could sexually misuse and cast aside. Via: Daily Mail ",1
" American Airlines Throws Ivy League Economist Off Plane For Doing Math Ivy League economist Guido Menzio has reportedly been removed from an American Airlines flight and interrogated after being found in possession of algebra.Menzio had been seated next to a female passenger on the plane who became suspicious that her dark-skinned fellow traveler was writing in a script with which she was unfamiliar. The female passenger then reported Menzio immediately and secretly to cabin crew as a suspected terrorist. She left the plane, citing illness as her excuse. Meanwhile, other passengers began to grumble at the delay. A short while later, Menzio was also escorted from the plane on grounds he would only be made aware of later.When security began to interrogate him about the woman who had left   so far as Menzio knew   due to illness, he believed he was playing a role in supporting their inquiries as to her condition. But they then revealed it was Menzio who was under suspicion and being interrogated as a suspect terrorist.As the Washington Post reports:Had the crew or security members perhaps quickly googled this good-natured, bespectacled passenger before waylaying everyone for several hours, they might have learned that he  Guido Menzio is a young but decorated Ivy League economist. And that he s best known for his relatively technical work on search theory, which helped earn him a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania and stints at Princeton and Stanford s Hoover Institution.They might even have discovered that last year he was awarded the Carlo Alberto Medal, given to the best Italian economist under 40. That s right: He s Italian, not Middle Eastern, or whatever heritage usually gets racially profiled on flights these days.The suspicious scrawl which so perturbed the female passenger and flight crew was nothing more than math. Algebra to be precise.The renowned economist said of his experience in a Facebook post:It s a bit funny. It s a bit worrisome. The lady just looked at me, looked at my writing of mysterious formulae, and concluded I was up to no good. Because of that an entire flight was delayed by 1.5 hours.Trump s America is already here. It s not yet in power though. Personally, I will fight back.Manzi becomes the latest among a litany of Muslim and non-Muslim people to have their lives interrupted and they character made suspect by the sort of casual racism and fear promoted by not only Donald Trump, but much of the mainstream media and conservative political class. After the horrors of McCarthy era America, we would hope the nation would have learned a valuable lesson on restraint. It appears not.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Penn Arts and Sciences",1
"JOHN KERRY BREAKS LEG IN BIKE CRASH IN FRENCH ALPS… [Video] Fortunately, our useless Secretary of State John Kerry was able to make France a part of his taxpayer funded four-nation trip where he had hoped to ride along a small part of the Tour de France according to the Washington Post. Unfortunately, he was unable to take part in the Tour de France or um Iran s nuclear negotiations due to his accident. Our nation is likely better off without John Kerry at the negotiating table with Iran s prime minister anyhow US Secretary of State John Kerry broke his leg in a bike crash Sunday, apparently after hitting a curb while taking a break after talks in Geneva, Switzerland.The diplomat was biking near Scionzier, France before the accident, which caused him to scrap the rest of a four-nation trip that included an international conference on combating the Islamic State group.Kerry, 71, was in stable condition and in good spirits as he prepared to return to Boston for further treatment with the doctor who previously operated on his hip, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said.He said X-rays at a Swiss hospital confirmed that Kerry fractured his right femur in the 9.40am incident. The secretary is stable and never lost consciousness, his injury is not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery,  Kirby said in a statement.Kerry was taken by helicopter to Geneva s main medical center, HUG, after apparently hitting a curb with his bike in the French town about 40 kilometers southeast of the Swiss border.Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with his motorcade at the time and provided him immediate attention. They quickly decided to order the 10-minute-long helicopter transport.Kerry s cycling rides have become a regular occurrence on his trips. He often takes his bike with him on the plane and was riding that bicycle Sunday. Via: UK Daily Mail",0

" Right Wing Drudge Report Calls Beyoncé An ‘Urban Terrorist’ Because Racism Is Dead In America Beyonc  is already a favorite target of hate for the right-wing because she s: A. Black B. A woman C. Rich D. Powerful E. Not ashamed of being black and F. Did I mention she s black? But the so-racist-it-might-as-well-be-Stormfront Drudge Report took Beyonc  hating to a new low because of the  Hold Up  music video released over the weekend.Off of the album  Lemonade,  Hold Up is a suuuuuper angry song and video dealing with Beyonc s very justifiable rage at her husband Jay-Z for cheating on her. In the video, she takes a bat and smashes the crap out of stuff. It s not entirely clear why this is controversial in the slightest. Anyone who s been cheated on wants to smash everything around them; it s a perfectly natural reaction to that kind of hurt and betrayal. So, of course, Drudge Report responded to it like this: Urban,  of course, is a right-wing dog whistle for  ni**er  but why a  terrorist?  Oh, right, because Beyonc  supports Black Lives Matter and had the nerve to recognize black history during the Super Bowl so anything she does these days is scary to the poor, persecuted white minority of America.The article Drudge links to is just as tasteless, shoehorning in President Obama and soon-to-be-president Hillary Clinton by lamenting that Obama, previously a fan,  may be changing his policy on Beyonc .  Because only white people are allowed to be angry or something. When black people do it, they re out of control and savages. Didn t you know that already?Later, the article comments on Beyonc s album about being cheated on and forgiving her husband by saying:Indeed, all of  Lemonade  appears to be Beyonc  saying she s made lemonade from lemons  meaning she s somehow stuck it out in a bad marriage despite lying and infidelity. That sounds more like the Clintons  story than the Obamas .HAHAHAHAHAHAH! That didn t feel forced at all. Even a little.Now, if Beyonc had gone out and actually smashed people s cars in a rage instead of channeling her anger into a creatively destructive music video, OK, fine, call her names. But for the love of all that s holy, it s a MUSIC VIDEO. I know Drudge makes money by feeding the hate and rage of the right-wing but this is a stretch, even for them.By the way, if you want to see Beyonce get righteous with a bat, you ll have to go to TIDAL and sign up for a free trial.Featured image via Getty",0
" Traumatized Indiana Mom ‘Terrified’ After Becoming Target Of White Supremacists (VIDEO) Mia Frias-Russell, an African American mother of three, recently moved from Indianapolis, Indiana to the smaller town of Campbellsburg, nearly 600 miles away. According to City Data, the town has a population of less than 600 people and 97.4 percent of the residents are white.Ms. Russell says she has experienced various forms of racial discrimination since moving to the small Indiana town. During an interview with WTHR, she said people yell racial slurs at her while she s outside working in the yard.On July 20, the situation escalated. Ms. Russell stepped outside her Campbellsburg home that morning to find racial slurs sprayed all over her house. The words  N*gg*r go,  and  N*gg*r b*tch  were among the messages left for the mother and her three children. Her car was also painted with racial slurs. Authorities also believe that the vandals put sugar in the vehicle s gas tank.The terrified mom recorded a video of the aftermath, which she then uploaded to Facebook.  I m scared,  she said through her tears,  I don t know who could have done this.  Ms. Russell went on to say that the day before someone tried to run her car off the road.Watch the video below via YouTube:According to WTHR, Ms. Russell is renting her home in Campbellsburg. She is now trying to get out of her lease because she does not feel safe living in the area. She described the incident as both  traumatizing  and  terrifying. Authorities say they are looking for the people responsible for vandalizing Ms. Russell s home. According to ISP Sgt. Jerry Goodin those responsible will be charged with criminal mischief. The police may also upgrade the charges using the state s bias crime statute. Indiana s bias crime statute is similar to hate crimes statutes used to enhance criminal charges in other parts of the United States.It s unimaginable that, in the year 2016, this young mother does not feel safe driving down the street or even falling asleep in her own home. This is terrorism and those who were involved should be prosecuted as terrorists, not as vandals or petty criminals.Image credit; video screen capture via Mia Frias-Russell on Facebook",1
" Donald Trump Attacks Obama, Says He Understands The World ‘Much Better’ Than POTUS (VIDEO) It was just a few days ago that President Barack Obama absolutely destroyed Donald Trump on his controversial comments about nuclear power. Speaking to reporters at the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., Obama addressed the Republican front runner s remarks that more countries should have nuclear weapons, and gracefully called Trump out for being a complete idiot when he said: The person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally. It was completely true and obvious statement to most   but not Trump, who lives in a self-absorbed, denial-filled bubble. Always ready to start an immature feud with people far more qualified than himself, Trump has decided to hit back at Obama   in a way that makes him seem like even more of a moron. During a campaign stop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin yesterday, Trump literally decided to tell people that he understands  the world much better  than Obama. Seriously. Watch that ridiculous moment below:For Trump to blatantly say that he knows more about how the world works than Obama, who has been an extremely successful President for the last 8 years and done more for American than Republicans will ever give him credit for, is a hilarious and yet terrifying demonstration in Trump s obvious lack of self-awareness.Trump followed that comment with criticism for the President s treatment of Syrian refugees, making the argument that the United States should not be letting them enter the country. Trump said: We have no idea where they come from. They could be ISIS, and they might not be, but they could be ISIS. Did you ever notice the migration? There are so many young strong men. Where are the women and children?And I said don t let them in, we can t let them in. We ll build a safe zone, we ll build a free zone  We ll get the Gulf states to pay, because I don t want to pay. Currently, Trump is behind his rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Wisconsin   and if Cruz takes the state in its nominating contest on Tuesday, this could be a major turning point in the race for GOP nomination. If Cruz wins, he would get all of the Mid-western state s 42 delegates, making it much harder for Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates he needs to get nominated before the Republican national convention in July.

"BREAKING: STARBUCKS CEO To Step Down After Pledge To Hire 10,000 Refugees BACKFIRES The arrogance of a CEO of a major company like Starbucks, that would put his radical political opinions above the health of the company and the stockholders is astounding. The idea that Howard Schultz believed he could say Starbucks would make hiring 10,000 refugees a priority, while so many Americans are out of work, and it wouldn t harm the Starbucks brand is beyond foolish Howard Schultz, the current CEO of Starbucks, will step down from his role at the giant coffee chain next month.The move comes after his vow to hire thousands refugees in response to President Donald Trump s first travel ban appeared to hurt customer sentiment and dent their sales.Trump supporters have called for a boycott of the chain since January 29, when Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years.Schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the American Dream was  being called into question  and that  the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack. He was also a public Clinton supporter and prominent democrat, and even considered as a running mate for the Democratic nominee at one point.Almost immediately consumer perception levels took a hit as measured by YouGov BrandIndex s Buzz score, falling by two-thirds between January 29 and February 13.At the time, analysts at Credit Suisse said the coffee giant s move had a negative impact on recent sales, and could continue to hurt them in the near future.Schultz, with an estimated net worth of $3.1billion, will remain at Starbucks as executive chairman and will focus on strengthening the company s high-end coffee shops.Schultz will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, Starbucks  chief operating officer, on April 3, 2017, The Seattle Times reported.

" Costco Raises Minimum Wage For Workers As Republicans Continue To Do Nothing Costco cares more about the American workforce than Republicans do.A few years ago, Costco answered the call to help struggling workers by raising the wages of their own employees to $12 an hour, nearly a full $5 increase above the federal minimum wage that House and Senate Republicans refuse to raise for the rest of the American people.The results swiftly proved that rewarding your employees and increasing their morale is a good business decision that propels a company forward and turns it into a more competitive one.As other corporations like Walmart saw sales sink, the quarterly income of Costco soared ahead.And now Costco is betting on their employees again by raising their wages by another dollar per hour.Costco announced the wage hike on Thursday in a move that could affect a large number of the 117,000 employees who work for the company.The move not only appears to be Costco s way of rewarding their employees, it appears to also be an answer to Walmart s grudging decision to raise wages for their own workers earlier this year.By raising wages for their own employees, Costco is competing with Walmart to draw new applicants as well as retain current workers.But Costco, unlike Walmart, has always treated their employees with dignity and respect.According to the Huffington Post,Costco has a reputation for being one of the better low-wage employers. It pays slightly more than its competitors (even before the wage increase), closes its doors for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day and provides health benefits to most of its employees, even those who make an hourly wage.Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continue to refuse to raise the federal minimum wage to help all American workers across the nation, which has resulted in states and cities raising wages on their own to address the struggle minimum wage workers have faced for decades.Most recently, the state of Oregon passed the highest minimum wage in the nation. In the next few years, Oregonians can expect to make up to $14.50 per hour, which is double the federal minimum wage.Now if only Republicans would stop obeying orders from their corporate masters, perhaps the rest of the American people could get the raise they need to take better care of their families without having to struggle near as much. Alas, it will probably require replacing them with Democrats to make it happen.Featured image from Wikimedia",1
"WOW! Former Professional Boxer Wearing “Soldier Of Allah” T-Shirt Warns 3 British Activists To “Fear For Their Lives” On New Youtube VIDEO In 2015, former professional boxer Anthony Small, was been cleared of plotting to leave Britain to join Islamic State militants in Syria.Apparently it s okay to threaten the lives of British citizens as long as you re not waving an ISIS flag while you do it.Vice  Small s flourishing boxing career came to an end when he converted to Islam at the age of 24. Now known as Abdul-Haqq, he decided the sport s lifestyle was incompatible with his hardline practice of the religion and took up preaching instead.An associate of the infamous Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned organization Al-Muhajiroun, Haqq used social media to share his fundamentalist views of Islam. He regularly posted controversial videos filmed in his home, justifying IS beheadings and terror attacks such as the public killing of UK soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.Here is Anthony Small s most recent video where he targets Britain First co-founder Paul Golding former EDL leader Tommy Robinson along with conservative radio host Katie Hopkins. Keep in mind that Youtube is cracking down on conservatives for  hate speech  while this Muslim man is using Youtube to threaten the lives of 3 popular British activist. Censorship for conservatives is apparently more dangerous than death threats from professional boxers turned Muslim extremists:Haqq s views have led to multiple police raids on his house, as well as accusations of trying to join IS in the Middle East. VICE News spoke to Haqq on the run up to his arrest about police raids, Western foreign policy, and his faith. We then caught up with him again outside London s Old Bailey court after his release.Here s who  Anthony Small Boxer  really is.

"THE NEW SWEDEN: Rapes, Riots, Severed Heads, Freeloading Foreigners And Shocking Acquittals The consequences of throwing out the welcome mat for people who have no intention of obeying your rules or living in a world with morals or values  Some 30 Muslim men thought that the woman was in violation of Islamic sharia law, by being in Sweden unaccompanied by a man. They thought that she should therefore be raped and her teenage son killed.  Two Swedish citizens were convicted by a Gothenburg Court of joining an Islamist terror group in Syria and murdering two captives. Video evidence showed one victim being beheaded.  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air.    Court Chairman Ralf G. Larsson.  Sometime during the night, the victim was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. At first, the woman did not want to call the police.  She felt sorry for him [the rapist]   and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. One week after Sweden raised its terror alert level to the highest ever, the police raised another alarm   saying their weapons are simply not good enough to prevent a potential terror attack.November 4: The Swedish Immigration Service sent out a press release, saying that it had hired close to a thousand additional employees since June. The Immigration Service now has over 7,000 employees, including hourly workers and consultants   double the 3,350 employees who worked there in 2012. Most of the new recruits work with the legal processing of asylum applications, but the units dealing with receiving migrants and filing their initial applications have also expanded considerably. As if the record influx of migrants this autumn were not crushing enough, the Immigration Service also had trouble retaining its staff. Employees complain about being badly treated: they are always expected to be on call, and possibly even work Christmas Eve.November 4: Bobel Barqasho, a 31-year-old Syrian, was sentenced by Sweden s Supreme Court to 14 years in prison. Before his case reached the Supreme Court, Barqasho had been sentenced by a lower court to 9 years in prison, then acquitted by the Court of Appeals. In February 2013, Barqasho threw his wife off a sixth-floor balcony. Against all odds, the woman survived the 13-meter (about 43 feet) fall, but was badly injured. When she woke up after five weeks in a coma, her head was held together by a helmet, her face felt loose, and her teeth were gone. In the Court of Appeals, the defense managed to plant reasonable doubt about the man s guilt by claiming the woman was depressed and had jumped of her own free will] so the Court of Appeals set him free. By the time the Supreme Court pronounced its sentence of 14 years, Barqasho had disappeared. He is now being sought by Interpol.November 6: The Gr nkulla School in Alvesta closed after reports of a rape at the facility spread on social media. A Somali boy had apparently been sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl for some time. On October 17, he allegedly took his attentions a step farther, pulled the girl behind a bush and raped her. The girl s father had been unsuccessful in trying to get the school to address the problem earlier, but even after the reported rape, the school s management did not act. The boy was allowed to continue going to the school   just on a schedule different from the girl s. Her distraught parents told the news website Fria Tider:  We are being spat on because we are Swedish.  In protest against the school s management, many parents, viewing the school as having sided with the perpetrator, moved their children to other schools.November 9: Social commentator and whistleblower Merit Wager revealed on her blog that administrators at the Immigration Service had all been ordered to  accept the claim that an applicant is a child, if he does not look as if he is over 40.  A staggering 32,180  unaccompanied refugee children  had arrived during 2015 by December 1   since then another 1,130 have come   and the government finally decided to take action.If its proposition is approved by Parliament, everyone who looks adult-aged will be forced to go through a medical age-determination procedure. One of the reasons Sweden stopped doing these in the first place, was that pediatricians refused to take part in them. They said the procedures were  unreliable. November 10: A 28-year-old Iraqi man was prosecuted for raping a woman on a night train between Finland and Sweden. The man had originally planned to seek asylum in Finland, but had found the living conditions there too harsh. He had therefore taken a train back to Sweden. In a couchette (sleeping car where men and women are together), the rapist and two other asylum seekers met one of the many Swedish women whose hearts go out to  new arrivals.  The woman bought sandwiches for the men; they drank vodka. When two of the men started groping the woman, she told them to stop, yet chose to lie down and go to sleep. Sometime during the night, she was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. To the attendant s surprise, the woman did not immediately want to press charges. The court documents state:  The train attendant asked if he should call the police. At first, the woman did not want him to do so, because she did not want to put N.N., an asylum seeker, in a tough spot. She felt sorry for him  and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. The man was given a sentence of one year in prison, payment of 85,000 kronor (about $10,000) in damages, and deportation   but will be allowed to come back to Sweden after five years.November 10: An Algerian and a Syrian asylum seeker were indicted for raping a Swedish woman in Str ngn s. The men, 39-year-old from Algeria and 31-year-old from Syria, met the woman in a bar one night in August. When the woman left, one of the men followed her, pulled her to the ground, and assaulted her. Afterwards, the woman kept walking, and ran into two other men   the Syrian and another unidentified man   and was raped again. The Syrian reportedly also spit her in face and said,  I m going to f k you, little Swedish girl.  The men, who lived at the same asylum house, denied knowing each other when questioned by the police.The verdict was announced on December 1. Rapist number one was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 117,000 kronor (about $14,000) in damages, and deportation to Algeria. Rapist number two was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to four years in prison. He cannot be deported, however, because  there are currently hindrances towards enforcing deportations to Syria.  He was also ordered to pay the woman 167,000 kronor (about $20,000) in damages.November 13: A trial began against eight Eritrean men, between the ages of 19 and 26, who according to the District Court,  crudely and ruthlessly  gang-raped a 45-year-old woman. She had been waiting in a stairwell for a friend when the men invited her into an apartment. Inside, she was thrown on the floor, held down, beaten and brutally raped. When questioned by the police, she said,  It felt as if there were hands and fingers everyplace. Fingers penetrated me, vaginally, anally. It hurt very much. I could feel the fingernails.  She said she could also hear the Eritreans laughing and speaking in their own language while they raped her.  They seemed to be enjoying themselves,  she said.When two of the men started fighting over who should rape her next, she tried to flee, but one of the men hit her over the head; she fell unconscious. After coming to, she escaped out a window and was able to reach a neighbor.The District Court of Falun established that several men had taken part in the attack, but the District Attorney was unable to prove who had done what. Therefore, only one man was convicted of aggravated rape, and sentenced to five years in prison. The others were sentenced to only 10 months in prison for helping to conceal a serious criminal offense. After serving their time, the men will be allowed to stay in Sweden.November 14: The Swedish Security Service, S po, warned again of Muslim terrorists hiding among migrants. The number of individuals listed as potential security threats has tripled this year, and includes several hundred who may be ready to carry out  Paris-style  attacks.As the Immigration Service has a huge backlog in trying to register all 150,000 asylum seekers who have come to Sweden so far in 2015, there are probably also many migrants that would be considered potential security threats.November 14: Sweden s Foreign Minister, Margot Wallstr m, made yet another strange statement with diplomatic consequences. The day after the Paris attacks, in an interview with Swedish Public Television, Wallstr m was asked,  How worried are you about the radicalization of young people in Sweden who choose to fight for ISIS?  Wallstr m replied: Yes, of course we have a reason to be worried not only here in Sweden but around the world, because there are so many who are being radicalized. Here again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East, where not least the Palestinians see that there isn t any future for us [the Palestinians], we either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence. Two days later, the Swedish ambassador to Israel, Carl Magnus Nesser, was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Its spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, later told Reuters,  The Swedish Foreign Minister s statements are appallingly impudent  [She] demonstrates genuine hostility when she points to a connection of any kind between the terror attacks in Paris and the complex situation between Israel and the Palestinians. In a formal statement, the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied that Margot Wallstr m s remark had connected the Paris attacks with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Swedish Conservative (Moderaterna) Member of Parliament, Hanif Bali, sarcastically tweeted that it seemed the Foreign Minister is suffering from an  obvious case of Israel-Tourette s. November 18: The Authority for Civil Protection and Contingency Planning (MSB) warned that the asylum situation was not only  very strained,  but that things keep getting worse   and that in some parts of Sweden, the authorities can only function until the end of December. Meanwhile, the Immigration Service calculated that another 13,000 beds are needed in so-called evacuation accommodations.  The problem cannot be fully solved even if the Armed Forces help provide more housing or if the MSB could arrange more tent accommodations,  the authority wrote.The massive influx of asylum seekers has also led to native Swedes  being crowded out of the health care and social services systems,  according to the MSB.  It [the MSB] is so busy handling unaccompanied children and asylum seekers, that there simply is not enough time to tend to the everyday functions, such as healthcare and social services,  said Alexandra Nordlander, Chief of Operative Analysis at the MSB, to the daily tabloid, Aftonbladet.November 19: A fire broke out at Lundsbrunn Spa, a few weeks after plans were announced to convert the historic building into the biggest asylum-seekers  home in Sweden. According to the police, the fire was not an arson, but started in a wood-pellet stove.Many hotels and spas have transforming themselves into asylum-seekers  housing, in order to profit from lucrative deals offered by the Immigration Service. Lundsbrunn Spa, near a mineral spring, dates back to 1890; in 1817, a hospital was established on the grounds. The nearby village is home to fewer than 1,000 people, so when Lundsbrunn Spa decided to accept an offer from the Immigration Service, the village faced a doubling of its population. The owners of Lundsbrunn wrote on the Spa s website that they see the transformation from spa to asylum-seekers  home as a temporary measure.November 20: Norwegian businessman Petter Stordalen, the billionaire owner of Nordic Choice Hotels, announced that the chain s many properties in Scandinavia and the Baltic states would no longer serve their guests sausage and bacon for breakfast. The breakfast buffet of the Nordic Choice s Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg was named earlier this year the best hotel breakfast in the world by the British newspaper, The Mirror. But apparently, this award did not matter.The cause for the hotel s decision was cited as  health reasons.  The internet, however, was soon abuzz with speculation that the real reason was adaptation to Islamic dietary laws (halal). One week later, Stordalen backtracked. The reaction from hotel guests had been too strong. Many people vented their anger over the withheld bacon on Stordalen s Facebook page. Stordalen commented:  The guests have spoken. Comfort Hotels are bringing back bacon. November 23: Hassan Mostafa Al-Mandlawi, 32, and Al Amin Sultan, 30, were indicted in the Gothenburg Municipal Court, suspected of having traveled to Syria in 2013 and murdering at least two people there. The charge was terrorist crimes, (alternatively crimes against international law) and murder. Chief Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstr m, of the National Unit for Security Cases, said:  The act [was] committed with the intent to harm the state of Syria and intimidate the people, thus the classification: terrorist crimes. The hard part is to clarify fully whether these men have been part of an armed group, and acted within the frames of the armed conflict, or not. The accused men came to Sweden, one from Iraq and one from Syria, as children, but grew up in Sweden and are Swedish citizens. They traveled to Syria in 2013, and joined one of the many Islamist terror groups there. According to the prosecution, they murdered two captured workers in an industrial area of Aleppo by slitting their throats. The prosecutor wrote that,  Al-Mandlawi and Sultan have both expressed delight at the deeds. During the trial, films of the executions were shown, but both men still denied having committed the crimes. Those present in court agreed that the films were among the most disturbing ever displayed in a Swedish court. First, they show a man having his throat slit, the blood gushing before he dies. Then, the other victim s head is severed from his body, and the killer holds up the severed head to loud cheers from the others. The court s chairman, Ralf G. Larsson, told the news agency, TT:  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air. The verdict was announced December 14: Both men were convicted of terrorist crimes and sentenced to life in prison. The verdict will be appealed, the defense lawyers said.Via: Gatestone Institute",0
"BREAKING: SECRET RECORDINGS About Clinton Foundation Caused Hostility, In-Fighting Between FBI Agents Wow Peter Schweizer, author of  the chilling  Clinton Cash  book better make sure he has bodyguards wherever he goes, because his book could be the reason for the  collapse of the Clinton Crime family s house of cards .Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called  Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,  these people said.The account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment.The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn t think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn t let them pursue, they said.These details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey s disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email arrangement while she was secretary of state.On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey s disclosure of the emails.Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.WSJ   The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said.Much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the Clinton charity. The author of that book, Peter Schweizer a former speechwriting consultant for President George W. Bush was interviewed multiple times by FBI agents, people familiar with the matter said.The Clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.Mr. Schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe  patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions Hillary Clinton was making as secretary of state. As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department s criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York Mr. Capers  office didn t attend, these people said.The public-integrity prosecutors weren t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said.  The message was,  We re done here,    a person familiar with the matter said.Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to  stand down,  a person familiar with the matter said.The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.For entire story: WSJ ",0

"Snowden Laughs-off CIA Excuse of ‘Mistakenly Destroying’ Secret Torture Report 21st Century Wire says This week s announcement by the CIA that they somehow  lost  the infamous torture report has failed to impress its critics who are all but certain that the agency has destroyed, or hidden the report in order to protect all who are involved in the illegal and ultimately useless practice of torturing alleged  terrorist  suspects in order to obtain made-up information.I worked @CIA.

Word of the document being destroyed emerged despite Justice Department lawyers earlier assuring a federal court there were several copies in existence.The report was said to have been destroyed by the CIA inspector general s office in an  inadvertent  fashion. What was extremely peculiar was the fact that last summer the officials had uploaded a copy onto a computer, then accidentally deleted that.

His last was the Bundy fiasco in Oregon. Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different.

"DOJ LEADER PUTS BLAME FOR RIOTS ON…SLAVERY? It s no accident that President Obama named Vanita Gupta acting head of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. Gupta is beloved by the radical left for her militant hostility toward law enforcement officers. Here s a fantastic overview from J. Christian Adams who has intimate knowledge of what s going on at the DOJ. He worked  there and knows just how the DOJ has been turned into a politicized radical leftist entity of the Obama administration. Here s an example of that:Vanita Gupta, head of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, has told a lawyers group in Colorado that slavery and Jim Crow helped fuel the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.The last few days have seen a number of fanciful stories with the Obama administration seemingly questioning the authority of local police. I ve long maintained that the administration is nakedly seeking to federalize policing standards   but get rid of local police? No way, that sounds like something broadcast from a shortwave station in Austin, Texas. But then up steps Vanita Gupta to lend some credibility to the idea that some want to disband local police and replace police powers with the federal government. Speaking to a group of left-wing lawyers in Colorado, Gupta had this to say:The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have police or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve.There is no question that we need police in our communities.The conversation? What conversation is Gupta hearing that needs to be corrected? Who brought up the idea we might not need police? Nobody sane, for sure.If you read the entirety of Gupta s speech, you ll get a sense of what is going on in the mind of the anti-police left. Officials in this administration still think it is rational and acceptable to bring up the name Michael Brown in the context of anything other than a likely felon against whom deadly force was justifiably used. Behold Gupta:Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their deaths and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with police officers, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering.In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in officer-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration   the lack of trust in the police   is real, and it is profound.Gupta asks the question that many Americans have already asked and answered:It s worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it?To most law-abiding Americans, the idea of fleeing from the police, or worse, charging at a policeman you have already punched, is simply beyond the realm of possibility.So how did we get here? Was it a breakdown of values? Perhaps a pervasive tolerance for lawlessness? Of course not. Says Gupta:Let s start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can t be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It s in part the product of historical awareness about the role that police have played in enforcing and perpetuating (wait for it! here it comes!) slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.Read more: pjmediaRead more: pjmedia",0
" Don Lemon Is Fed Up, Yanks Guest Off The Air After Idiotic Fake News Claims (VIDEO) CNN host Don Lemon has had it with conservatives who claim things are  fake news  just because they disagree. He got that point across loud and clear when he suddenly cut a segment short rather than let a guest continue to argue that the network is pushing  fake news  stories.Lemon was moderating a panel discussion regarding the expense of Trump s weekend trips to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. But when Paris Dennard, a political analyst and commentator, finally got a chance to give his opinion things went completely off the rails. Dennard declared that the entire topic they were discussing was  fake news. The president is not breaking any laws, and he s not doing anything,  Dennard said.But Lemon wasn t having it.

Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong,  he said. This story that we re doing right now is not to intentionally deceive anyone.

The assembled gang could barely contain their glee at the prospect of damning testimony from James Comey. That all set the stage for a typical Mika Brzezinski tirade that was honestly one of the most disgusting assaults on President Trump yet. It s unhinged hate!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZoUCHs22Aw I think Trump is such a narcissist, it s possible he is mentally ill in a way and this is on the table, I said it months ago and now everyone is starting to say it like it s new, and it s ok to say. He s not well,  she said.  At the very least, he s not well. And he s so narcissistic he does not believe the rules apply to him, and that s where the ignorance label may apply because this is a man who says he can grab women anywhere because he s famous. Then something very curious happened.Scarborough looked off camera and can be heard saying,  What s that? Wow,  Then Willie Geist showed him something and the two started laughing. Then a clearly not listening Scarborough, banged the table. Stop right there,  he laughed  I need an eject button. He posted it?  Scarborough appeared to ask someone else?Brzezinski finally realized that nobody was listening to her and demanded an explanation. Nothing I have said is crazy,  she said. We ll talk about it in the break,  said Scarborough barely able to get it out through his own laugher.The show soon went to break. When it returned Scarborough joked about  keeping it in the guard rails. Brzezinski appeared to offer an explanation of her actions.  I am keeping it in the guard rails. Everything I ve said you all have thought and you know and you ve said in your own way. You re going to talk to me about a filter?  she snapped at Scarborough.",1
" Billionaire Mark Cuban Endorses Hillary, Burns Trump: He’s Gone ‘Batsh*t Crazy’ (VIDEO) Mark Cuban is much richer than Donald Trump. He is also sane enough to see that Donald Trump is a lunatic who would destroy the country. That is why Cuban has endorsed Hillary Clinton. He also devoted his Saturday afternoon campaigning for her in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.While taking the stage in front of more than 5,000 people, Cuban immediately lit into Trump, even going so far as to call the real estate tycoon turned wannabe politician a  jagoff,  which is apparently a local term to describe an incompetent jackass like Trump. Cuban said: You know what we call a person like that, you know, the screamers, the yellers, the people who try to intimidate you? You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jag-off. Is there any bigger jag-off in the world than Donald Trump? This, of course was greeted with cheers from Cuban s hometown crowd. In an interview with CNN, Cuban said that he was doing all he can to get Clinton elected because he is afraid of Donald Trump. Cuban said: Initially, I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there. But then he went off the reservation and went bats  crazy. Cuban isn t the only prominent American who thinks Trump is nuts. The Democratic National Convention stage was littered with Republicans and Independents who want Hillary elected in order to save the world from Trump. This list includes former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, and former Reagan White House Official Doug Elmets.Other Republicans really need to listen to Cuban, Bloomberg, Elmets, and other people who are trying to save this great nation from this dangerously unqualified demagogue. Swallow your pride, forget about politics, and think of the bigger picture, folks. The future of the country and the world depend on electing Hillary Clinton and defeating Donald Trump.Watch the video of Cuban s stump speech below:Featured image via video screen capture ",1

"HOW OBAMA MADE IT POSSIBLE For Protesters To Be ARRESTED And Sent To JAIL For Disrupting Trump Rallies So is anyone else wondering why the cop-hating, racist, Bernie Sanders supporter Tommy DiMassimo wasn t arrested and charged with a felony? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign rallies have become a fixture in the 2016 election season as much for the candidate s rambling speeches as for the frequent interruptions of said speeches.Demonstrators have filed in to Trump rallies across the country, shouting their anti-Trump messages and promptly being ridiculed by rally-goers and led out by law enforcement.On Saturday, Trump began to call for the arrest of protesters as he was repeatedly interrupted, raising questions about the legality of protest and whether Trump can press charges against demonstrators. So what are the answers?The short answer is, no.According to H.R. 347 (signed into law by Barack Hussein Obama in February, 2012) it is ILLEGAL under CURRENT FEDERAL to protest of any type, in an area under protection by the U.S. Secret Service.Because Donald Trump is under Secret Service Protection (as is Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders) and has been since November of 2015, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to protest at campaign rallies, and is in fact, punishable by imprisonment.Free Speech isn t covered at ANY Trump, Clinton, Sanders (or Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) rally because protests are considered to be  knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of an official Federal function. Law enforcement has simply tossed out protesters at Trump rallies, but H.R. 347 states that they could be imprisoned for up to a year for trespassing.Demonstrators are technically relegated to free speech zones much like the ones seen on college campuses.Such zones are often used to keep dissenters away from media attention, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.At a recent Trump event at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, the two designated free speech zones were not in sight of the arena where the rally was held. One was a quarter mile away.Trump can call for the arrest of whomever he wants, but he can t do the arresting.He has said, however, that he is  going to start pressing charges  against protesters as a way to intimidate them into thinking twice about demonstrating at his rallies.Based on the change to H.R. 347 in 2012, he may have grounds to press for trespassing charges against any protester who walked into the rally knowing it was a restricted area, according to the ACLU.

" Pope Francis Slams The United States For Its “Brazen” Gun Obsession Pope Francis, while appearing at the United Nation s World Food summit, slammed the United States (and the rest of the world) over its obsession with guns after the terrorist attack in Orlando left 50 people dead and another 53 wounded. Calling the obsession brazen,  the Pope chided world leaders for their  strange paradox  over the politics of food and international aid, but not guns:It makes no difference where arms come from   they circulate with brazen and virtually absolute freedom in many parts of the world.The Pope also chastised the world for numbing itself to people s pain, saying  We are bombarded by so many images that we see pain, but do not touch it; we hear weeping, but do not comfort it; we see thirst but do not satisfy it. Hours after the brutal attack, the Holy See released a strongly worded condemnation of the attacks, calling his  homicidal folly  and denouncing those responsible:The terrible massacre that has taken place in Orlando, with its dreadfully high number of innocent victims, has caused in Pope Francis, and in all of us, the deepest feelings of horror and condemnation, of pain and turmoil before this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred   We all hope that ways may be found, as soon as possible, to effectively identify and contrast the causes of such terrible and absurd violence which so deeply upsets the desire for peace of the American people and of the whole of humanity.The condemnation is exactly what the United States deserves, especially when some right wing politicians (the same one who do nothing about gun violence) proclaim that we are a Christian nation. But how can we claim to be when we allow ourselves to become so numb to the epidemic that is gun violence?Perhaps the faux-Christians should listen to the Pope (yet again) and lead by example.Featured image via Flickr",1
"JUST IN: DISGRACED DEMOCRAT HARRY REID Funneled MASSIVE Taxpayer Funds To Donor For UFO Research Through SECRET Defense Department Program The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   FOX News",0

He answers he is not protesting but is (garbled.)The Black officer says,  You can do that anywhere. You can do that on You Tube. You can do that on Twitter. Why are you here?  Posobiec s response is garbled.The Black officer then demands,  Do you have any weapons on you?  More back and forth and then the Black officer takes the Hillary sign from Polosiec and puts it on the ground and then orders his hands raised and put on his head and then to turn around.As the Black officer starts to search Polosiec he focuses on the photographer filming and orders his officers to search the photographer saying,  You okay? You wanna check him out too cuz he s like doing all the filming. Let s make sure he doesn t have anything on him. The Black officer orders the camera being taken out of the photographer s hands so he can be  properly  searched.The camera continues filming at ground level while police search and interrogate the photographer who after a while appears to sit down. Prosobiec can be seen a few feet away sitting down on the sidewalk being detained by officers.After eight minutes of being detained the Black officer says to Polosiec,  You are perfectly within your rights but I d advise you to (garbled) but if you come back (garbled,)  The lecture is hard to hear, but the Black officer claims he doesn t care about Polosiec s politics and warns him that someone might (attack) him over the sign and the that he  wouldn t come back to save you. You re free to go. The Black officer then walks over to the photographer to repeat the lecture, saying  It is not a wise move to do it here, but you can do it here. (Garbled) coming back possibly to save you. Alright? You want to go the White House or Lafayette Park if you re under 25 people that s not a problem you can still make the same statement people feel comfortable This particular venue is not a wise place. But you can do, alright you re free to go, alright? Posobiec then starts speaking to the camera that there were numerous Black Lives Matter protesters around who were not being detained by police.Posobiec vows to continue his protest at the location.This writer was a prolific conservative activist with the Washington, D.C.chapter of FreeRepublic.com during the Clinton and Bush years and never witnessed or experienced any officer with federal or D.C. police agencies ask for ID or search a peaceful protester acting and dressed similarly to Prosobiec. The late FReeper Doctor Raoul Deming would wear masks and costumes to protest Bill and Hillary Clinton and was never searched or had ID demanded in D.C. over the course of hundreds of protests.In fact D.C. has some of the most lenient laws for protesters that allow spontaneous street demonstrations that block traffic where arrests can be made only after three prolonged warnings.Prosobiec was in a public place, not blocking traffic, and was not acting belligerent or threatening. He was exercising his First Amendment rights but as the officer implied because his audience was Black people, he should take his protest elsewhere like the White House of Lafayette Park (same thing, really, as a protest locale.)via: Gateway Pundit",0
"TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER and Dartmouth Grad Says He’d Be “OK if #BetsyDeVos was sexually assaulted” After DeVos Announced Law Would Be Restored In College Sex Assault Cases Texas Civil Rights lawyer Rob Ranco is a partner at The Carlson Law Firm at the Round Rock, TX location. He is the supervising attorney for the firm s three Austin offices.When Rob isn t busy chasing ambulances or using a bullying incident his daughter allegedly faced at school to gain celebrity, he s publicly telling the world he d be okay if Betsy DeVos, a mother, grandmother and US Secretary of Education was sexually assaulted. It looks the real bully has been exposed Here s Rob Ranco s vile tweet, that he quickly deleted after it started to get traction on Twitter:This is what Rob s Twitter account looks like now:Here is a link to the archived tweet and to the responses Ranco got to his disgusting comment: https://archive.fo/xNdigRob Ranco, a partner in the Texas Carlson Law Firm was apparently referring to a decision made by Betsy DeVos, that she announced earlier in the week regarding changes that would be made to  Title IX as it relates to the unfair and unlawful way sexual assault cases are currently being tried on college campuses.Betsy DeVos spoke on Thursday, September 7, at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen. Rob offered to give up his salary before the case was even settled in an effort to get the Austin Police Department to admit guilt before the settlement. The Youtube videos showing him asking for an apology for his client have all been mysteriously scrubbed, but we have managed to locate the grandstanding video and can be seen below:Rob mentions his wife Tonia, who has her own website and Youtube channel that caters to women in his profile on Twitter.Tonia has also shut down her Twitter account, as her husband s disgusting remarks are sure to harm her business whose primary market appears to be women.Leave it to a liberal to be so filled with hate for anyone who doesn t agree with him, that he s willing to destroy his own career, and in the process, destroy his wife s career as well.Here s a video of Rob promoting himself and his excellent skills as a lawyer: ",1
" Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET) It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway. Never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe.Trump tweeted this out to stir the pot, yet again:Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2016Which then leads you to this: Hillary has bad judgment!A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 10, 2016 at 10:25am PDTLet s be clear on this. There is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened, Trump thought Libya was a female body part, so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question. He s a bully though, and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up.When every poll shows Hillary Clinton wiping the floor with Trump among women, minorities and the youth vote, he s got to do something. He s desperate, and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the Trump campaign.Bringing up Benghazi again after Clinton has been cleared again and again and again. C mon now, Donald. That s just pathetic, and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

" Paul Ryan Is So Unpopular Even 8th Graders Refuse To Pose In Pic With Him (VIDEO) House Speaker Paul Ryan is hugely unpopular, garnering only a 29 percent approval rating. Apparently, 8th graders disapprove of him, too. While on a field trip in Washington, D.C. on Friday, about half of the 8th-grade students from a South Orange Middle School refused to do a photo-op with Ryan. Instead, the nearly 100 students opted to sit in a parking lot across the street while the remaining students took part in the photo op, according to Mashable.Elissa Malespina, a school librarian and the parent one of the eighth graders who declined the photo op, said that she is proud of her son. I am so proud of my son and 1/2 the 8th grade at South Orange Middle School,  Malespina wrote on Facebook.  They went to D.C. on a field trip and toured the Capitol building. The kids had a chance to have their picture taken with Paul Ryan and over half the class choose not to, including my son! What a powerful statement. I can t take a picture with someone who supports a budget that would destroy public education and would leave 23 million people without healthcare,  Matthew Malespina, a student at the school, told The Village Green. It s not just a picture,  student Matthew told ABC News.  It s being associated with a person who puts his party before his country. I think that taking the picture represents that you agree with the same political views and I don t agree with his political views so I chose not to be in it,  eighth grader Wendy Weeks said.To some of the students, it had to do with Ryan s association with Donald Trump. I didn t want to be in [the picture] because he believes in most of what Trump believes in,  Louisa Maynard-Parisi, told The Village Green.Even though their politics might be different from Ryan s, other students decided to participate. I thought it would be interesting to see one of the nation s lawmakers in person even if I strongly disagree with many of his views,  said Alex Klint, one of the 8th-grader s said.Residents weighed in with conflicted feelings. I m sort of torn on this (although each kid has the right to make this choice),  wrote one SOMA resident.  Even though I totally disagree with everything he stands for, he is a legitimately elected official and represents our government at work. Meeting our representatives is an honor for a kid at least for what the office stands for (even if the person occupying that chair is less than honorable). And I do feel if there had been some conservative school where the kids refused to pose with President Obama, we would have been appalled by that,  the resident added.Matthew s mother told the paper,  It is his right as a citizen to do so and I commend him and his fellow students for doing so in a respectful way. Listen to the children they get it. Photo by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images.",1
"‘Vote All You Want, The Secret Government Won’t Change.’ 21st Century Wire says Those who pull the strings behind the curtain will be a lot harder to get rid of than the puppets which they control.Watch a video of this report here:Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon gave a strong warning to the American people back in 2014 that you can vote all you want   but the Secret Government won t change.Glennon s argument is that a small clique of so-called national security experts, who might otherwise be called elites from the military industrial complex, are always influencing policy makers and over-emphasising security threats.Currently, the only candidate posing a real threat to these elites appears to be Donald Trump, who is claiming he wants  to get along with foreign countries , particularly Russia.But, what is the main reason why we cannot fix this problem? Glennon says it s  the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people .Here are the key questions and responses from the interview:What evidence exists for saying America has a double government?GLENNON: I was curious why a president such as Barack Obama would embrace the very same national security and counterterrorism policies that he campaigned eloquently against. Why would that president continue those same policies in case after case after case? Why would policy makers hand over the national-security keys to unelected officials?GLENNON: It hasn t been a conscious decision. Members of Congress are generalists and need to defer to experts within the national security realm, as elsewhere. They are particularly concerned about being caught out on a limb having made a wrong judgment about national security and tend, therefore, to defer to experts, who tend to exaggerate threats. The courts similarly tend to defer to the expertise of the network that defines national security policy.Isn t this just another way of saying that big bureaucracies are difficult to change?GLENNON: It s much more serious than that. These particular bureaucracies don t set truck widths or determine railroad freight rates. They make nerve-center security decisions that in a democracy can be irreversible, that can close down the marketplace of ideas, and can result in some very dire consequences.Couldn t Obama s national-security decisions just result from the difference in vantage point between being a campaigner and being the commander-in-chief, responsible for 320 million lives?GLENNON: There is an element of what you described. There is not only one explanation or one cause for the amazing continuity of American national security policy. But obviously there is something else going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W. Bush administration.This isn t how we re taught to think of the American political system.GLENNON: I think the American people are deluded to believe that the institutions that provide the public face actually set American national security policy. They believe that when they vote for a president or member of Congress or succeed in bringing a case before the courts, that policy is going to change. Now, there are many counter-examples in which these branches do affect policy. But the larger picture is still true policy by and large in the national security realm is made by the concealed institutions.Do we have any hope of fixing the problem?GLENNON: The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people. And indifference to the threat that is emerging from these concealed institutions. That is where the energy for reform has to come from: the American people. Not from government. Government is very much the problem here. The people have to take the bull by the horns. And that s a very difficult thing to do, because the ignorance is in many ways rational. There is very little profit to be had in learning about, and being active about, problems that you can t affect, policies that you can t change.Read Mark Glennon s 2014 epic Op Ed from the Boston Globe here GET THE FULL STORY ON THE 2016 ELECTION: 21st Century Wire Election Files",1

"LONDON’S FIRST MUSLIM MAYOR BANS “Sexy Women” On Advertisements No word yet on when every female London resident will be asked to wear a hijab in public, so as not to offend the exploding Muslim population  Sadiq Khan, London s first Muslim mayor, announced Monday that  body shaming  advertisements will no longer be allowed in London s public transport. As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies. It is high time it came to an end,  Khan said.No one's confidence or body image should be undermined by ads on our transport system.

Khan was not clear in what would determine which ads would be banned, as it doesn t include all images of people in underwear or swimming clothes. Most underwear and bikini models though can be assumed to have non-average bodies. Via: Daily Caller",1
" Wife Of Arrested Russian Hacker Just Spoke Out, And Trump Is Shaking In His Boots The wife of a Russian hacker who was arrested in Spain has spoken out, confirming that her husband, Pyotr Levashov, was (allegedly) involved in hacking our election. I asked for a warrant or some papers, they said they showed them to my husband,  Maria Levashova says.  With my husband, I talked to the commissariat by phone, he said that he was shown some piece of paper in Spanish without a seal and his photo in poor quality. Something was said about the fact that the virus my husband allegedly created was related to Trump s victory in the elections. Levashov, better recognized as  Peter Severa  and  Peter of the North  in hacking circles, is well-known in the cybercrime community. Krebs on Security reports:According to numerous stories here at KrebsOnSecurity, Levashov was better known as  Severa,  the hacker moniker used by a pivotal figure in many Russian-language cybercrime forums. Severa was the moderator for the spam subsection of multiple online communities, and in this role served as the virtual linchpin connecting virus writers with huge spam networks   including some that Severa allegedly created and sold himself.Levashov is currently listed as #7 in the the world s Top 10 Worst Spammers list maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus. The U.S. Justice Department maintains that Severa was the Russian partner of Alan Ralsky, a convicted American spammer who specialized in  pump-and-dump  spam schemes designed to artificially inflate the value of penny stocks.Levashov allegedly went by the aliases Peter Severa and Peter of the North (Pyotr is the Russian form of Peter). My reporting indicates that   in addition to spamming activities   Severa was responsible for running multiple criminal operations that paid virus writers and spammers to install  fake antivirus  software. So-called  fake AV  uses malware and/or programming tricks to bombard the victim with misleading alerts about security threats, hijacking the PC until its owner either pays for a license to the bogus security software or figures out how to remove the invasive program.There is ample evidence that Severa is the cybercriminal behind the Waledac spam botnet, a spam engine that for several years infected between 70,000 and 90,000 computers and was capable of sending approximately 1.5 billion spam messages a day.In 2010, Microsoft launched a combined technical and legal sneak attack on the Waledac botnet, successfully dismantling it. The company would later do the same to the Kelihos botnet, a global spam machine which shared a great deal of computer code with Waledac.The connection between Waledac/Kelihos and Severa is supported by data leaked in 2010 after hackers broke into the servers of pharmacy spam affiliate program SpamIt. According to the stolen SpamIt records, Severa   this time using the alias  Viktor Sergeevich Ivashov    brought in revenues of $438,000 and earned commissions of $145,000 spamming rogue online pharmacy sites over a 3-year period.Severa also was a moderator of Spamdot.biz (pictured in the first screenshot above), a vetted, members-only forum that at one time attracted almost daily visits from most of Russia s top spammers. Leaked Spamdot forum posts for Severa indicate that he hails from Saint Petersburg, Russia s second-largest city.Sevara is currently in custody in Barcelona, but is subject to an extradition request by the United States. Spanish news website El Confidencial also confirms that the arrest was related to hacking that helped Donald Trump  win  the election.With Trump screaming FAKE NEWS every time new facts come out about his collusion with Vladimir Putin to take the Oval Office by any means necessary   even if it does involve some Russian hackers, an aggressive propaganda campaign, and probably a couple Russian pee pee hookers   this news is not good for him. We can fully expect a meltdown on some sort on Twitter as soon as Breitbart reports on the arrest.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",0
" WikiLeaks Has Sunk To New Journalistic Lows – They’re Bribing People For Dirt It s not illegal, but it s long been considered unethical for journalists to pay their sources. It still happens, but generally by tabloids. WikiLeaks  Julian Assange believes that his is not a tabloid, and in fact, he believes that he is so far above mainstream media sources, that it s okay for him to pay for stories, which is exactly what he s doing, trying to dig up dirt on both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Police rewards product results. So do journalistic rewards,  a spokesperson for Sunshine Press, of which Wikileaks is a project, told Huffington Post in an email.  Those who take the truth seriously leave no stone unturned to find it. As for the ethics, well, WikiLeaks breaths rarified air: Some lesser publications have poor quality control and as a consequence are not able to maintain accuracy when financial incentives are involved. Or frankly, even when they are not,  the spokesperson said, pointing to the New York Times publishing false information about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction as an example.  WikiLeaks  vetting process is strong enough not to be affected by an increase in source contributions. Wait, what? WikiLeaks has a vetting process? This is the same organization that published more than 80 strains of malware in its most recent email dump. Oh, and there s a reason they re called email dumps   WikiLeaks doesn t vet, they simply dump, leaving other journalists to sort through to find the real information. While the New York Times certainly doesn t deserve the level of respect they had before the Iraq War, I can say with certainty that they ve never infected my computer with malware.This isn t the first time WikiLeaks has paid to play. Last year, they offered $100,000 for information relating to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Earlier in the month, WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for anyone with information that might link the murder of a DNC staffer in Washington D.C. to the Hillary Clinton campaign. All they ended up doing was fueling Alex Jones-type conspiracy theorists.Assange has received a lot of criticism from those on the left, claiming that he s trying to put his thumb on the scale of our electoral process in an attempt to defeat Clinton. I m sure his claim that he s also going after Trump is a convincing cover for that, but think about it. Assange is offering $100,000. Trump could easily double or triple that to keep someone quiet. Yes, the Clintons have money, but not Trump money.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images.",1
" Kellyanne Conway Admits Comey Tapes Probably Exist But Says Trump Doesn’t Have Them (VIDEO) Does Donald Trump have tapes of his conversations with fired FBI director James Comey? Until Thursday, he said yes   but after it became apparent that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had hired a team that included former Watergate investigators, Trump changed his story.Now, he says, he was just trying to obstruct justice by using the idea that there were tapes to intimidate James Comey before he testified   a gambit that led to Comey laughing at him during a public hearing.At this point, Trump would be stupid to personally be in possession of any tapes of their conversations, but White House spokesidiot Kellyanne Conway hints that tapes may exist   Trump just doesn t keep them in his nightstand like they are a book of Adolf Hitler s speeches (yes, he kept a book of Hitler s speeches at his bedside).During an interview with CNN s Alisyn Camerota, Conway refused to say why it took 42 days for The Donald to change his story about the tapes with which he threatened the man whom he fired for requesting additional funding for the Russia investigation   but she used some very interesting wording while attempting to explain away Trump s self-made scandal. So the president made clear yesterday and in an interview aired early this morning, Alisyn, on Fox News, that he doesn t have tapes   didn t make tapes, but he left open the possibility they may exist,  Conway said, hinting that because of the  surveillance and leaking going on  the tapes might just surface. But why did we live this charade, there might be tapes or might not?  Camerota asked. There was no charade,  Conway replied. Answer definitively   there were no audiotapes?  Camerota pressed. He answered definitively yesterday,  Conway shot back. Why is he always on your timeline? Strangely, Conway nor Trump denied that tapes were made. Trump just said he personally didn t record them   which would have been a rookie move even for him   and Conway explained that Trump wasn t personally in possession of them.As Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who is leading the Russia probe, notes, that hardly clears things up.Watch it below:Featured image via screengrab",0
"BOOM! FOX NEWS LEFTIST CHRIS WALLACE Attempts Trump Smear Over Inauguration Crowd Size…FOX News’ Brit Hume Backs Up Trump On Fake News Story [VIDEO] The AP, CNN, People Magazine and other mainstream media, fake news outlets used pictures of the crowds at Obama s inauguration to compare to the crowd s at Trump s inauguration. The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W. Bush s inauguration crowds, because instead of the full-blown media assassination attempt we see against President Trump, the post-inauguration media coverage was more like an all out effort to canonize Barack Obama by our sycophant media.The media completely ignored the fact that threats of violence were being made by Soros funded groups against Trump supporters since the day after the election. They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats. They used human chains to lock visitors out of certain areas including check points where Trump supporters had to pass through in order to get to the inauguration and to the parade.Watch this husband and wife, as they are split up by human barricades. The husband manages to break through the barricade but the wife is trapped and unable to join him.

Rioters wearing black ski masks and carrying sledge hammers they used to bust out windows of banks and vehicles were roaming the streets as well.None of these threats existed prior to or during Obama s inauguration. It s pretty safe to say that angry Democrats and anarchists roaming the streets looking for trouble didn t make for the most family friendly environment. Many Trump supporters admitted they wouldn t attend the inauguration because they feared violence against them and their children. But the media just glossed over the fear factor created by the Left, and chalked it up to Trump s sudden (according to fake polls)  unpopularity. Here are the propaganda photos used by the media to discredit Trump.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/YysDewDB9N pic.twitter.com/myrXutzMpH  NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) January 21, 2017For the record, here is an actual picture that was taken during Trump s inaugural speech. The mall appears to be jam packed with Trump supporters:Chris Wallace jumped on the mainstream media train this morning and attempted to discredit Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Chris Wallace asked to have the picture comparing Trump and Obama s crowds up on the screen for the viewers to see before confronting  Reince Priebus. Priebus responded,  You re also not saying that that picture was taken before he even began speaking.  Chris Wallace freaks, and asks to have the picture put back up again (which of course doesn t change what Priebus just said).Watch:Fox News  Senior Political Analyst, who also attended the inauguration, tells a much different story than the one Wallace was trying to paint. Perhaps Wallace should have consulted with Hume, since they both work for the same network. Perhaps he should have asked about how the violent protesters affected the number of people who were actually able to make it to the inauguration. To be sure, Brit Hume was no cheerleader for Donald Trump leading up to the election, but at least he had the integrity to tell the truth about the deceitful media s attempt to prove Trump supporters have somehow magically deserted him.I was in the building at the bottom of picture on right yesterday.

" SHAME: Proof Trump Doesn’t Care About Military Veterans Donald Trump has often invoked the U.S. military and treatment of military veterans while he has campaigned as the Republican presidential nominee. But time and time again, when it comes to actions and deeds, Trump s behavior is that of someone who doesn t really care at all.The latest evidence of that comes from reporting on how he behaved while attacking the family of Captain Humayun Khan, the soldier who died protecting his unit in Iraq in 2004. Trump responded to the Khan family s speech during the Democratic Convention by attacking the family, but now we are learning just how ignorant Trump was while he was involved in this smear.New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported on Saturday that when one adviser warned Trump he had just attacked a Gold Star family, the GOP nominee responded  what s that?  The term is commonly used to refer to any family that has lost a loved one in war. The United States has officially recognized these families since 1936.[ ]Sherman also reported that Paul Manafort, who was then Trump s campaign chairman, had to explain what  Gold Star family  meant.Reporting has shown that with Trump, the Republicans have nominated an extreme narcisst, who doesn t understand any more of the wider world than he has to contend with on a day-to-day basis. Trump neither cares nor does he have the curiosity to care, even if the welfare of soldiers is the issue.His staff has been reduced to being a series of sitters for a wealthy baby.Captain Khan s father, Khizr Khan, is still involved in the 2016 election. Within the last week, Mr. Khan was on the campaign trail speaking about and advocating on behalf of the candidate he believes in and who he trusts to defend Muslims, soldiers, and Muslim soldiers: Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Flickr",1
" Thanks To Trump The U.S. Economy Lost Jobs For The First Time In 7 Years After taking office, Donald Trump has repeatedly taken credit for President Obama s economy and regularly touts jobs numbers on his Twitter timeline. Now that Trump s economy is in effect, we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing 33,000 jobs last month.While some of this can be attributed to natural disasters, Trump has also failed to pass any major legislation.Job growth in August and July was revised down, to 38,000 less than previously reported. Economists expected 75,000 new jobs instead of a 33,000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172,000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91,000 average over the past three months, showing a trend which is not in Trump s favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number, because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth, suggested the slowdown is not all weather related.After Obama took office, he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars, but he did it. Obama s economy took an upward swing, even after natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the floods which ravaged Louisiana. Throughout his campaign, Trump called Obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents, that was far from the truth.Fact: Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. Obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed 75 consecutive months of growth.The unemployment rate, however, just fell to 4.2 percent, and we re sure Trump will bring that up. Let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward North Korea. Also, if Trump manages to get the GOP tax proposal in the works, we ll see more reports like this one.But for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything Obama has done, he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in 7 years.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images.

"Georgia Judge Suspended for Comparing Attack on US Monuments to ISIS Actions 21st Century Wire says In the wake of the Charlottesville m l e, reactionary  social justice  flash mobs and assorted vigilantes have begun a campaign of attacking and destroying statues and monuments all over the country. The irrational rationale of these activists is that these historic monuments represent oppression and slavery, and therefore they must marked for ceremonial destruction. Watch this scene in Durham, North Carolina this week where, bizarrely, the hysterical mob of  liberal progressive  protesters lines up to take turns kicking the inanimate bronze statue on the ground, after it was pulled down in an impromptu ceremony. This is an emotive crowd, clearly carried away by the political hysteria: Question: Should a small violent, reactionary mob be allowed bypass any sensible public discussion or forum   thereby litigating and dictating history for the rest of the community and country?So this is really happening.

" Longtime Republican Strategist Just Cast Her Vote For Hillary This is not something that happens every day, but it s exactly what Ana Navarro did on Monday.Navarro has been a Republican since Ronald Reagan was in office, but the rise of Donald Trump as the GOP nominee has disgusted her so much that she denounced the party said she would be writing in her mother s name on her ballot rather than give a vote to Trump.But Navarro changed her mind after thinking about the close election in Florida in 2000 in which George W. Bush won by a mere 537 votes. As a Florida resident, Navarro doesn t want a repeat that send Trump to the White House.So she cast her vote for Hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on CNN.I had hoped that a week before the election, Trump would be losing Florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter. But darn it, my home state is too close to call. Florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States. I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. I thought and I thought and I thought .Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against Donald Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country.Navarro, who is an immigrant, said she voted against Trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half. On the first day of his campaign, Trump called Mexicans  rapists  and as a Hispanic immigrant that infuriated Navarro. I voted against Donald Trump for every American who looks and sounds like me,  Navarro wrote.  Because we love this country. We are proud of this country. We stand as equals in the United States of America. Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, and as a woman herself, that disgusted Navarro to her core. I voted against Donald Trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent, bearing the embarrassment, even shame, for years,  she continued.And Trump has also insulted disabled Americans, which made this election gave Navarro a more personal reason to vote against Trump.I voted against Trump because of Daniel Navarro, my severely disabled brother. My entire life, I have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability. I had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person. Trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies. In front of millions of people watching on TV. Most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior.For Navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments. In the end, Navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future, bad character won t change.She slammed Trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing. And that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat Trump. Some tell me, in 2016 we should no longer expect the president of the United States to be a role model,  Navarro wrote.  I refuse to accept that. The president of the United States has to lift us all in moments of national grief. The president of the United States has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers. That person represents us all. That person is recognized as the face and the voice for America in front of the rest of the world, and more importantly, by our children. A person supported by the Klu Klux Klan and its former Grand Wizard David Duke can never represent me. He can never be a role model for me.We each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us, that we value most. My conscience compels me to do every little thing I can to make sure a bad person is not our next president. In America, we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections.One vote is our right. One vote is our weapon. I am exercising mine against Donald Trump.Donald Trump is so toxic that many Republicans like Navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for Hillary Clinton. So much so that some red states such as Texas, Arizona, and Georgia are in play for the Democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come. That s how bad Republicans screwed up by choosing Trump as their leader.Featured Image: Twitter",1
"TRUMP BEGINS DISMANTLING Of OBAMACARE With Today’s Executive Order…Nancy Pelosi’s Response Is Hilarious! Today, President Trump came one step closer to dismantling Obamacare. He signed an executive order that would allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines. The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS for HEALTHCARE!  https://t.co/mz5fdveTVh pic.twitter.com/dDZLsKuNSe  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017Congressional Democrats said Thursday that President Trump s executive order to relax insurance rules is the latest evidence of Republican  sabotage  against Obamacare.The president signed the order that directs federal agencies to examine regulations that would make it easier for people to band together to get  association health plans  and buy more short-term insurance. Democrats quickly criticized the order as a back door to attack protections for people with pre-existing conditions and increase  junk  insurance plans. I do know it is a sabotage of the Affordable Care Act and quite frankly a disservice to the American people,  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Tuesday.She also said Trump knows  very little about healthcare legislation.   Washington ExaminerPerhaps a little trip down memory lane is in order for Nancy. Remember when Nancy Pelosi coined her most memorable line in the long list of memorable Nancy Pelosi lines?  Remember when Nancy attempted to explain the Obamacare legislation to a large audience, telling them,  But we have to pass the bill, so that you can, uh, find out what s in it. ?Even one of her most reliable media allies, David Gregory of NBC News, who was clearly on the same team as Nancy, questioned her sanity and most especially, her knowledge of what was in the Obamacare bill, following her curious remarks:We re pretty sure that most Americans are more confident in President Trump s knowledge of the benefits to Americans, once they are able to purchase insurance across state lines than they were in Nancy s ability to understand the 20,000 page Obamacare legislation.",1

"COLLEGE PROFESSOR CAUGHT ON TAPE: You Can’t Have Peace If ‘Whiteness’ Exists…Poor Whites Also Have ‘Privilege” Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible. It s like a club you belong to without asking to be part of it, Harrison said.Via: Daily Caller",1
"MULTI-MILLIONAIRE #NFL PLAYERS Take Knee During National Anthem On 9-11 To Protest “OPPRESSION” Next To Armed Forces Who Risk Their Lives For Less Than 20K Per Year [VIDEO] Does anyone else find it ironic that black multi-millionaire athletes are protesting oppression in America after 8 years of our first Black President?How much courage does it take for these multi-millionaire athletes to stand in protest against the flag our US military members defend with their lives every day? Members of our Armed Forces are making between $17,892 and $34,696 in basic pay, depending upon time served in the military and rank. But yeah we can see why you multi-millionaire punks who are treated like royalty wherever you go, are all feeling so oppressed that you need to disrespect our flag and the brave men and woman who stand on the field next to you, while you spit on their sacrifices as a way to promote Obama s Black Lives Matter legacy NFL player-activists continued to take a knee Sunday during the national anthem to protest alleged oppression of blacks in America.On Sunday in Seattle, Dolphins running back Arian Foster, wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas, and linebacker Jelani Jenkins took a knee as everyone else rose to honor America. They are taking a knee for  injustice in America,  according to civil-rights activist Shaun King.But what is the end game? How will we know when the injustice has subsided to the point so they can stand again?Perhaps when the murder rate in Chicago falls. It s currently on a record pace (512 so far this year) with most of the victims African-American. Or maybe when the black teen unemployment employment rate of 31 percent, six times higher than the national average, improves.Maybe that is what the NFL activists are waiting on, for these two oppressive situations to be fixed.Watch here:We will see. Don t hold your breath. This seems like a one-note song   it s clearly an extension of the Black Lives Matter movement, and it s about police killing a few unarmed black suspects.

"NEWSFLASH FOR OUR IMPERIAL PRESIDENT: STATES CAN REFUSE IRAN DEAL [Video] As Barack Hussein Obama tours around the country trying to convince the low information voter that the lopsided and dangerous deal he and John Kerry cut with Iran is somehow beneficial to the United States of America he may want to consider the states can shut down his deal if they so choose to act.The Obama administration has sent the Iran nuclear deal to Congress for a 60-day review provided by the Corker bill. However, President Barack Obama has pre-empted Congress by going to the UN Security Council first, which has already voted to end international sanctions and accept the deal. Furthermore, even if Congress rejects the deal, it will struggle to muster a two-thirds majority to override the president s veto.There is one effective way, however, that the Iran deal can be rejected: states and local governments can refuse to comply with it.That may come as a surprise. States and local governments do not play much of a role in foreign policy. However, they cannot be forced to implement an international treaty or agreement that is not self-executing i.e. one whose implementation requires new congressional laws.Thanks to the victory at the Supreme Court by then-Texas Solicitor General Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)96% in Medell n v. Texas (2008), it is a settled principle in constitutional law that states cannot be forced to comply with international treaties unless Congress has passed statutes giving them effect.The Iran deal stipulates (p. 15):25. If a law at the state or local level in the United States is preventing the implementation of the sanctions lifting as specified in this JCPOA, the United States will take appropriate steps, taking into account all available authorities, with a view to achieving such implementation. The United States will actively encourage officials at the state or local level to take into account the changes in the U.S. policy reflected in the lifting of sanctions under this JCPOA and to refrain from actions inconsistent with this change in policy.The  sanctions  to which the deal refers are the array of divestment laws that have been passed in recent years to prevent pension funds and contractors from providing economic benefits to Iranian companies the Iranian regime. 30 states have passed divestment laws, roughly a dozen have passed contracting restrictions, and some have passed supplemental legislation, such as a 2012 law passed in California that applies to the state s insurance industry.Many of the states that have applied harsh restrictions on Iran, moreover, are liberal  blue  states. New York, for example, maintains a blacklist of persons  determined to be engaged in investment activities in Iran. As the state government explains further:  Once an entity appears on the list, it will be considered a non-responsive bidder/offerer and prohibited from entering into contracts with New York State or local governments.  That includes companies that are not Iranian themselves, but do business with Iran.The Iran deal lifts sanctions on some companies that appear on New York s blacklist. However, the state restrictions remain in force.The Iran deal obligates the federal government to take  appropriate steps  to cancel state and local restrictions, and requires the government to refrain from further sanctions in the future. The truth is that the federal government has no constitutional authority to do so.Divestment laws and contracting restrictions can remain in place at the state and local level until they are superseded by federal statute. The language of the Iran deal itself is not enough to constitute such statutory authority, even if the Iran deal does pass by failure to override Obama s veto.If the states want, they can add new sanctions and restrictions on Iran perhaps to replace those that the federal government is lifting, such as restrictions on Iranian engineers studying nuclear technology at American universities.The Iran deal specifies that Iran will treat  an an imposition of new nuclear-related sanctions, as grounds to cease performing its commitments.  That paragraph (27) deals with federal sanctions, but is written vaguely.That leaves great power in the states  hands to trigger the deal s collapse or force Obama to re-negotiate.Via: Breitbart News",0
"PARTY CORRUPTION: Clinton Campaign Directly Tied to Disgraced DNC Consultant 21st Century Wire says A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close.   MELTDOWN    The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  POLITICAL BOMBSHELL    Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. (Image Source: Lockerdome)Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas. Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera   he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials.  DNC SCANDAL    Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard)Creamer s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics, potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability.The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here s a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show. The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: In the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. I ll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,  Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled From time to time I get the questions in advance. Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now, as well as a CNN contributor.In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following, while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe. This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons.The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates objected  to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week   something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case.According to a report filed by Zero Hedge, a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik, the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin, Clintion s closest aide.Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, over his alleged foreign business connections.Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news: In 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort s firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash s company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say.That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia   so far, there s nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time.Watch this space   as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.More from LifeZette below   OUT OF CONTROL?

Russia collusion was with Dems in 2016 election. #MAGA #DTS pic.twitter.com/4OnuUx01lB  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) October 25, 2017The Washington Post just revealed:The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS s research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary. The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.Fusion GPS gave Steele s reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS s role.The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign s possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier.THANKS TO TRUMP S PRESSURE, THE TRUTH CAME OUT:Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should  immediately release who paid for it. Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. Spokesmen for the Clinton campaign and the DNC had no immediate comment.Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a  client-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS s bank records.People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost.Read more: WaPo",0
" WATCH: Racist Republican Congressman Steve King Displays A Confederate Flag On His Office Desk It doesn t get any clearer than this that Iowa Rep. Steve King is a racist.During a story about King introducing Sarah s law, a program that allows parents to check if someone around their child has ever been convicted of sexual offenses against children, cameras busted the Republican openly displaying a Confederate flag on his office desk.Here s the video via YouTube. The flag can be seen at the 26 second mark.This pretty much confirms that King is a racist who fantasizes about secession. After all, he is a vicious critic of Black Lives Matter and has always hated President Obama, whom he directly blamed for the Dallas shootings in a post on Twitter.#DallasPoliceShooting has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama Officer Crowley. There were others.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) July 8, 2016Furthermore, King tried to block the addition of Harriet Tubman, a former slave who escaped and became a prominent abolitionist who helped other slave gain their freedom via the Underground Railroad, to the $20 bill in defense of slave-holder Andrew Jackson, who is going to be moved to the back.King claimed that putting Tubman on the $20 bill is racist while he tried to portray his effort as  unifying This is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories, and he s divided us on the lines of groups,  King said.  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine s unifying. It says just don t change anything. King is also a fan of secession. When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union last month, he cheered the vote on Twitter. Congratulations to UK, especially @Nigel_Farage & UKIP, for your noble & farsighted national decision to #BreExit. WesternCiv can be saved.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) June 24, 2016Texas conservatives also cheered the decision and have used it to push their own secession movement.Democratic candidate Kim Weaver, who is challenging King for his seat, told the De Moines Register, Like a lot of Iowans, I m disgusted by his gross insensitivity to the millions of Americans for whom that flag is a symbol of racism and division, and I join them in calling on Mr. King to remove it immediately. Even Iowa s GOP governor opposes King s display of the Confederate flag because Iowa was a Union state during the Civil War.Indeed, 76,242 Iowa men fought against the Confederacy. Iowans fought bravely with distinction at the Battle of Wilson Creek in Missouri and many are buried at Vicksburg National Cemetery. King s support of the Confederate flag is an insult to their memory and the memory of the 13,000 Iowans who died trying to defeat the Confederacy. It s also disgraceful to the Iowans who were killed by Confederate bushwhackers who repeatedly raided the southern part of the state during the war.Iowa heavily backed Abraham Lincoln and the Union, so Steve King s display of an enemy flag is totally offensive, especially since he is supposed to be a United States congressman.Featured Image: Screenshot",1

" Paul Ryan Has A Request For Donald Trump, And Trump’s Campaign Won’t Like It AT ALL House Speaker Paul Ryan sold his soul the day he endorsed Donald Trump to be president of the United States. It was clear that he was just being a spineless, cowardly weasel when he did so, as he did it under cover of a big policy speech by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Ever since then, Ryan s relationship with Trump has been frosty at best, and they have never appeared on stage together.During a weekly press briefing, Ryan got the one question everyone has been asking: Why hasn t Donald Trump released his tax returns? This is especially pressing right now, as Newsweek just printed a damning story that shows that should Donald Trump become president, the Trump Organization s rather dubious web of international ties would endanger the national security of the United States of America. With that revelation, it is even more imperative than ever that the American electorate sees Trump s tax returns. Hell, even George W. Bush s ethics lawyer said that these ties are a, quote,  serious problem. Therefore, Ryan finally caved and said Trump s returns need to be made public. First, he referenced his own releasing of his taxes when he ran for Vice President: I did release my returns. I ll defer to Donald Trump as to when he thinks the appropriate time to release his returns. I know he is under audit, and he has an opinion on when to release those and I ll defer to him on that. He then hedged, though, because he is a coward who is afraid of upsetting Trump s supporters, and said: I released mine. I think he should release his. I ll leave it to him when to do it. No, Speaker Ryan, you need to get forceful with this. We need the returns NOW. With all of the shadiness surrounding Trump s business dealings and ties to nefarious characters around the world, this is vital information for the nation and world to know. Trump is trying to run the clock out on this one, to keep the voting public from knowing just what he gets up to. Do your job, and DEMAND Trump s tax returns.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0

"CHARLES BARKLEY Says Anyone Who Criticizes Obama Is A Racist…Gay Rights More Important Than Religious Freedom In America [VIDEO] On March 20, 2016 Barkley had this to say about Obama:  Listen, you people in America who are upset that President Obama did a [March Madness NCAA Basketball] bracket   why don t ya ll just go say you don t like him because he s black. He continued,  Cut through all the BS   don t say he take too many vacations   just say,  We don t like him because he s black.'  Via: TMZLess than a month ago, Charles Barkley said anyone who disagrees with Obama does so because they are discriminating against him because he is black. And now, according to the all-knowing former NBA star, anyone who believes the religious rights of business owners should be protected is discriminating against gays. What about white Christians Charles? Are they entitled to any protections, or do you have to fall into some sort of minority category in order to have any rights or protections in the new progressive America? Charles Barkley wants to move All-Star game due to 'Anti-LGBT' lawhttps://t.co/P0hK7FpJFo  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 8, 2016Retired professional basketball player and NBA analyst Charles Barkley has been bringing politics into this year s March Madness tournament left and right.His latest comments center around Indiana s Religious Freedom Act, the left s latest punching bag. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable to me,  Barkley said Friday in a statement released through his agent to USA Today.  As long as anti-gay legislation exists in any state, I strongly believe big events such as the Final Four and Super Bowl should not be held in those states  cities. The Religous Freedom Act prevents Indiana state and local governments from  substantially burdening a person s ability to exercise their religion   unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it,  according to the Indianapolis Star.The legislation, which will take effect July 1, makes no specific mention of sexual orientation, but it was quickly dubbed  anti-gay  by opponents.Barkley also turned the popular basketball tournament political when he made comments about President Obama s March Madness bracket. He said that people were criticizing Obama for filling out a bracket because  he s black.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",1
"NUTTY LEFTY Breaks Into TRUMP’S Mar-A-Lago Club…Vandalizes With Bananas PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)   A woman is being charged with sneaking onto President Donald Trump s private Mar-a-Lago club shortly before his inauguration and smearing bananas on cars.Palm Beach, Florida, police say in a report released Monday that 48-year-old Kelly Weidman also typed a profanity about Trump on a Mar-a-Lago computer and moved outside some ballroom balloons a few hours before Trump was sworn-in Friday.She was confronted by security guards, who called police. She allegedly told officers she wanted to be arrested because no one was paying attention to her claim of being cyber attacked. She was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and released.Because Trump wasn t at the ritzy club, the Secret Service wasn t involved.No one answered a phone number listed for Weidman on Monday and court records didn t list an attorney.VIA: WPTV",1
" Trump Just Accidentally Gave America The Greatest Reason Not To Vote For Him Donald Trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him, and instead he just handed the rest of America a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected.At a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or not, he told his followers that if he loses, he ll go into hiding, never to be seen again.Signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another Republican should he lose the nomination, Trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor. Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says,  I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. So Trump made his supporters a promise: I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans. He s hated by young people. He s hated by the one group the GOP could always count on, white men (yes, really).He s the most hated politician in three decades. The last person who came close? Richard Nixon post-Watergate. Even Dick Cheney   at the lowest moments of the Bush years   was hated by (slightly) fewer people.That s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant Donald Trump never shows his face in front of a camera again. It s hard to imagine a better way Donald Trump could Make America Great Again than that. And Trump just promised to do it.The stakes in this election, already very high, just became: President Trump vs. Trump never being seen again. Pray America makes the right choice.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",1
"WOW! HOUSE INTELLIGENCE Chair CONFIRMS Trump Was Correct…Trump Transition Team WAS Surveilled By Obama [VIDEO] House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) confirmed Wednesday that members of President Donald Trump s transition team were surveilled by the Obama administration.Nunes told reporters that the surveillance appeared to be incidental and legal. I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,  Nunes said.  Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or not apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.

" Crowd Erupts In Boos When Military Mom Asks Pence About Trump’s Khan Statements A Mike Pence rally in Nevada turned ugly when a military mom asked the vice presidential candidate about Donald Trump s recent statements regarding Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala. Rally goers viciously booed her and demanded to know why she was even there in the first place.The woman, who was later identified as identified as Catherine Byrne. began by explaining that her son is serving in the Air Force. Of course, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. But when she continued, their mood quickly did an about face: Time and time again, [Donald] Trump has disrespected our nation s armed forces and veterans. And his disrespect for Mr. Khan  That was as far as she got before the crowd became vicious, booing her so fiercely that they drowned out her words. Why are you here?  one woman screamed angrily. But Byrne continued to speak You ve got a son in the military, how do you tolerate this disrespect? Pence finally stepped in after about 10 seconds and began to hush the crowd. That s OK,  he said. Pence then reiterated what he and said when he was confronted by protesters in Ohio last week: That s what freedom looks like, and that s what freedom sounds like. Pence then praised Capt. Humayun Khan and his family. Khan was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States military. His parents made headlines when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Republican nominee responded to Khizr Khan s criticism of his bigoted policies by attack them. Capt. Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family,  he said.  The story of Capt. Khan is an incredibly inspiring story. But in the next breath, Pence defended Trump. I have never been around someone more devoted to the armed forces of this country,  Pence said of Trump.  There is no one more devoted to the veterans in this country. One of the people booing Byrne was Denise Martinez. She said that she admired how Pence had dealt with the tense situation. I thought he handled it really, really well,  she said.  Looking back, I think I would ve taken the high road. He handled it the right way, the way I wish Trump would have,  she added.Barbara Weisenthal was another woman who was booing. In her opinion, Khizr Khan had no right  to speak about Trump the way he did at the DNC and his entire speech  was almost like slander. Weisenthal added that the rally was  probably not the best place  for Byrne to ask her question.Jack Christenson, who is a veteran himself, argued that even though Byrne had the right to speak out thanks to the Constitution, she didn t have the right  to violate everyone else s rights  by asking a question of a person running to be vice president.Roen Horn said Byrne was claiming that Trump was  somehow insulting the veterans,  which he said was  a bunch of crap. She was politicizing the veterans,  he said.  She had an agenda. Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images ",0
"HILLARY CLINTON CRONYISM VIOLATES FEDERAL RULES: Chelsea’s “Best Friend” Given Millions In Contracts With The Feds…A New Low! Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to arrange Pentagon and State Department consulting contracts for her daughter s friend, prompting concerns of federal ethics rules violations.Clinton in 2009 arranged meetings between Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, a friend of Chelsea Clinton and head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group, with Pentagon officials that involved contracting discussions, according to emails from Clinton s private server made public recently by the State Department. Clinton also tried to help Deal win a contract for consulting work with the State Department s director of policy planning, according to the emails.Deal is a close friend of Chelsea Clinton, who is vice chair of the Clinton Foundation. Emails between the two were included among the thousands recovered from a private email server used by the secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Chelsea Clinton has described Deal as her best friend. Both Clintons attended Deal s 2011 wedding.Here s a little blurb from the fashion rag WWD on an event the two attended together: This story first appeared in the October 20, 2011 issue of WWD. Wearing a short-skirted black Chanel dress, Clinton began by crediting her longtime friend Jacqueline Newmyer.  Jackie invited me to see  Romeo and Juliet,  she said, remembering back to 1995.  The next time, I got my parents to come. And I have been coming here ever since.  That historic family night out occurred three years later. She and her parents arrived at the theater two days after Christmas 1998 and a week after the House of Representatives voted to impeach her father. The show they saw? None other than  Twelfth Night,  a tale of magical transformation. Talk about Freudian.Later, at the after party, Clinton elaborated on the nearly 20-year friendship with Newmyer, putting to lie the old Harry Truman quip  If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.   Jackie and I are still best friends,  said Clinton, who met Newmyer her first year in Washington at the Sidwell Friends School.  She was in my wedding, and I was in hers.  Clinton, 31, continues to work on snagging her Oxford Ph.D. while working at New York University and with the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Newmyer, 32, is the president of the Long Term Strategy Group, a military research firm in Cambridge, Mass.Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest.Specifically, the Code of Federal Ethics states that government employees  shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.  Pentagon ethics guidelines also call for avoiding actions that would create even the appearance of improper behavior or conflicts of interest.The Clinton email exchanges with Deal between 2009 and 2011 were among tens of thousands of private emails made public by the State Department under pressure from Congress and the public interest law firm Judicial Watch.Read more: WFB",1
" Trump’s Klan Endorsement Generates Epic Newspaper Front Page (IMAGE)  The NY Daily News, one of the tabloid newspapers that also happens to be a hometown publication for Donald Trump, has produced another cover mocking the fascist billionaire.Appearing on the front of Friday s newspaper is a Ku Klux Klansman in full dress, announcing an endorsement of Trump s presidential career.An early look at tomorrow's front page:TRUMP FOR PREZ   Ex-KKK leader: Donald just like us! https://t.co/kVep9MWIZz pic.twitter.com/ls4iIFxlsn  New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) February 26, 2016The cover is a reference to the announcement from infamous former KKK leader David Duke that he is fully backing Trump s campaign. Duke told listeners to his underground radio show that it is the duty of white supremacists to vote for the current Republican presidential front runner. Voting for these people, voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage,  Duke said on the David Duke Radio Program. BuzzFeed News first reported the comments. I m not saying I endorse everything about Trump. In fact, I haven t formally endorsed him. But I do support his candidacy, and I support voting for him as a strategic action. I hope he does everything we hope he will do. Duke also told his fellow white supremacists that they need to go out and volunteer for Trump, noting: And I am telling you that it is your job now to get active. Get off your duff. Get off your rear end that s getting fatter and fatter for many of you everyday on your chairs. When this show s over, go out, call the Republican Party, but call Donald Trump s headquarters, volunteer. Trump has consistently appealed to bigotry in his campaign. He first launched his effort by calling Mexicans rapists, then proceeded to advocate for registering Muslims and barring them from entering the United States. Trump himself has also been caught several times using his Twitter account to amplify the messages of white supremacists and other racists, who are loudly backing his campaign online and attacking his critics.Featured image via Flickr",0
"Trump’s First Congressional Speech Stuns Media Detractors – Stock Markets Rally 21st Century Wire says Last night, an embattled President Donald Trump gave his first address to Congress. The results surprised even his fiercest critics. He became president of the United States in that moment, period,  said Trump critic and CNN commentator Van Jones.  That was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period. Make no mistake, it was a house divided, but it seems that the White House achieved its chief objective   to stop the public relations hemorrhaging, for now at least.One unusual aspect of this Trump speech   reports suggest that the President actually spent the day of his first address to a joint session of Congress revising and rehearsing his speech.It seemed to have paid off.

"12 MUSLIM MIGRANTS GANG RAPE 13 YR OLD GIRL…Muslim Lawyer Blames Girl Tell us again Barack, about the  poor widows and orphans  who are being strategically placed in our small towns and communities across America. With all the rape and violence being committed by these  refugees,  why in the world would we welcome these savage animals into our country? Oh that s right to vote for Democrats A Muslim councilor has admitted that some feel as though  it takes two to tango  as 12 men were jailed for gang-raping a 13-year-old white girl in West Yorkshire.The gang of men from Pakistani origin were jailed for a total of 143 years at Bradford Crown Court today, for 13 months of horrendous abuse of the British white girl in 2011 and 2012. However, the Councillor for Keighley Central, where the abuse took place, has admitted that some members of the community felt  it takes two to tango  and that the girl may have  played her part .Zafar Ali, who has been a member of the Keighley Mosque for decades believes that some of the men may have attended in the past, but said the Muslim community totally condemn their actions.He told MailOnline:  Everyone now believes that justice has been done, we need to move forward and it is a lesson for the whole Muslim community. There are a few bad apples but this does not represent the Muslim community as a whole and any sensible Muslim totally condemns these actions. Eleven of the men were today jailed for rape and a twelfth man was jailed for sexual activity with a child under 16 today at Bradford Crown Court, but the ringleader has fled to Bangladesh.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that the men jailed were of Pakistani origin.The sentences come as it emerged that:Ringleader Ahmed Al-Choudhury who facilitated most of the offences is believed to now be living in Bangladesh after fleeing at the beginning of the investigation in 2012 After the sentencing, Kris Hopkins, Conservative MP for Keighley spoke out against the  sick model of organized groups of  Asian men  grooming young white girls , but said there are more women out there who need justice.He said the sentenced were vindication for controversial comments he made during a parliamentary debate in 2012, claiming that organised groups of Asian men were  going around raping white girls .However, he claims that even today he has been  lambasted  for even mentioning that the men are Asian when talking about the sentences.He told MailOnline:  There are sexual offenders who are white, but the fact is this particular model is all  Asian men  and all the victims were white. I was attacked in 2012 and today, when these men were convicted, the community was silent. You have to ask yourself why these men get away with this behavior. There is broader issues around the way women are treated in that community, there are hundreds if not thousands of women who live behind that door and have no voice. In a Commons speech three years ago, Mr Hopkins caused controversy three years ago when he suggested Muslim men were  fundamentally  sexist towards women.Judge Roger Thomas QC condemned the  insolent and disrespectful behaviour  the accused showed in court which he said reflected their treatment of their victim.They showed her no shred of decency or humanity when as a vulnerable child she so needed care and understandingJudge Roger Thomas QC told them:  The attitudes of the majority of you have so clearly demonstrated to these proceedings has been contemptuous, disrespectful and arrogant on a scale that I have hardly seen before in many years of practice in criminal law.  Exactly the same attitude to the 13/14 year old girl who you all sexually abused and exploited for your own selfish gratification. He added:  None of these defendants had any concern for the victim. They were totally uninterested in her welfare and what damage they were causing her. The victim clearly demanded pity and understanding but their view of her was heartless and demeaning. They saw her as a pathetic figure who had no worth and who served no purpose than to be an object that they could sexually misuse and cast aside. Via: Daily Mail ",0

" We’re Officially At The ‘My Wife Is Hotter Than Your Wife’ Part Of The Election (TWEETS) Almost every day, this year s presidential election is becoming more and more like a high school election, or rather middle school, at least on the Republican side.

The only thing left, really, would be a food fight at the next debate.Now, we ve officially gotten to the  my wife is hotter than your wife  part of the election.It all started when an anti-Trump/pro-Cruz group had an ad in Utah featuring Melania Trump in her GQ spread where she was pretty much naked. Trump, and actually rightfully so, was less than pleased. However, he responded in the Middle School fashion that we ve now become accustomed to seeing and went directly after Ted Cruz s wife Heidi, claiming he ll  spill the beans  on her.Taking this ridiculousness a step further, Trump has now retweeted an image that quite honestly screams,  look at my wife, she s so much more attractive than your wife.

"MN Taxpayers To Pay Rent For African Refugees While Visiting Homeland…Freeing Them From Financial Burden We re just wondering if the state of MN has ever considered giving US veterans the same consideration? Or is this an exclusive offer given to African refugees because they contribute so much to our economy or wait do they? In the USA, 91.4% of Muslim  refugees  are on food stamps and 68.3% are taking Cash Welfare. Here s a chart to show how much refugees are contributing to the overall economy. Via: Senator Jeff SessionsThe Minneapolis Housing Authority passed legislation this week that will allow migrants to skip their monthly rent in Minnesota when they travel back home to East Africa.The move was sought by local East African immigrants. Immigrants traveling for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship which will reduce their rent to $75 a month while they are gone. The Star Tribune reported:Public housing residents in Minneapolis will no longer need to pay their normal monthly rent when travel abroad erases their income, a change particularly sought by East African immigrants.The board of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority approved this week reverting to its previous policy of collecting only minimal rent during extended absences. The change takes effect once approved by federal housing officials, which is expected by year s end.Abdi Warsame, a City Council member, told the board that the policy in place for the past five years works a particular hardship on elderly East Africans who must save for long periods if they want to visit their homelands. He said that many receive federal Supplemental Security Income, which is halted when the recipient is outside the United States.Yet the policy required people to keep paying rent, which is income-based. Travelers gone for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship, which meant that they paid the minimum $75 monthly rent during their absence, but were required to make up the difference between that and their normal rent over the next year or two.

" WATCH: Joy Reid OWNS Trump In Less Than 30 Seconds For Claiming To Be More Popular Than Obama Joy Reid rained on Donald Trump s parade on Sunday morning, and it was glorious.Earlier in the morning, Trump declared on Twitter that his poll numbers are better than President Obama s and posted about how Rasmussen, a conservative leaning polling firm, has his approval rating at 50 percent.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That s higher than O s # s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017Well, AM Joy host Joy Reid quickly destroyed Trump with a smile and some snark. Trump also tweeted about his poll numbers this morning, citing a new poll that puts his approval rating at 50 percent and saying that s higher than O s numbers,  Reid said before pointing out that Trump is obsessed with Obama.  Obsessed with President Obama much?  she continued.Reid then noted that other polls have Trump s approval rating much lower than Rasmussen. In fact, his rating is the lowest in history. The only poll showing Trump at 50 percent was Rasmussen, which Reid trashed. See if you can spot the outlier,  she asked the audience.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald had better see someone quickly about that burn.But it s even worse for him because his claim is not even close to being accurate. As it turns out, President Obama s approval rating on June 18, 2009 was 55 percent. And the polling firm that reported that finding happens to be Rasmussen, the same polling firm Trump is bragging about now. And last time I checked, 55 is still bigger than 50. That means Trump s claim that he has a higher number than Obama is totally false.Reid is right about Trump being obsessed with President Obama. Trump has tried to destroy Obama s legacy at every turn and he is constantly claiming to be a better president even though he has been a complete disaster for this country. Trump legislative record is laughable since the only bills he signs are minor ones that designate buildings and other little things that don t really matter. He has not signed a single piece of major legislation yet, and he is been in office over 100 days already.Mostly, he has been signing executive orders, which Trump and conservatives repeated whined about Obama doing. Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than Obama ever did. Furthermore, Trump is also on pace to take more vacation days and play more rounds of golf in a single year than Obama ever did.Trump is an embarrassment to this nation and his poll numbers are only going to get worse once his supporters begin to truly realize that they have been duped.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

" Conservative Commentator Uses Nancy Reagan’s Death To Launch Racist Attack On Michelle Obama (TWEETS) When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation. But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.  AAmom (@AVD911) March 6, 2016And another @DebbieSchlussel you're actually racist scum  dmbrandon!! (@juiceDiem) March 6, 2016While this person made a rather helpful suggestion.@DebbieSchlussel let some light into your hateful heart   Chuck Daly (@ChuckDaly) March 6, 2016Former Will and Grace star Debra Messing drew attention to Schlussel s tweet, condemning it openly.Shame on you https://t.co/GPNI7EbqBs  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 6, 2016So Schlussel spent the rest of Sunday hate-tweeting Messing (getting no response) for the crime of speaking out against racism.

" WATCH: Patriot’s ‘Stand For Freedom’ Thwarted By Evil Socialist Ceiling Fan (VIDEO) One man s  stand for freedom  ended disastrously when he forgot to look up. YouTuber  Latherland  uploaded a clip on Thursday that shows a man attempting to make a patriotic, inspiring video that will convince the world to stand up to the tyrannical United States government. You know what?  the unidentified man says in front of a backdrop of a whirring ceiling fan.  It s about time our people took a stand for freedom. Inspiring. The gentleman emphasizes his point by standing up on his bed, but apparently forgets the fan buzzing above him. So you know what?  he says as he rises.  As a patriot, I m going to take a motherf*cking F*ck, sh*t,  Our hero yelled as he bravely smashed his head into something hard.  God damn it. F*ck. The brave American then turned the camera off as he groaned in pain.For some reason, stupid people love to showcase their love of freedumb every chance they get, usually with some sort of moronic stunt   like the American Flag-clad, Confederate flag-waving  Murikan who set himself on fire like a bombastically stupid Tibetan monk while showing off his flag-waviness for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, or whatever the f*ck this is.Stupidity kills, and conservatives are full of it. According to the mystical art in which they don t believe, science, there is a strong link between conservatism and low IQ. In other words, they are exactly the sort of people who would not stop to think that ceiling fans make  boom  and  ouch. Watch this trainwreck below:Featured image via screengrab",0

But I don t think you tell idealistic people   particularly young people   that they ve bought into a false promise. The audio, which was released by the Washington Free Beacon, comes just three weeks after Clinton faced backlash for calling millions of Americans supporting Donald Trump  deplorables. The recording, which is from a fundraising event in February, catches the Democratic nominee calling Sanders  supporters  children of the Great Recession  that are  living in their parents  basement.

"“DIRTY JOBS” HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist  Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.",0

Thomas Wictor dissected the signature and the validity of her story on Twitter:Beverly Young Nelson said Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore wrote a message in her yearbook in December 1977 that said, ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'""She said he signed it, ""Roy Moore, D.A."" https://t.co/aluJzQsv15 pic.twitter.com/esjGd1ssd9  CNN (@CNN) November 13, 2017Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It's DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.

" Trump Laughably Claims He Knows More About Cyber Attacks Than The CIA Donald Trump is now saying that he knows more about computer hacking than the experts at the CIA and our other intelligence agencies.During an interview with the New York Times prior to a New Year s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, Trump once again defended Russia and Putin by questioning the validity of an assessment by the intelligence community concluding that Russia meddled with our political process. I just want them to be sure because it s a pretty serious charge,  Trump said before invoking the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  If you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. So I want them to be sure. I think it s unfair if they don t know. But that s not exactly true. Former CIA official Tyler Drumheller said in 2006 that the Bush Administration ignored intelligence concluding that Iraq did NOT have weapons of mass destruction. When presented with the assessment, Bush and his team refused to believe it and went to war in Iraq anyway.So when Trump blames the intelligence community for getting WMDs in Iraq wrong, it s inaccurate. They actually got it right. Bush was the one who was wrong by ignoring them.Trump didn t stop there, however. Just like when he claimed to know more about ISIS than our generals, Trump claimed to know more about hacking than the experts at our intelligence agencies. And I know a lot about hacking,  Trup continued.  And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation. He basically said the same thing on Twitter in December.Unless you catch  hackers  in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn t this brought up before election?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016So apparently, Trump fancies himself a military genius and a computer expert.Seriously, Trump needs to stop pretending he knows things that he doesn t really know. The reality is that he has never served in our military. He s an expert at draft-dodging but he is certainly no expert on ISIS. And while he clearly knows how to use social media, Trump definitely does not know how to hack a computer. HOur intelligence agencies know how to trace hacks because hacking leaves traces and signatures that can be used to determine where the hack originated.That s how we know Russia hacked us. It s incredibly dangerous for Trump to claim that he knows all this stuff and that he knows more than the experts. Because then he can undermine the experts all the time and his gullible supporters will believe him instead of the facts, which is what Trump has been doing for over a year and a half now. If Trump knows more about something, it s being a con artist. He s been doing that for decades so he s total pro.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1
"NEWSFLASH FOR OUR IMPERIAL PRESIDENT: STATES CAN REFUSE IRAN DEAL [Video] As Barack Hussein Obama tours around the country trying to convince the low information voter that the lopsided and dangerous deal he and John Kerry cut with Iran is somehow beneficial to the United States of America he may want to consider the states can shut down his deal if they so choose to act.The Obama administration has sent the Iran nuclear deal to Congress for a 60-day review provided by the Corker bill. However, President Barack Obama has pre-empted Congress by going to the UN Security Council first, which has already voted to end international sanctions and accept the deal. Furthermore, even if Congress rejects the deal, it will struggle to muster a two-thirds majority to override the president s veto.There is one effective way, however, that the Iran deal can be rejected: states and local governments can refuse to comply with it.That may come as a surprise. States and local governments do not play much of a role in foreign policy. However, they cannot be forced to implement an international treaty or agreement that is not self-executing i.e. one whose implementation requires new congressional laws.Thanks to the victory at the Supreme Court by then-Texas Solicitor General Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)96% in Medell n v. Texas (2008), it is a settled principle in constitutional law that states cannot be forced to comply with international treaties unless Congress has passed statutes giving them effect.The Iran deal stipulates (p. 15):25. If a law at the state or local level in the United States is preventing the implementation of the sanctions lifting as specified in this JCPOA, the United States will take appropriate steps, taking into account all available authorities, with a view to achieving such implementation. The United States will actively encourage officials at the state or local level to take into account the changes in the U.S. policy reflected in the lifting of sanctions under this JCPOA and to refrain from actions inconsistent with this change in policy.The  sanctions  to which the deal refers are the array of divestment laws that have been passed in recent years to prevent pension funds and contractors from providing economic benefits to Iranian companies the Iranian regime. 30 states have passed divestment laws, roughly a dozen have passed contracting restrictions, and some have passed supplemental legislation, such as a 2012 law passed in California that applies to the state s insurance industry.Many of the states that have applied harsh restrictions on Iran, moreover, are liberal  blue  states. New York, for example, maintains a blacklist of persons  determined to be engaged in investment activities in Iran. As the state government explains further:  Once an entity appears on the list, it will be considered a non-responsive bidder/offerer and prohibited from entering into contracts with New York State or local governments.  That includes companies that are not Iranian themselves, but do business with Iran.The Iran deal lifts sanctions on some companies that appear on New York s blacklist. However, the state restrictions remain in force.The Iran deal obligates the federal government to take  appropriate steps  to cancel state and local restrictions, and requires the government to refrain from further sanctions in the future. The truth is that the federal government has no constitutional authority to do so.Divestment laws and contracting restrictions can remain in place at the state and local level until they are superseded by federal statute. The language of the Iran deal itself is not enough to constitute such statutory authority, even if the Iran deal does pass by failure to override Obama s veto.If the states want, they can add new sanctions and restrictions on Iran perhaps to replace those that the federal government is lifting, such as restrictions on Iranian engineers studying nuclear technology at American universities.The Iran deal specifies that Iran will treat  an an imposition of new nuclear-related sanctions, as grounds to cease performing its commitments.  That paragraph (27) deals with federal sanctions, but is written vaguely.That leaves great power in the states  hands to trigger the deal s collapse or force Obama to re-negotiate.Via: Breitbart News",1

But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton,  Koch said, explaining that for Hillary to be a better President than the entire Republican field, she would have to be a gigantic hypocrite who can be bought and sold like everyone else they back. Asked if he would support her campaign for President, Koch said: We would have to believe her actions would be quite different from her rhetoric, let me put it that way. While Koch is in love with Clinton as anyone on the Right is going to get, he probably should not expect much from her. On Sunday, Clinton let the Koch brothers know what she thinks of them and their money by essentially telling Charles to go f*ck himself.Referencing the Kochs  climate denial and attempts to suppress minority voters, Clinton explained that she could not accept an endorsement from someone so evil.  Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote,  she said, linking the interview.Yes, it s no secret that the Republican field is chock-full of terribleness, but Koch is almost certainly not going to find any friends among Democrats these days. It s far, far too late for that.Watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvqf3mSz8yQFeatured image via Getty Images (John Moore)/screengrab",0
"WATCH HOW YOUNG HILLARY SUPPORTERS REACT WHEN THEY SEE ACTUAL PHOTOS OF HER ‘Everyday American’ Homes [VIDEO] So much for that whole  dead broke  nonsense Hillary Clinton has vowed to be a champion for  everyday Americans. The former Secretary of State who once described herself and husband Bill Clinton as  dead broke kicked off her campaign on June 13 and in her 45-minute speech on New York City s Roosevelt Island, Clinton delivered a message similar to her initial presidential announcement. Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times,  Clinton said in the video announcement on April 12.  But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. So what do Millennials think of a candidate who criticizes the  1 percent,  but simultaneously owns multi-million dollar properties in Washington, D.C. and New York and spends her summers in the Hamptons?

" Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",1
" It’s About Time! Twitter Just Kicked Off A Bunch Of Alt-Right Accounts For Hate Speech Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended. He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.  On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit. USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism,  Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter. I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service. They have done nothing,  Beirich said on Monday. It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been  verified.  This means Twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor",0
"HILLARY FINALLY Makes Statement On Sexual Predator and Mega-Democrat Donor Harvey Weinstein…Gets DESTROYED By Bill Clinton Rape Accuser After several days of silence, Hillary Clinton finally made a statement on the disgraced billionaire Hollywood movie producer and mega-Democrat donor, Harvey Weinstein. Well, actually Hillary really didn t come out and make a statement, true to form, Hillary hid behind her former State Department communications director, Nick Merrill, as he posted a response on behalf of Hillary about the monster predator, and one of her top donors to her presidential campaign, the virulently anti-Trump, Harvey Weinstein.Perhaps the delay in the statement was due to the pressure from Americans for Democrats to return or donate campaign contributions from the disgraced scumbag Hollywood kingpin.From Deadline: Something in the neighborhood of $1.8 million was raised at Harvey Weinstein s star-packed fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in New York City Monday night, sources tell Deadline. The event for 50 or so Clinton supporters at Weinstein s Manhattan home drew some major Hollywood names, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Candice Bergen, Bethenny Frankel and designers Vera Wang and Tory Burch.Don t hold your breath waiting for Hillary to return the $1.8 million that Weinstein and his co-hosts Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick and Leonardo DiCaprio raised for Crooked Hillary s presidential campaign.Here is the statement that Merrill released on behalf of the hiding Hillary:Statement from Secretary Clinton on Harvey Weinstein: pic.twitter.com/L1l2wl9l0I  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 10, 2017Funny, Hillary was not only silent about the rape Juanita Broaddrick claims her husband Bill committed, according to Broaddrick, Hillary went out of her way to silence her.I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73 .it never goes away.  Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016Broaddrick tweeted about Hillary s silence on the sexual assault charges against Weinstein.

" WATCH: Racist Republican Congressman Steve King Displays A Confederate Flag On His Office Desk It doesn t get any clearer than this that Iowa Rep. Steve King is a racist.During a story about King introducing Sarah s law, a program that allows parents to check if someone around their child has ever been convicted of sexual offenses against children, cameras busted the Republican openly displaying a Confederate flag on his office desk.Here s the video via YouTube. The flag can be seen at the 26 second mark.This pretty much confirms that King is a racist who fantasizes about secession. After all, he is a vicious critic of Black Lives Matter and has always hated President Obama, whom he directly blamed for the Dallas shootings in a post on Twitter.#DallasPoliceShooting has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama Officer Crowley. There were others.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) July 8, 2016Furthermore, King tried to block the addition of Harriet Tubman, a former slave who escaped and became a prominent abolitionist who helped other slave gain their freedom via the Underground Railroad, to the $20 bill in defense of slave-holder Andrew Jackson, who is going to be moved to the back.King claimed that putting Tubman on the $20 bill is racist while he tried to portray his effort as  unifying This is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories, and he s divided us on the lines of groups,  King said.  This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine s unifying. It says just don t change anything. King is also a fan of secession. When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union last month, he cheered the vote on Twitter. Congratulations to UK, especially @Nigel_Farage & UKIP, for your noble & farsighted national decision to #BreExit. WesternCiv can be saved.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) June 24, 2016Texas conservatives also cheered the decision and have used it to push their own secession movement.Democratic candidate Kim Weaver, who is challenging King for his seat, told the De Moines Register, Like a lot of Iowans, I m disgusted by his gross insensitivity to the millions of Americans for whom that flag is a symbol of racism and division, and I join them in calling on Mr. King to remove it immediately. Even Iowa s GOP governor opposes King s display of the Confederate flag because Iowa was a Union state during the Civil War.Indeed, 76,242 Iowa men fought against the Confederacy. Iowans fought bravely with distinction at the Battle of Wilson Creek in Missouri and many are buried at Vicksburg National Cemetery. King s support of the Confederate flag is an insult to their memory and the memory of the 13,000 Iowans who died trying to defeat the Confederacy. It s also disgraceful to the Iowans who were killed by Confederate bushwhackers who repeatedly raided the southern part of the state during the war.Iowa heavily backed Abraham Lincoln and the Union, so Steve King s display of an enemy flag is totally offensive, especially since he is supposed to be a United States congressman.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
" Internet SHREDS Trump For Dog Whistling Neo-Nazis With Anti-Hillary Star Of David Post (TWEETS) The only people who think all Jewish people are rich and shrewd with money are anti-Semitic racists, so therefore it should come as no surprise that this is yet another group of bigots that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump would try to appeal to in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. No, Hillary Clinton is not Jewish, but that didn t stop The Donald. You see, he is jealous because when it comes to fundraising, Hillary Clinton is winning. While she has raised roughly $68.5 million in funds during June, while Trump s campaign is broke.Instead of raising money or staying quiet on the issue, Trump, in his own unique brand of childish, racist buffoonery, Trump tweeted out a  Crooked Hillary  image that included a Star of David and a pile of money. Here is a screen capture:Now, what Trump was doing with this tweet was not lost on the great people of Twitter. This is clearly anti-Semitic, and it doesn t help that Trump has repeatedly courted white supremacists and other racists   hell, neo-nazis have pledged to support him and his fans at the GOP convention itself.

" Unhinged Sean Spicer Lashes Out At ‘Silly’ Reporters During INSANE Press Briefing (VIDEO) White House press secretary Sean Spicer held a press briefing today and inadvertently just handed Saturday Night Live new material. Spicer repeatedly interrupted and talked over reporters while trying to defend alleged president Donald Trump. He also had to address top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway s blunder this morning on Fox & Friends in which she literally hawked Ivanka s clothing line.A reporter asked about Trump s attacks on a federal judge this week. Part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind   he s not going to hold back when he feels passionate,  Spicer said.Other reporters asked about that, too, then the exchange became more tense. Thank you, you ve now asked the question about eight times,  Spicer said. Something she said to CNN earlier this week is that the President doesn t comment on everything,  a reporter said.  I want to contrast the President s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on Quebec s mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President, when he chooses to I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences,  Spicer interrupted.  I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say I was here!  the reporter said. I know, so why are you asking why he didn t do it when I literally stood here and did it?  Spicer asked. I m talking about the President s statement  the reporter said. I don t understand what you re asking,  Spicer replied. Kellyanne s comments were about how the President doesn t have time to tweet about everything,  the reporter said.  He s tweeting about this. He s not tweeting about something else. I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President  Spicer said. We re talking about the President s time,  the reporter said. What are you you re equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don t, I mean that s the silliest thing I ve ever heard. OK. This is silly,  Spicer said while speaking over the reporter.  Next. OK. Thank you. You ve asked your question. Thank you. Conway s bigly mistake this morning was brought up. Questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump,  a reporter said.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line here? Kellyanne has been counseled and that s all we re going to go with,  Spicer replied.  She s been counseled on that subject, and that s it.

"ULTIMATE DISRESPECT: VA Sent Mail Related To Disability Claims From Vets To Shredder Our current government can t be bothered with resolving these heinous acts against our veterans who rely on our government for their health care. They ve got more pressing issues in our military that need to be addressed, like pushing a gay agenda in our military:The VA s Office of Inspector General said it launched an  unannounced inspection  of the Los Angeles office after hearing allegations that the VA staff there was shredding mail related to veterans  disability compensation claims. Though the OIG said it can t measure how often this might have happened, it did say it found some examples of mail lined up for the shredder that instead should have been opened and read. Although we cannot quantify or identify claims-related documents that the VARO may have shredded prior to our review, we found nine claims-related documents that VARO staff incorrectly placed in personal shred bins for non-claims related documents,  the OIG reported.  Eight of the nine documents had the potential to affect veterans  benefits and one had no effect on the veteran s benefits. The OIG said the placement of these letters in  shred bins  means that they were able to bypass the first level of control, which requires letters to be reviewed before they are shredded. Of the nine claims-related documents, five did not have required initials of both the employee and supervisor and the remaining four had only the employee s initials,  the report said.  If   staff and their supervisors followed VBA policy, these nine claims-related documents would not have been placed in personal shred bins that are designated for non-claims related documents. The report said if the OIG had not stepped in,  it is likely that.   staff would have inappropriately destroyed the nine claims-related documents we found. It added that a records management officer was supposed to be on staff in Los Angeles to prevent this from happening, but said there was no one in that position from August 2014 until February 2015. The original records officer was promoted, and the office s assistant director  determined that it was not necessary to fill the   position. Officials who tried to take over that role  lacked training regarding maintaining, reviewing, protecting and appropriately destroying veterans  and other governmental paper records,  the report said.The OIG said the Los Angeles office couldn t provide any documentation at all on what documents it had shredded over the past two years.The watchdog recommended that the Los Angeles office should  implement a plan and assess the effectiveness of training  when it comes to handling, processing and destroying these records. The arbitrary destruction of mail by officials at the Los Angeles VA is a stark reminder of the need for true reform of the Veterans Administration,  said Concerned Veterans for America CEO Pete Hegseth.  Rather than make sure each veteran s voice was heard, and each claim was handled professionally, VA officials instead effectively silenced those who fought for our freedom and security, casually sending their letters to the shredder.

"LOL! OBAMA WARNS VOTERS Donald Trump Is Unvetted, Unserious…”This is not a reality show” Says the guy who was a Jr. Senator and Community Organizer prior to becoming President of the United States.   And who can forget our  selfie  President?And then there s the famous Nelson Mandela funeral selfie:President Obama skewered Donald Trump on Friday, warning that the Republicans  presumptive nominee isn t serious enough for the presidency, his plans aren t plausible, and his ideas haven t been vetted sufficiently.Let s not forget that when Obama was living in his own little narcissistic world and making a contribution to absolutely no-one Trump was busy creating jobs.Obama continued: He has a long record that needs to be examined. And I think it s important for us ot take seriously the statements he s made in the past,  Obama said.  We are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. These were Obama s first extended comments about Trump since the New York mogul cemented his role as the presumptive GOP nominee on Tuesday night. He spoke in the White House briefing room, using remarks on the economy and a crackdown on tax evasion as an opportunity to air his views. It was clear he expected questions about Trump, and intended to use the appearance to discuss the new phase of the election. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States and what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny,  he said.Via: Dallas Morning NewsSpeaking of  scrutiny :Here is a Breitbart News top ten list of things that Obama has refused to release (a complete list would fill volumes):10. State senate papers. In the 2008 primary, Obama criticized Hillary Clinton for not releasing papers from her eight years as First Lady but failed to produce any papers from his eight years in Springfield.  They could have been thrown out,  he said.9. Academic transcripts. His supposed academic brilliance was a major selling point, but Obama (by his own admission) was a mediocre student. His GPA at Occidental was a B-plus at best, and his entering class at Columbia was weak. Can he prove his merit?8. Book proposal. Obama s literary agent claimed he was  born in Kenya for sixteen years. His original book proposal exists biographer David Maraniss refers to it and seems to have embellished other key details of his life. Yet it has never been released.7. Medical records. In 2000, and again (briefly) in 2008, GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain released thousands of pages of his medical records. Obama, who had abused drugs and continued smoking, merely provided a one-page doctor s note.6. Small-dollar donors. In 2008, the McCain campaign released the names of donors who had contributed less than $200, though it was not required to do so. But the Obama campaign refused, amidst accusations it had accepted illegal foreign contributions.5. The Khalidi tape. In 2003, Obama attended a party for his good friend, the radical Palestinian academic Rashid Khalidi. The event featured incendiary anti-Israel rhetoric. The LA Times broke the story, but has refused to release the tape and so has Obama.4. The real White House guest list. Touting its transparency, the Obama White House released its guest logs but kept many visits secret, and moved meetings with lobbyists off-site. It also refused to confirm the identities of visitors like Bertha Lewis of ACORN.3. Countless FOIA requests. The Obama administration has been described as  the worst  ever in complying with Freedom of Information Act requests for documents. It has also punished whistleblowers like David Walpin, who exposed cronyism in Americorps.2. Health reform negotiations. Candidate Obama promised that health care reform negotiations would be televised on C-SPAN. Instead, there were back-room deals worth millions with lobbyists and legislators the details of which are only beginning to emerge.1. Fast and Furious documents. After months of stonewalling Congress, Attorney General Eric Holder asked President Obama to use executive privilege to conceal thousands of documents related to the deadly scandal and Obama did just that.In addition to the above, Obama and his campaign have lied about many facts about his past his membership in the New Party; his extensive connections with ACORN; and his continued relationship with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright, among other examples. Obama s own memoir is filled with fabrications. And now he is lying about his opponent s honorable record in business. He and the media have no shame.And oh yeah one more thing that we almost forgot:",1
"BREAKING NEWS: “At The Direction Of The President” 22-Yr Old American Is Released From N. Korean Prison [VIDEO] 22-yr old American Otto Warmbier was arrested and imprisoned during Barack Obama s last term in office. He was released  at the direction  of President Trump. Although former President Barack Obama was unable to secure her release, after being in office for less than 4 months, President Trump was also able to secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who spent three years in an Egyptian jail over what human rights groups say were bogus charges.Otto Warmbier, the college student arrested, tried and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year for trying to swipe a souvenir from his hotel during a guided tour of the communist nation, has been released, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Tuesday.The 22-year-old Warmbier has served just over a year of his 15-year sentence   allegedly for taking down a sign of the late dictator Kim Jong Il while Warmbier was in the country with a tour group. As of Tuesday morning, Warmbier was on his way home to Cincinnati, although other details surrounding the dramatic events were not released. At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea,  Tillerson said.  Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family. The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained. Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier. Warmbier s parents, who have appeared on Fox News Channel in the past to plead for their son s release, expressed gratitude. FOX News",0
"WALMART Is Selling “Made In Mexico” Apparel Featuring Domestic Terror Group [VIDEO] The domestic terror group, Antifa, has been around for a while, but since Donald Trump s inauguration in January, they ve become more visible and increasingly more violent. Well, good news for Americans who support violent, masked, molotov cocktail throwing, ax and hammer-wielding punks, who run through major cities in packs, busting out windows, setting fire to vehicles, and pretty much destroying anything or anyone in their path, as a way to show their  resistance  to a Donald Trump presidency, Walmart now offers a line of  Antifa  apparel for you. If you re struggling to find the perfect gift for your violent, snot-nosed, anti-Trump student, or unemployed basement dweller in your family this holiday season, you can find it online at Walmart. Walmart is selling  Antifa  clothing that  will [allow you to] express yourself inside the opposition to the ideology, organizations, governments, and people from the far right (fascism). The mega-retailer is offering at least 13 different sweatshirts  made in Mexico of 100% COTTON for all-day comfort  promoting the group whose activities were  formally classified  by the Obama Administration  as domestic terrorist violence  as early as April 2016, according to Politico, despite the group s efforts to downplay this determination. Antifa,  or Anti-Fascist Action, is an informal grouping of communist, anarchist, and other far-left street gangs. Drawing inspiration from the German Communist Party s street fighters of the 1930s, the modern movement grew out of the European far-left punk scene in the 1980s. These unapologetically violent bands of leftists were largely unknown in the United States until recent years, when America s post-Occupy Wall Street far-left began adopting the name.This (anti-Trump) video provides a window into the violent Antifa group and how they destroy other people s property while running from cops and calling for them to be killed. Listen to Antifa chanting:  AK47 put the cops in  piggy heaven  on the streets of Washington DC during Donald Trump s inauguration at about the 1:20-minute mark. Watch what happens to the young Trump supporter who tries to speak reasonably with the Antifa terrorists about how using violence is not the answer, as he puts out a fire started by the terror group at the 9:20-minute mark:Antifa is well known for dozens of violent crimes against people they consider  fascists  on both sides of the Atlantic. Just remember to keep creating a better world,  the clothing advertisements encourage.This glorification of Antifa was mirrored Friday by the New York Times, which published a fashion style guide for the group:  practical advice on how to dress for a riot.  In their guide, the Times explains why a uniform look is needed, from Breitbart News s Charlie Nash: These defensive methods work only if there are enough black-clad others nearby. A single person in all black and multiple face masks is an eye grabber. Finally, the Times claimed that dressing in black militant gear and concealing your face forms an  emotional connection  with other rioters. Tactical considerations aside, it s this emotional connection with other members of the bloc that many practitioners highlight the most in interviews,  they proclaimed.  It s why soldiers and police have uniforms. Walmart has come under previous criticism for selling  Black Lives Matter  shirts and other items. Following a request from the national Fraternal Order of Police, the retail giant eventually removed one of the items last December, shirts that said  Bulletproof,  but refused to remove the rest.As with the  Black Lives Matter  paraphernalia, the Antifa products are being sold by a third party manufacturer, in this case, Tee Bangers, on Walmart s website.

"SWEDEN IS SCREWED: “Women Who Don’t Wear Headscarf Are Asking To Be Raped” How very diverse! These refugees sure know how to assimilate in their new host countries don t they?Stickers calling for democracy to be replaced with Islam and for women who do not wear a veil to be raped have appeared in public places in Sweden. They have been reported to the police. Pictures of the stickers, which have been stuck to objects on streets in Nybro, Sm land, have been circulating on social media.Jihad Watch   Surprised? Don t be. The Qur an teaches that Infidel women can be lawfully taken for sexual use (cf. its allowance for a man to take  captives of the right hand,  4:3, 4:24, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30). The Qur an says:  O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.  (33:59) The implication there is that if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused, and that such abuse would be justified.How these Muslim migrants have enriched Sweden!One of the stickers reads, in English:  Women who don t wear a headscarf are asking to be raped.  Another reads:  No democracy. We just want Islam,  Fria Tider has reported.The stickers have been reported to the police who are currently investigating who placed them there, but admitted that at the moment they do not know who is behind them.The appearance of the stickers comes just weeks after a number of stickers appeared in nearby Emmaboda bearing the message  Multiculturalism is bad for your children and your grandchildren.  However, those stickers were emblazoned with  Nordfront , the Swedish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement, a national socialist movement. They were also stylised, made to look like the health warnings carried on cigarette packets.But unlike the Nordfront stickers, the Islamist stickers feature plain white text on a plain dark grey background with no logo or marking to indicate who placed them. Consequently, while some people have argued that they were placed by newly arrived asylum seekers with an agenda to promote Islam in Sweden, others have argued that they could be the work of Swedes seeking to  incite hatred  against the immigrants.In that respect, the controversy closely resembles a recent case in which leaflets were posted through letterboxes in Manchester, England, calling on British people not to walk their dogs in public in order for the area to be kept  pure  for Muslims. As citizens of a multicultural nation, those who live in the UK must learn to understand and respect the legacy and lifestyle of the Muslims who live alongside them,  the leaflets read.They were distributed by a group called Public Purity, who stated on their website their intention to have all dogs removed from the public sphere in Britain to keep Muslims pure.  If dogs are not permitted to be present in public, Muslims could live their lives with a burden lifted from their shoulders and without having to fear being tainted with no fault of their own,  the group argued.Via: Breitbart ",1

"“DIRTY JOBS” HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist  Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.",1
" Donald Trump Likes How North Korean Dictator Kills People To Solidify Power (VIDEO) Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents. You ve got to give him credit,  Trump gushed. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that. A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power. Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign. After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies. He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt. He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt. If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr",1
"NYC BOMBER’S DAD Reveals Son’s Terrorist Attack Could Have Been Stopped If They’d Listened To Him…The FBI Clearly Missed That Narrative  Two years before the bombings that Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of carrying out in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that his son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two law enforcement officials.The father, Mohammad Rahami, in a brief interview on Tuesday, said that at the time he told agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his concern, his son had just had a fight with another of his sons and stabbed the man, leading to a criminal investigation. Two years ago I go to the F.B.I. because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?  he said.  But they check almost two months, they say,  He s O.K., he s clean, he s not a terrorist.  I say O.K. He added:  Now they say he is a terrorist. I say O.K. It is not clear if officers ever interviewed Ahmad Rahami, but as investigators turn their focus to what might have motivated, inspired or led him to plant bombs in Chelsea in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, new clues are emerging indicating that he may have been increasingly receptive to extremist ideology.When Mr. Rahami was captured during a shootout with the police on Monday, the authorities found a notebook, pierced with a bullet hole and covered in blood, expressing opinions sympathetic to jihadist causes, according to a law enforcement official who agreed to speak about the investigation only on the condition of anonymity.Read more: NYT",0

"JUST IN: OBAMA APPOINTED JUDGE Presiding Over Michael Flynn’s Case SUDDENLY Recuses Himself…CLINTON Appointed Judge Will Sentence Flynn Now, a Clinton appointed judge who took Flynn s guilty plea has suddenly recused himself and Flynn will now face an Obama appointed judge for his sentencing. Hmmm Politico   President Donald Trump s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, will face a different judge to be sentenced than the one who took Flynn s guilty plea to a felony false statement charge last week, court records show.Judge Emmet Sullivan was randomly assigned to take over the case after Judge Rudolph Contreras recused himself.A court spokeswoman confirmed to POLITICO that the reassignment of the case was due to Contreras  recusal, but did not immediately respond to a query about the reason.Sullivan is an appointee of President Bill Clinton, while Contreras was appointed by President Barack Obama.Flynn pleaded guilty last Friday to a false statement charge brought by prosecutors from the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

" California Trump Rally Leads To Violence Between Thousands Of Protestors And Supporters (VIDEO) One of the most tragic aspects of Donald Trump s candidacy (and there have been lots of  tragic aspects) is that he s managed to do something no one thought to be possible for a candidate running for president in 21st Century America: He s managed to not only normalize racism, but violence as well. There have been so many instances of violence that they ve become normalized. In other words, we ve come to expect violence, and even more alarmingly, we ve also come to accept the violence. However, it s important to fight this normalization and continue to report on the absurdity that is Donald Trump.That absurdity was on display outside a Trump rally in California on Thursday as supporters clashed with protestors. Many of the anti-Trump protestors held Mexican and American flags and were outraged at Trump s rhetoric. About 20 protesters out of hundreds were arrested outside of the rally, a Trump supporter was beaten, and property was damaged including a police vehicle.Watch video here:Since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination, Trump has made a series of inflammatory remarks about Mexicans, calling some of the immigrants rapists and murderers. He continuously talks about building a wall to prevent Mexican immigrants from coming into the country. His rhetoric has created a divisive atmosphere that has bred racism and violence.The bottom line is that Trump has created an environment that is tearing the country apart rather than working for unity. If his candidacy is any indication of what his presidency will be like, we are all in deep trouble as a society. He is normalizing the toxicity of violence and racism and should he be elected, America will become a very dangerous place for a lot of people.Featured image via video screenshot.   ",1

" WATCH: Trump Brags About Himself And Trump Tower During Remarks At United Nations Headquarters It took all of a few seconds for Donald Trump to start bragging about himself during his remarks at the United Nations.Trump World Tower is a residential skyscraper catering primarily to the wealthy.It also happens to be across the street from the United Nations Headquarters where the General Assembly is meeting this week and where Trump spoke on Monday morning.Predictably, Trump began his remarks by bragging about the building and himself. Thank you very much. Thank you. I actually saw great potential right across the street to be honest with you,  Trump began.  And it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project. So, I want to thank you, Ambassador Haley for your introduction and your steadfast advocacy for American interests on the world stage. Here s the video via Twitter.Pres. Trump on luxury residential property by UN: United Nations being there was reason  that turned out to be such a successful project.  pic.twitter.com/kid9STah3W  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 18, 2017So, Trump can t even stop being a narcissist for one day to address the distinguished diplomats and representatives of the United Nations.It should be noted that New Yorkers strongly opposed the construction of Trump World Tower in the late 1990s, including legendary journalist Walter Cronkite.Basically, Trump robbed the neighborhood of their view of the East River and Long Island by placing a big ugly tower in front of it so that only wealthy people staying in his building could enjoy it. Residents were also concerned that the big ugly building would dwarf the more aesthetically pleasing United Nations Headquarters, which it did.Trump is nothing more than a cheap salesman who is more interested in touting his real estate ventures than he is in promoting international peace and cooperation. That s incredibly sad.Once again, Trump embarrassed himself and America on the world stage. And those were just his opening remarks. Just imagine how much more he will embarrass our country before he is done speaking. The United States is going to be an even bigger joke on the international stage than we have ever been.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

"DOJ LEADER PUTS BLAME FOR RIOTS ON…SLAVERY? It s no accident that President Obama named Vanita Gupta acting head of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. Gupta is beloved by the radical left for her militant hostility toward law enforcement officers. Here s a fantastic overview from J. Christian Adams who has intimate knowledge of what s going on at the DOJ. He worked  there and knows just how the DOJ has been turned into a politicized radical leftist entity of the Obama administration. Here s an example of that:Vanita Gupta, head of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, has told a lawyers group in Colorado that slavery and Jim Crow helped fuel the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.The last few days have seen a number of fanciful stories with the Obama administration seemingly questioning the authority of local police. I ve long maintained that the administration is nakedly seeking to federalize policing standards   but get rid of local police? No way, that sounds like something broadcast from a shortwave station in Austin, Texas. But then up steps Vanita Gupta to lend some credibility to the idea that some want to disband local police and replace police powers with the federal government. Speaking to a group of left-wing lawyers in Colorado, Gupta had this to say:The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have police or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve.There is no question that we need police in our communities.The conversation? What conversation is Gupta hearing that needs to be corrected? Who brought up the idea we might not need police? Nobody sane, for sure.If you read the entirety of Gupta s speech, you ll get a sense of what is going on in the mind of the anti-police left. Officials in this administration still think it is rational and acceptable to bring up the name Michael Brown in the context of anything other than a likely felon against whom deadly force was justifiably used. Behold Gupta:Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their deaths and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with police officers, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering.In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in officer-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration   the lack of trust in the police   is real, and it is profound.Gupta asks the question that many Americans have already asked and answered:It s worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it?To most law-abiding Americans, the idea of fleeing from the police, or worse, charging at a policeman you have already punched, is simply beyond the realm of possibility.So how did we get here? Was it a breakdown of values? Perhaps a pervasive tolerance for lawlessness? Of course not. Says Gupta:Let s start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can t be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It s in part the product of historical awareness about the role that police have played in enforcing and perpetuating (wait for it! here it comes!) slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.Read more: pjmediaRead more: pjmedia",1
BLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL: Computer Keyboard For Loony Radical Leftists  ,0
" WATCH: Pat Robertson Gets INCREDIBLY Offensive In Full-Throated Defense Of Trump How much more depraved does a so-called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real Christian?Because one would think that conservative  Christians  of all people would be absolutely opposed to Donald Trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on Friday.But evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting Trump as long as it means Hillary Clinton does not become president.Family Research Council head Tony Perkins made that clear on Saturday when he STILL voiced support for Trump despite his  grab them by the p*ssy  remark. My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the Constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years,  Perkins said.Ralph Reed of Faith and Freedom Coalition basically said the same thing. Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal. Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns. In other words, Trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative  Christian  leaders.And that includes 700 Club preacher Pat Robertson, who called Trump s behavior  macho  while continuing to endorse him for president. A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho,  Robertson said on Monday.  And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off,  Okay, he s dead, now you ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign. Robertson proceeded to declare Trump the winner of Sunday night s debate and called him  a Phoenix  rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign.Here s the video via YouTube.These hypocrites have been whining for years about how America needs a president who shares their so-called biblical values, but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the White House who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation, even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office. These people are NOT Christians. They merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

"OBAMA’S ARROGANCE: WATCH As He Admonishes Reporter For Asking If He Was “Content” With 4 Americans Held In Iran Jail [VIDEO] Being called out for his utter incompetence as a leader by the press is not something Obama is used to CBS News s Major Garrett asked President Obama at a press conference Wednesday if he was  content  with four Americans held in Iranian jails while his administration celebrated the nuclear deal.  Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content with all the fanfare around this deal to leave the conscious of this nation, the strength of this nation unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?  Garrett asked. That s nonsense and you should know better,  Obama bit back.  Nobody s  content  and our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out. Garrett later brushed off the scolding on CBS s news streaming network, saying,  Clearly, it struck a nerve. That was my intention Was it provocative? Yes. Was it intended to be as such? Absolutely.

Choices choices MANCHESTER, N.H.   Hillary Clinton spoke of being  knocked down  and having problems with young voters in a bitter concession speech after losing to Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. I don t know what we d have done tonight if we d actually won. This is pretty exciting,  Clinton said to her crowd of supporters shortly after 9 PM Eastern Time, flanked onstage by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, who did not speak.  I just want to say, I still love New Hampshire and I always will. People are angry. But there s also hungry. They re hungry for solutions. What are we going to do?,  Clinton said. I know I have some work to do, especially with young people,  Clinton said.  Even if they are not supporting me right now, I am supporting them It s not whether you get knocked down that matters, it s whether you get back up. Clinton devolved into an angry, ranting style by speech s end, calling for  human rights  for gays, women, workers, and others. She also pivoted to focus on South Carolina, which will be decided by the black vote, talking about how African-American parents should not have to worry about their kids being  harassed  or  shot,  and immigrant families should not have to  lie awake at night waiting for a knock on the door  signaling deportation.She also spoke of the contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan and of a hypothetical  grandmother  forced to choose between rent or food because some drug company raised medicine prices by 4,000 percent   an apparent reference to scandal-ridden former drug CEO Martin Shkreli.Clinton lost resoundingly to Sanders in the Granite State. By the time she finished her speech, Sanders was beating her 58.5 percent to 39.7 percent with 37 percent of the precincts reporting. CNN called the race for Sanders at approximately 8 PM.Sanders  win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.Forty-one percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats, according to CNN exit polling.

"WATCH: GERALDO EMBARRASSES San Juan Mayor Who Said Trump’s “Killing” Puerto Ricans: “I Don’t See People Dying” Let s hope this angry leftist mayor doesn t prevent individual donors from contributing to help the people of San Juan who may not agree with her hateful attacks on our President, who is bending over backward to get the help to the victims of the hurricane.Is anyone else sick and tired of hearing this mayor whine about everything America is NOT doing for her? San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities. The woman even went so far as to say that U.S. armed forces need to  come in and distribute the aid. Via: MRCTV",1
" Newt Gingrich Just SLAMMED Romney, Dubya And His Daddy For Being Hypocrites And Babies (VIDEO) The actors and actresses of Fox News have received their marching orders and the run to November will officially be the propaganda machine for Donald Trump. That s how it seems, at least, as hosts align themselves with people like Newt Gingrich, and other hard-core party liners who will vote for whomever has an (R) next to their name. Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want, he turned his attention to the two former presidents, George W. and George H.W. Bush. Both of those historical failures have decided that they refuse to support Donald Trump, and nor will they attend the convention to initiate the Fourth Reich. Little brother Jeb has also chimed in that he ll be on the sidelines as well, as though he had a choice. Jeb was Trump s first real target. When it worked and Jeb dropped out, pundits everywhere were shocked. Then one by one they fell. All of the party elite; all of the establishment favorites.The money from the Koch brothers never appeared, because as evil as they are, they aren t stupid. Donald Trump ran the most effective underdog campaign in history by loaning himself money and going out and getting free press. Trump used the Republican Party and the agenda of fear and hate they ve fostered for far too long against them like a champ. The uneducated bigots crawled out of the woodwork to demand the country be great again and (insert required amount of rhetoric and lies).As the stupidity gained steam and made its way towards a downhill run to Cleveland, the party began to fracture. The pledge they made Trump sign now makes them look like massive hypocrites.

He described the loss of the information as a  historic act of devastating incompetence. More on this report from RT  RTWikiLeaks will give tech companies which suffered  billions of dollars of damage  when hacked by the CIA  exclusive access  to its technical expertise, founder Julian Assange revealed at a press conference.Speaking in a livestream Thursday, Assange said the leaked information originated from an isolated computer, separated from others in the network, at CIA headquarters in Virginia, describing the loss of the information as an historic act of devastating incompetence.  READ MORE: WikiLeaks says just 1% of #Vault7 covert documents released so farRaising questions over whether the loss of the information was known to former US President Barack Obama or current president Donald Trump before being revealed by WikiLeaks, Assange also questioned if the loss had been shared with companies such as Apple and Google, which were made vulnerable by it. Potentially billions of dollars of damage  has been done by the CIA to tech companies, Assange said, adding trust has been damaged by the revelations, in both the US government and US exports. He later added that some of the fixes to devices exposed as vulnerable by the leak would be quickly fixed but others, including smart TVs, would be more difficult and take longer to fix.

"ULTIMATE DISRESPECT: VA Sent Mail Related To Disability Claims From Vets To Shredder Our current government can t be bothered with resolving these heinous acts against our veterans who rely on our government for their health care. They ve got more pressing issues in our military that need to be addressed, like pushing a gay agenda in our military:The VA s Office of Inspector General said it launched an  unannounced inspection  of the Los Angeles office after hearing allegations that the VA staff there was shredding mail related to veterans  disability compensation claims. Though the OIG said it can t measure how often this might have happened, it did say it found some examples of mail lined up for the shredder that instead should have been opened and read. Although we cannot quantify or identify claims-related documents that the VARO may have shredded prior to our review, we found nine claims-related documents that VARO staff incorrectly placed in personal shred bins for non-claims related documents,  the OIG reported.  Eight of the nine documents had the potential to affect veterans  benefits and one had no effect on the veteran s benefits. The OIG said the placement of these letters in  shred bins  means that they were able to bypass the first level of control, which requires letters to be reviewed before they are shredded. Of the nine claims-related documents, five did not have required initials of both the employee and supervisor and the remaining four had only the employee s initials,  the report said.  If   staff and their supervisors followed VBA policy, these nine claims-related documents would not have been placed in personal shred bins that are designated for non-claims related documents. The report said if the OIG had not stepped in,  it is likely that.   staff would have inappropriately destroyed the nine claims-related documents we found. It added that a records management officer was supposed to be on staff in Los Angeles to prevent this from happening, but said there was no one in that position from August 2014 until February 2015. The original records officer was promoted, and the office s assistant director  determined that it was not necessary to fill the   position. Officials who tried to take over that role  lacked training regarding maintaining, reviewing, protecting and appropriately destroying veterans  and other governmental paper records,  the report said.The OIG said the Los Angeles office couldn t provide any documentation at all on what documents it had shredded over the past two years.The watchdog recommended that the Los Angeles office should  implement a plan and assess the effectiveness of training  when it comes to handling, processing and destroying these records. The arbitrary destruction of mail by officials at the Los Angeles VA is a stark reminder of the need for true reform of the Veterans Administration,  said Concerned Veterans for America CEO Pete Hegseth.  Rather than make sure each veteran s voice was heard, and each claim was handled professionally, VA officials instead effectively silenced those who fought for our freedom and security, casually sending their letters to the shredder.

" Republican Panics On Live TV, Can’t Say Trump Is Capable Of Handling North Korea (VIDEO) Donald Trump s credibility and  power  has become such a joke that not even members of his own party have any faith in him to deal with the current issues that America is facing.On Sunday, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) unintentionally showed everyone just how little the GOP believes in Trump when he couldn t force himself to say that Trump could handle the current nuclear crisis the United States is facing with North Korea. In an interview with CNN s Dana Bash, Flake was put on the spot about how capable Trump is (and isn t). Bash asked Flake: Senator, there are a lot of people waking up this morning in this country very concerned about what they re hearing from North Korea. Do you share Clapper s concern, not just about North Korea, but with the president s ability to respond? Flake couldn t give a straight answer. He said: Well, I   I do have good confidence in our national security team and those who are advising the president. And the president does not have experience in this   in this kind of situation, but few presidents do when they come into office. And I m confident that the people around the president are giving him good advice, and I believe that he will follow it. I sure hope he does. Obviously, you like a leader that s measured and sober and consistent. Our allies want to hear that. I think our adversaries need to hear that. But we have got a good team around the president. Bash was quick to put Flake on the spot and point out that he hadn t actually said that Trump could handle this matter. Bash pressed,  Senator, you talked there about the president s team, but not about the president himself. Are you concerned about the president himself, as James Clapper is? Flake continued to stumble through this interview: Well, like I said, no president comes in prepared with regard to foreign policy experience. That s why you have a good team around them. I have had my concerns, I think everyone has, at some of the statements that have been made by the president with regard to NATO and other areas in foreign policy. Like I said, I think we   we want somebody who is   who is measured and sober and consistent and conservative in this regard. But he has a good team around him, and I have confidence in them. This is absolutely humiliating for Trump. Not only was his Defense Secretary, James Mattis, sent out earlier today to deliver a public statement on North Korea in his place, but now a member of his own party practically said Trump isn t capable of handling North Korea. Flake refused to support Trump and say he was a competent president, and instead opted to talk about the experts surrounding him.You can watch Flake humiliate Trump below:Featured image via screenshot",1

He hates the business of being the president because he can t do what he wants, when he wants and how he wants. He can t be a dictator, and he can t tolerate people actually telling him he s wrong.

"Have the US, Trump Really Abandoned ‘Regime Change’ in Syria?  Member of the US-backed Free Syrian Army, Aleppo, Syria. (Photo: Mada Media. Source: Wikicommons)Miles Elliott 21st Century Wire For the past few days, news outlets have been reporting on the Trump Administration and CIA s announcement to end the controversial covert program to arm and train  moderate rebels  fighting to overthrow the Syrian government of Bashar al Assad. While many who want peace in Syria see this move as a step in the right direction, others still doubt that the underlying goal of ousting Assad has been abandoned completely. The decision may serve a number of purposes, but the long-term goals of the US and its close coalition allies do not change easily, and removing President Assad from power has been a centerpiece of their regional restructuring plan for a very long time.Does the announcement really mean that Trump is going to leave Assad alone? Is the US turning a corner in Syria and finally learning from the mistakes it made in Iraq and Libya? Is it really a concession to Russia? Is Trump finally actualizing his campaign rhetoric that seemed to reject America s foreign wars?Not likely.Of course, it s possible that Trump is at odds with other factions in the US government s military and foreign policy establishment, possibly because he recognizes the danger of arming terrorists and the political damage this might do to his own reputation as a leader who is  tough on terror.  Such a belief however, might be extremely generous to Trump, especially considering how under his authority the US military has dangerously escalated several wars, not just in Syria, but also in Yemen, and probably soon in Afghanistan.A more likely explanation is that the Trump administration and a complicit mainstream media are trying to manage public perceptions regarding six years of troublesome US involvement in Syria. In a bait-and-switch type PR deception, Washington might be attempting to generate the perception of de-escalation   even as the US increases its presence in Syria.Consider the SourceWithin hours of this story breaking, it had been covered by major outlets from across the mainstream media, and since that time there have been a variety of reactions from different commentators and media platforms.Some, such as former US diplomat Jim Jatras, are hailing the decision as a  game-changer .Others, like New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof (one of the first in the mainstream media to promote the White Helmets) called it a  major gift to Russia .Middle East  expert  Charles Lister claims it will strengthen terrorists in Syria, while numerous others are saying it will weaken the terrorists.Many of these reactions, however, as well as all of the reporting on this decision, all seem to stem from a single story in The Washington Post. That said, there are a few things that should be pointed out about this original story Washington Post and the CIAIt is well known that Amazon chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. It is also public knowledge that the CIA has a contract with Amazon to use its cloud computing services. In fact, beginning in 2014 Amazon began providing its services to the CIA under a $600 million contract that is good for up to ten years, making the CIA a long-term customer of Amazon. Seeing as the owner of The Washington Post has a long-term commercial relationship with the CIA, any reporting from that newspaper covering CIA activities could be viewed as a potential conflict of interest. This would be a very unpopular position for any mainstream media outlets to take. Normally, these outlets will unquestioningly repeat this or any story by The Post concerning the CIA, and that s the end of that.NOTE: After this article was published at 21WIRE, Trump came out swinging at Bezos and the  Amazon-Washington Post :The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017Of course this is not to say that the decision to end CIA support to terrorists in Syria has not been taken. Much of that activity will remain classified and certainly redacted if ever released. However, the fact that information was  leaked exclusively  to the Washington Post by unnamed US officials may indicate a desire to have the story spun in a particular way for particular reasons. Syrian  rebels  fire missiles toward the towns of Kafarya and Foua (Photo: Qasioun News Agency. Source: Wikicommons)Focus on RussiaA major element of the spin on the The Washington Post story can be found in the headline:  Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow  (emphasis added). From the outset, the Post is portraying the decision to stop arming groups trying to overthrow the Syrian government as a concession to Russia.This is clearly one of the themes of the article, as it also appears in quotes from an unnamed official who said,  Putin won in Syria , and from Charles Lister, who stated:  We are falling into a Russian trap.  In total, Russia, Moscow, Putin or the Kremlin are mentioned no less than 20 times in the article, a clear sign of The Post s attempt to place Trump s decision in the context of Russian interests in Syria.There are several obvious problems with this narrative, however.Firstly, it is implied that if Russia  wins  in Syria, that America somehow  loses   but is that really the case? One of the points Trump campaigned on is that US and Russian interests in Syria are actually aligned in the wider fight to defeat ISIS and radical Islamist terror.Secondly, there is zero evidence to indicate that the decision to end CIA support for terrorist groups in Syria was driven by Russia   but that hasn t stopped many in the mainstream media, like New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof, and Washington establishment figures like John McCain, for inferring a Russian conspiracy is at play. It is true that The Post s article was published within two weeks of the recent ceasefire in southwestern Syria agreed by the US, Russia and Jordan. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the decision to halt the  train and equip  program in Syria was made a month ago, after a White House meeting between Trump, national security advisor H R McMaster, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.At most, leaking the story to the press may have been an empty gesture toward Russia, but facts on the ground still indicate that the conflict in Syria is being escalated in other ways, as we shall see. Independent journalist Gareth Porter offers this analysis: By 2016, when the Syrian government, with the support of the Russians and Iranians and others, were able to push the al-Qaeda-led rebels out of Aleppo, really the major part of the conflict between the rebels and the Assad government was completed. And from then on I think the fate of this program was really sealed The decision to announce this clearly followed the agreement that was reached very recently with the Russians on a ceasefire in southern Syria  And so to announce it was a gesture in part towards the Russians, but the idea that has been reported in some news media that somehow this is a concession to the Russians is totally false. That really doesn t follow logically, in terms of the nature of the decision and the timing of it. Furthermore, to believe the decision is a  gift  to Russia is to completely discount the fact that arming terrorists is simply wrong, or at the very least dangerous. As former US diplomat Jim Jatras stated: It doesn t occur to some people that not supporting terrorists is the right thing for America, having nothing to do with Russia. Thirdly, in light of the year-long string of unsubstantiated and unproven accusations perpetuated by US mainstream media that somehow the Trump team  colluded  with Russia to affect the outcome of the US presidential election, pushing the Russian angle to this story in Syria appears to be an attempt to add fuel to that fire. However, if one unpacks the rationale underlying this suggestion, it becomes clear how illogical it really is.As it turns out, even US commanders do not subscribe to the Russian conspiracy theory angle regarding the CIA stopping arms to  rebels  in Syria. This was confirmed by U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of Special Operations Command, who told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado the following this past week: At least from what I know about that program and the decision to end it, (it was) absolutely not a sop to the Russians.  If mainstream media institutions like The Post object to alleged Russian interference in US elections, they presumably do so on the grounds that foreign interference in a sovereign country s domestic affairs is  against the rules  of the international community. If that is the case, then surely they must also object to the funding and arming of terrorist or  rebel  groups by one country to overthrow the government of another. If The Post were being consistent, and not hypocritical in their editorial line, then any disapproval at the unsubstantiated allegation that Russia interfered  nonviolently   with America s democracy, should be matched by unbridled outrage at the US funding, training and arming terrorists in Syria to violently overthrow its government.

Source: Wikicommons)At the root of all three of these problems with this article and its paper s stance toward Russia is the belief in American exceptionalism   which is particularly strong in the US  defense  establishment and which is what gives the US license to break the very same rules that it enforces on other countries.The idea of American exceptionalism was explicitly countered by Vladimir Putin in his editorial for the New York Times (published after the 2013 chemical weapons incident in Ghouta when the US was on the brink of going to war in Syria) in which he stated: It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal. Goodbye CIA, Hello PentagonAmerican exceptionalism taken to its logical conclusion has also resulted in the doctrine of  full spectrum dominance . In the current era of full-spectrum or hybrid warfare, there are many tools in the US government s belt. So even as this particular CIA program ends, there are myriad ways in which the US might continue its involvement in the destablization and possible dismembering of the Syrian nation-state.The most obvious is that the Pentagon and US military are expanding their presence in Syria. The Post states that the US military s anti-ISIS air campaign will continue, as will the Pentagon s  train-and-equip  program for the primarily Kurdish militias operating around Raqqa.However, The Post completely fails to mention the presence of American and allied troops on the ground in Syria. Last month 21WIRE warned of the danger of escalation from the presence of US and British troops stationed near al-Tanf in the southeast of Syria. Since then the buildup has continued, and within the past few weeks 21WIRE reported on the series of eight US military bases established inside Syrian borders, complete with heavy weapons such as the HIMARS rocket system.Gareth Porter summarized it this way: The United States has created this alleged stake in the conflict in Syria over the last few years, over the ISIS presence in Raqqa and surrounding areas. Once the US began its bombing program both in Iraq and in Syria against ISIS, that created a whole set of new dynamics which inevitably in the nature of the US political-military-intelligence complex, created a constant forward movement of military and intelligence activities We have now more US military personnel in the area near Raqqa than ever before, we have more special forces there, we have more helicopters, we have more CIA people. In other words they ve created an entirely new dynamic here that is going to be very difficult to break. It s going to be very difficult to reverse it. Within the past few days it has also been reported that significant numbers of US military armored vehicles are arriving in areas to the north of Raqqa, not for use by Kurdish SDF fighters in the region but   according to a US spokesperson    for use by the Coalition .There is also the question of other countries funneling weapons and/or terrorists into Syria. In particular, American allies Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia have all played important roles in building up and perpetuating the conflict in Syria so far, and there is no reason to believe that they will cease doing so.For instance, Syrian news agency SANA frequently reports on seizures of Israeli-made weapons within Syrian borders. Another example can be found in a previous story broken by Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, in which she discovered ships were being used for transporting weapons into Syria via Saudi Arabian ports.So it is possible that whatever support is being withdrawn from terrorist factions in Syria could be redirected through cooperating countries or other conduits and still reach the same destination.Truth vs NarrativeIt is often said that truth is the first casualty of war. As regular readers of 21WIRE will already be aware, the levels of propaganda and deception in mainstream media narratives have reached new heights in coverage of the conflict in Syria. Even terms such as  moderate rebel  and  Assad regime  in common usage used by The Post and its ilk are tools of propaganda explicitily designed to legitimize the construction of a foreign-funded mercenary force to overthrow the government of Syria.The truth, however, is rising.For instance, the recent article, How America Armed Terrorists in Syria, spelled out just that: By helping its Sunni allies provide weapons to al Nusra Front and its allies and by funneling into the war zone sophisticated weapons that were bound to fall into al Nusra hands or strengthen their overall military position, U.S. policy has been largely responsible for having extended al Qaeda s power across a significant part of Syrian territory. The CIA and the Pentagon appear to be ready to tolerate such a betrayal of America s stated counter-terrorism mission. Unless either Congress or the White House confronts that betrayal explicitly, as Tulsi Gabbard s legislation would force them to do, U.S. policy will continue to be complicit in the consolidation of power by al Qaeda in Syria, even if the Islamic State is defeated there. So not only are the  rebels  not moderate, in many cases they are actually al Qaeda, the raison d etre for the War on Terror.Public awareness of this fact has been increasing, and in January Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act into the House of Representatives, while Senator Rand Paul, who has opposed the arming of Syrian opposition groups for years, introduced the bill in the Senate. On introducing the bill Rep. Gabbard s remarks included the statement: If you or I gave money, weapons or support to Al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Yet the US government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of Al-Qaeda, ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al Sham and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support, in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government. Then, within the past two weeks, 21WIRE covered the latest stunning chapter in a story broken by independent journalist Gaytandzhieva, which documents in full detail how hundreds of tons of heavy weapons were trafficked via protected diplomatic flights from various NATO member states and allies (including the US) to conflict zones around the the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Some of these arms ended up in the hands of al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda franchise in Syria.Stories like those on covert weapons shipments; statements like the one above from Tulsi Gabbard; the introduction of the Stop Arming Terrorists Act; stories such as How America Armed Terrorists in Syria; and the rising influence of independent media outlets like 21WIRE among others, are all contributing to the rising awareness that the US government has been funding, training and arming terrorists in Syria.It is likely that Trump s decision to end the CIA program supporting the anti-Assad terrorists in Syria  however meaningful it was or was not  was in part a response to this growing awareness. Although on the surface the decision by Trump seems to be a positive step towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria, by no means does it mean an end to the conflict or even a withdrawal of US or other foreign interference with Syrian affairs. It is more likely that this announcement is yet another distraction  a further exercise in perception management  and that the objective to remove Assad remains in place under other guises using other means.More on this from The Washington Post  A unit of the Southern Front, which received money and weapons from the US, et al.

" With Just One Phone Call, Trump SHATTERS Our Relationship With China Trump s brazen phone calls to various world leaders are upsetting diplomats, and with good reason. He s voicing admiration for some of the worst dictators in the world, such as the leader of Kazakhstan, and he wants to visit Pakistan. He also ruffled feathers in some circles when he issued a casual, offhand invitation to Britain s prime minister, Theresa May, following phone calls to nine other world leaders.His most recent phone call was to Taiwan, a country with which the U.S. has had no contact for nearly 40 years. In doing so, he may have upset the delicate balance that currently exists between us and China, because China thinks of Taiwan as a  renegade province. Okay, so China isn t a country that we re totally in love with right now. The problem with Trump doing this, though, is that China is still a trading partner, and if he wishes to be able to negotiate a better trade deal with them, he d do well to respect them and the delicate nature of our relationship with them right now.But all Trump has proven thus far is that he s an idiotic, ill-prepared, complete dolt when it comes to handling the presidency, and especially foreign relations. There things he doesn t even know to think about before calling absolutely everyone on the planet. White House press secretary Josh Earnest actually begged Trump to go through proper channels, meaning the Department of State, when contacting world leaders.Otherwise, his willy-nilly phone calls like this can shake up, or even destroy, relationships that are already on shaky ground.Like our relationship with China.He certainly didn t try to make a friend out of China during his campaign, blasting them repeatedly for stealing our jobs and essentially saying he was going to strongarm them into a trade agreement that was more favorable to us. And now Beijing would actually be right if they were pissed at him for this.Trump needs finesse. He needs discretion. He needs a shit-ton of help here. He s going to destroy all of our alliances before he even takes office this way.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",0
"Have the US, Trump Really Abandoned ‘Regime Change’ in Syria?  Member of the US-backed Free Syrian Army, Aleppo, Syria. (Photo: Mada Media. Source: Wikicommons)Miles Elliott 21st Century Wire For the past few days, news outlets have been reporting on the Trump Administration and CIA s announcement to end the controversial covert program to arm and train  moderate rebels  fighting to overthrow the Syrian government of Bashar al Assad. While many who want peace in Syria see this move as a step in the right direction, others still doubt that the underlying goal of ousting Assad has been abandoned completely. The decision may serve a number of purposes, but the long-term goals of the US and its close coalition allies do not change easily, and removing President Assad from power has been a centerpiece of their regional restructuring plan for a very long time.Does the announcement really mean that Trump is going to leave Assad alone? Is the US turning a corner in Syria and finally learning from the mistakes it made in Iraq and Libya? Is it really a concession to Russia? Is Trump finally actualizing his campaign rhetoric that seemed to reject America s foreign wars?Not likely.Of course, it s possible that Trump is at odds with other factions in the US government s military and foreign policy establishment, possibly because he recognizes the danger of arming terrorists and the political damage this might do to his own reputation as a leader who is  tough on terror.  Such a belief however, might be extremely generous to Trump, especially considering how under his authority the US military has dangerously escalated several wars, not just in Syria, but also in Yemen, and probably soon in Afghanistan.A more likely explanation is that the Trump administration and a complicit mainstream media are trying to manage public perceptions regarding six years of troublesome US involvement in Syria. In a bait-and-switch type PR deception, Washington might be attempting to generate the perception of de-escalation   even as the US increases its presence in Syria.Consider the SourceWithin hours of this story breaking, it had been covered by major outlets from across the mainstream media, and since that time there have been a variety of reactions from different commentators and media platforms.Some, such as former US diplomat Jim Jatras, are hailing the decision as a  game-changer .Others, like New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof (one of the first in the mainstream media to promote the White Helmets) called it a  major gift to Russia .Middle East  expert  Charles Lister claims it will strengthen terrorists in Syria, while numerous others are saying it will weaken the terrorists.Many of these reactions, however, as well as all of the reporting on this decision, all seem to stem from a single story in The Washington Post. That said, there are a few things that should be pointed out about this original story Washington Post and the CIAIt is well known that Amazon chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. It is also public knowledge that the CIA has a contract with Amazon to use its cloud computing services. In fact, beginning in 2014 Amazon began providing its services to the CIA under a $600 million contract that is good for up to ten years, making the CIA a long-term customer of Amazon. Seeing as the owner of The Washington Post has a long-term commercial relationship with the CIA, any reporting from that newspaper covering CIA activities could be viewed as a potential conflict of interest. This would be a very unpopular position for any mainstream media outlets to take. Normally, these outlets will unquestioningly repeat this or any story by The Post concerning the CIA, and that s the end of that.NOTE: After this article was published at 21WIRE, Trump came out swinging at Bezos and the  Amazon-Washington Post :The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017Of course this is not to say that the decision to end CIA support to terrorists in Syria has not been taken. Much of that activity will remain classified and certainly redacted if ever released. However, the fact that information was  leaked exclusively  to the Washington Post by unnamed US officials may indicate a desire to have the story spun in a particular way for particular reasons. Syrian  rebels  fire missiles toward the towns of Kafarya and Foua (Photo: Qasioun News Agency. Source: Wikicommons)Focus on RussiaA major element of the spin on the The Washington Post story can be found in the headline:  Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow  (emphasis added). From the outset, the Post is portraying the decision to stop arming groups trying to overthrow the Syrian government as a concession to Russia.This is clearly one of the themes of the article, as it also appears in quotes from an unnamed official who said,  Putin won in Syria , and from Charles Lister, who stated:  We are falling into a Russian trap.  In total, Russia, Moscow, Putin or the Kremlin are mentioned no less than 20 times in the article, a clear sign of The Post s attempt to place Trump s decision in the context of Russian interests in Syria.There are several obvious problems with this narrative, however.Firstly, it is implied that if Russia  wins  in Syria, that America somehow  loses   but is that really the case? One of the points Trump campaigned on is that US and Russian interests in Syria are actually aligned in the wider fight to defeat ISIS and radical Islamist terror.Secondly, there is zero evidence to indicate that the decision to end CIA support for terrorist groups in Syria was driven by Russia   but that hasn t stopped many in the mainstream media, like New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof, and Washington establishment figures like John McCain, for inferring a Russian conspiracy is at play. It is true that The Post s article was published within two weeks of the recent ceasefire in southwestern Syria agreed by the US, Russia and Jordan. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the decision to halt the  train and equip  program in Syria was made a month ago, after a White House meeting between Trump, national security advisor H R McMaster, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.At most, leaking the story to the press may have been an empty gesture toward Russia, but facts on the ground still indicate that the conflict in Syria is being escalated in other ways, as we shall see. Independent journalist Gareth Porter offers this analysis: By 2016, when the Syrian government, with the support of the Russians and Iranians and others, were able to push the al-Qaeda-led rebels out of Aleppo, really the major part of the conflict between the rebels and the Assad government was completed. And from then on I think the fate of this program was really sealed The decision to announce this clearly followed the agreement that was reached very recently with the Russians on a ceasefire in southern Syria  And so to announce it was a gesture in part towards the Russians, but the idea that has been reported in some news media that somehow this is a concession to the Russians is totally false. That really doesn t follow logically, in terms of the nature of the decision and the timing of it. Furthermore, to believe the decision is a  gift  to Russia is to completely discount the fact that arming terrorists is simply wrong, or at the very least dangerous. As former US diplomat Jim Jatras stated: It doesn t occur to some people that not supporting terrorists is the right thing for America, having nothing to do with Russia. Thirdly, in light of the year-long string of unsubstantiated and unproven accusations perpetuated by US mainstream media that somehow the Trump team  colluded  with Russia to affect the outcome of the US presidential election, pushing the Russian angle to this story in Syria appears to be an attempt to add fuel to that fire. However, if one unpacks the rationale underlying this suggestion, it becomes clear how illogical it really is.As it turns out, even US commanders do not subscribe to the Russian conspiracy theory angle regarding the CIA stopping arms to  rebels  in Syria. This was confirmed by U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of Special Operations Command, who told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado the following this past week: At least from what I know about that program and the decision to end it, (it was) absolutely not a sop to the Russians.  If mainstream media institutions like The Post object to alleged Russian interference in US elections, they presumably do so on the grounds that foreign interference in a sovereign country s domestic affairs is  against the rules  of the international community. If that is the case, then surely they must also object to the funding and arming of terrorist or  rebel  groups by one country to overthrow the government of another. If The Post were being consistent, and not hypocritical in their editorial line, then any disapproval at the unsubstantiated allegation that Russia interfered  nonviolently   with America s democracy, should be matched by unbridled outrage at the US funding, training and arming terrorists in Syria to violently overthrow its government.

" Here’s Why A Homeless Man Refused To Come Down From A Giant Tree (VIDEO) On March 22, Cody Lee Miller, a homeless man who calls the streets of Seattle, Washington his residence, climbed to the top of an eighty-foot tree.Over the next 25 hours, the city of Seattle watched anxiously as Miller refused all attempts by authorities to coax him down from his perch at the top of the giant conifer.People snapped pictures and took cell phone video, posting to Twitter under the hashtag #manintree.The Seattle Times, Washington Post, Detroit News, USA Today and other media outlets around the country covered the story as it unfolded.Image credit: @VixenRogue via TwitterAt various times Miller threw pine cones and tree branches at rescue workers, as they attempted to coax him down.Watch the video from USA Today on YouTube below.At other times, his behavior seemed even more reckless.Image credit: RT America via Twitter.Toward the end of the day, he built a makeshift bed among the branches where he apparently fell asleep for the night. Image credit: Seattle Times via TwitterMore than a day later, a crowd of onlookers cheered as he finally made his way back to the ground below.Here s video of Miller finally coming down from the tree, courtesy of USA Today on youtube.Once he was safe on the ground, Miller was taken to Harborview Medical Center where he underwent a psychiatric examination. He was then taken to jail, where he was booked on charges of criminal mischief.What prompted Miller to climb the tree in the first place?Aside from obvious mental health issues, KOMO reports that three days before Miller was taken into police custody for the crime of  sitting on the sidewalk  near a Starbucks on East Pike Street.His criminal record suggests it was not the first time he d been arrested for the crime of having nowhere to go. He was arrested more than once in Oregon. The charges included things like criminal mischief, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness.If you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk, if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space, where can you go?Maybe you d try to climb a tree, hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist.Of course that s not how it played out in Miller s case. Climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention.Some, including the police, turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes.Not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation, though.Many Twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues, as well as for those who are homeless.As KOMO reports, at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation.Janice Wilson, who was in town from Crescent City, California, to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles, said she was once homeless herself, 30 years ago.She repeatedly shouted up to the man:  We love you! Come down safely! I heard people out here laughing,  she said.  If somebody s in crisis to the point of putting himself at risk of suicide, what s to laugh about? As of November 2015, there were more than 565,000 homeless people in the United States.The city of Seattle is just one of many American cities that declared a state of emergency in 2015, due to the number of homeless people who reside there.While the number of homeless people in Seattle is on the decline, thanks to an increase in wages in the city, for people with physical and mental disabilities, getting a job and  pulling yourself up by your bootstraps  isn t always the answer.With proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal, productive lives once the condition is treated. But a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment.According to New York Daily News, Miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today.Instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs, it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated, along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the United States.Featured image via video screen capture KOMO  ",0

"YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHO DEFEATED A BILL IN JUNE TO ARM OUR SOLDIERS AT RECRUITING CENTERS AND BASES Even though he s a RINO THIS is a shocker! In June, Nevada s Republican Sen. Dean Heller tried to get the Pentagon to change its practice of banning arms from our soldiers on bases and in recruiting centers here in America. Unfortunately for our soldiers, John McCain was the principle foe of the move and helped to defeat the arming of our soldiers, a decision that recently had deadly consequences in Tennessee. Last week Nebraska Senator Dean Heller appeared spoke to radio host Kevin Wall on KKFT AM in Carson City, NV, to talk about his amendment and noted that John McCain himself defeated the move to arm our soldiers.Here is a transcript of what Heller to the radio station: Dean Heller:  So I submitted an amendment in the Department of Defense Authorization bill to allow this to happen. Now this was of course six weeks ago before Chattanooga. And the chairman of the committee wouldn t support it by the way, chairman was John McCain did not want the amendment as part of the bill and wouldn t accept it. Here is what Heller said on his website about the bill: Today, U.S. Senator Dean Heller sent a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, requesting that National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conferees include his amendment to give military base commanders the authority to allow service members to carry personal firearms on base for their personal protection and force protection. In June, Senator Heller offered this amendment during the Senate s consideration of the Fiscal Year 2016 NDAA. In addition, Senator Heller introduced stand-alone legislation to address this issue critical to the safety of our nation s service members. John McCain made sure that the Marines who died in Chattanooga and all their brethren would not be able to fire back and save lives when a terrorist attacked. How s THAT from a  war hero ? Granted, even if the amendment had been included in the Pentagon budget bill and passed, it isn t too likely that the change would have been made quickly enough to have allowed the Marines in Tennessee to protect themselves against an ISIS terrorist s rampage. But that isn t the point, here. The point is McCain saw no reason to even allow them to be able to defend themselves. In the terror attacks on the two Chattanooga recruiting facilities we now see just how wrong McCain is.Via: publiusforum",1
" Unhinged Sean Spicer Lashes Out At ‘Silly’ Reporters During INSANE Press Briefing (VIDEO) White House press secretary Sean Spicer held a press briefing today and inadvertently just handed Saturday Night Live new material. Spicer repeatedly interrupted and talked over reporters while trying to defend alleged president Donald Trump. He also had to address top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway s blunder this morning on Fox & Friends in which she literally hawked Ivanka s clothing line.A reporter asked about Trump s attacks on a federal judge this week. Part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind   he s not going to hold back when he feels passionate,  Spicer said.Other reporters asked about that, too, then the exchange became more tense. Thank you, you ve now asked the question about eight times,  Spicer said. Something she said to CNN earlier this week is that the President doesn t comment on everything,  a reporter said.  I want to contrast the President s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on Quebec s mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President, when he chooses to I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences,  Spicer interrupted.  I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say I was here!  the reporter said. I know, so why are you asking why he didn t do it when I literally stood here and did it?  Spicer asked. I m talking about the President s statement  the reporter said. I don t understand what you re asking,  Spicer replied. Kellyanne s comments were about how the President doesn t have time to tweet about everything,  the reporter said.  He s tweeting about this. He s not tweeting about something else. I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President  Spicer said. We re talking about the President s time,  the reporter said. What are you you re equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don t, I mean that s the silliest thing I ve ever heard. OK. This is silly,  Spicer said while speaking over the reporter.  Next. OK. Thank you. You ve asked your question. Thank you. Conway s bigly mistake this morning was brought up. Questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump,  a reporter said.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line here? Kellyanne has been counseled and that s all we re going to go with,  Spicer replied.  She s been counseled on that subject, and that s it. Not so fast, Spanky. She violated Federal Code  2635.702.Watch: Melissa McCarthy is sitting somewhere with a big smile on her face.Read more:Image via screen capture",0
" Sarah Palin Faced Sexual Harassment At Fox News, But She Would Rather Protect The Network Than Say Something When high-profile women like Sarah Palin stay silent, it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted.As Fox News continues to reel in the aftermath of Bill O Reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with Roger Ailes  own sexual harassment scandal, former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there.But not Sarah Palin. Palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate.During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave Fox News was more about looking for different opportunities.TAPPER:  It sounds like you experienced something. PALIN:  I just   you know, it was just time to part ways and, and, you know, get   get out there in, I guess, a more diverse arena to express views. In fact, Palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at Fox News than she did for the perpetrators. If a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through. Sarah Palin collected a paycheck for five years (2010-2015) from Fox News as a contributor and analyst.The sexual harassment was there from the start.In 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if Palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview. Seriously.In 2011, Roger Ailes openly admitted that he only hired Palin  because she was hot and got ratings. Tucker Carlson, who has been with Fox News since 2009 and was just recently promoted to take Bill O Reilly s place, posted an incredibly sexist tweet about Palin in 2011 that he was forced to delete. Palin s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander in Milfistan,  Carlson wrote.In other words, things haven t changed much at all at Fox News. The network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one.If Palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network. And she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it. She is protecting Fox News by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk.Palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite. As a strong woman, I say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change. But Palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at Fox News, and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle.This is why Sarah Palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
"BREAKING: YOU’RE FIRED! FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY OUT! Wow! This is clearly something the White House prepared for because they had a packet of information available for the press to look over.Deputy AG Rosentein sent out an email with information regarding Comey s gaffes. Then this The White House released a statement confirming the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey:All we can say about this is   It s about time!Comey had 7 years left in his 10 year tenure at the FBI.AG jeff Sessions recommended this firing The White House announced Tuesday afternoon that FBI Director James Comey was fired. Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.  President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The FBI is one of our nation s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,  Trump said in the statement.VIA: BUSINESS INSIDER",1
" Trump Just ADMITTED He Mindlessly Parrots Russian Propaganda And Twitter Kicked His Teeth In (TWEETS) Donald Trump once said that he loves  the poorly educated,  and he skips his intelligence briefings regularly, so it is reasonable to assume that he is not a fan of  intelligence  in any form. But on Thursday, the Donald took to Twitter to assure everyone that this isn t true   and to backtrack on his agreements with Julian Assange so fast that one is forced to wonder what information he learned about Russia s hack of the election in the past 24 hours. The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange   wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people,  Trump tweeted, apparently forgetting that his vapid, meth-addled Nazi followers prefer him to use the word L genpresse,  to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against  Intelligence  when in fact I am a big fan!The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange   wrong.

The media lies to make it look like I am against ""Intelligence"" when in fact I am a big fan!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017The hacked emails were not just distributed by Assange, who is currently hiding out from rape charges in an embassy, but by  Guccifer 2.0  and  DC Leaks  as well   two web sites run by actual, bona fide, Russian agents. Nevertheless, though he admits he doesn t look into who gives him information, Assange claims that he didn t receive the emails  from Russia.  On Wednesday, Trump mindlessly parroted the claim because it supports his nonsensical decision to spend every waking moment doing the Twitter equivalent of dropping to his knees in front of Putin and, well, you get the idea.In his nonsensical morning tweet, Wednesday Edition, Trump informed the world that his  intelligence  (yes, he put the word in quotes again) had been delayed by a few days and attacked  intelligence agencies  (he could have meant any of the more than a bakers  dozen who say that Russia absolutely hacked us, and Putin led the operation, but he seems to mean the CIA). This was a lie.He followed that up by spreading Assange s nonsensical claim that their friend Vladdy Poot didn t give him the information and by attacking the DNC for getting hacked.But even though The Donald regularly tweets out agreements with Assange   including the false claim that Russia had nothing to do with the hack (something he would know if he actually attended intelligence briefings)   he says his tweets should not be construed as agreement with the sexual predator behind the release of some of the hacked documents Russian hackers stole.

I don't think you know what you want to say. for the people  Billy Spillwater (@BillySpillwater) January 5, 2017Interestingly, in 2010, Trump didn t agree with Assange so much as he wanted to have him murdered. You see, before Russia and Wikileaks teamed up to hack and release information about his opponent in what the intelligence community agrees was an effort to install him in office, The Donald said that Assange is  disgraceful  and that  there should be like death penalty or something  for his new rapist friend.Putin, on the other hand, Trump has just always loved. A few years back, The Donald tweeted that he hopes the brutal Russian dictator becomes his  new best friend. It s nice that we re all friends now, and that Assange and Trump are bonding over the  dishonest press,  but if Trump is getting his  intelligence  from Russia and some rapist, it s time we talk about peacefully removing him from the White House and   what was that thing he wanted to do to his opponent, who had legitimately not committed a crime? Oh, yes,  locking him up. Featured image via Getty Images (Christopher Furlong)/screengrab",0
" Billionaire Mark Cuban Endorses Hillary, Burns Trump: He’s Gone ‘Batsh*t Crazy’ (VIDEO) Mark Cuban is much richer than Donald Trump. He is also sane enough to see that Donald Trump is a lunatic who would destroy the country. That is why Cuban has endorsed Hillary Clinton. He also devoted his Saturday afternoon campaigning for her in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.While taking the stage in front of more than 5,000 people, Cuban immediately lit into Trump, even going so far as to call the real estate tycoon turned wannabe politician a  jagoff,  which is apparently a local term to describe an incompetent jackass like Trump. Cuban said: You know what we call a person like that, you know, the screamers, the yellers, the people who try to intimidate you? You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jag-off. Is there any bigger jag-off in the world than Donald Trump? This, of course was greeted with cheers from Cuban s hometown crowd. In an interview with CNN, Cuban said that he was doing all he can to get Clinton elected because he is afraid of Donald Trump. Cuban said: Initially, I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there. But then he went off the reservation and went bats  crazy. Cuban isn t the only prominent American who thinks Trump is nuts. The Democratic National Convention stage was littered with Republicans and Independents who want Hillary elected in order to save the world from Trump. This list includes former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, and former Reagan White House Official Doug Elmets.Other Republicans really need to listen to Cuban, Bloomberg, Elmets, and other people who are trying to save this great nation from this dangerously unqualified demagogue. Swallow your pride, forget about politics, and think of the bigger picture, folks. The future of the country and the world depend on electing Hillary Clinton and defeating Donald Trump.Watch the video of Cuban s stump speech below:Featured image via video screen capture ",0
"THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: How Strong Arm Tactics By ANTI-CAPITALIST LEFT Could Destroy Millions Of American Jobs The fast food industry has been warning those demanding a $15/hr. wage that they could be easily replaced.In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton. It s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,  former McDonald s USA CEO Ed Rensi said in an interview on Tuesday on the Fox Business Network s  Mornings with Maria.   It s nonsense and it s very destructive and it s inflationary and it s going to cause a job loss across this country like you re not going to believe. According to Rensi, rising labor costs are forcing chains to cut entry-level jobs and replace workers with machines. Currently, Wendy s, McDonald s, and Panera are rolling out kiosks across the US, in part because of the rising cost of labor.  Business InsiderAccording to statista.com, in 2016, there were over 3.7 million people in the US who were employed in the fast food industry. When those jobs go away, where will these workers go for employment? Will they be forced to do the jobs that  only the illegal aliens will do? Wendy s just announced their plans to install self-ordering kiosks at about 1,000 locations by the end of the year.A typical location would have three kiosks, The Columbus Dispatch reported. Higher-volume restaurants will be given priority for the kiosks.Wendy s chief information officer, David Trimm, said the kiosks are intended to appeal to younger customers and reduce labor costs. Kiosks also allow customers of the fast food giant to circumvent long lines during peak dining hours while increasing kitchen production.Trim estimates the company will see a return on its investment in less than two years. They are looking to improve their automation and their labor costs, and this is a good way to do it,  said Darren Tristano, vice president with Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm.  They are also trying to enhance the customer experience. Younger customers prefer to use a kiosk. Customers will still be able to order at the counter for now, although Tristan predicts that mobile ordering and payment via smartphones will one day overtake self-ordering kiosks and cash registers.

"SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Goes All Creepy Predicting The 2016 Election: “Everything is up for grabs” What the heck is wrong with these loony liberal political hack Supreme Court justices? We had a proclamation from Latina Sotomayor that white men couldn t possibly know what it s like to be a minority huh?  Now we have Ruth  Buzzy  Ginsburg saying that if Hillary doesn t win then  everything is up for grabs . She also put in a plug for a pro-Hillary presidency saying she doesn t want to think about a Trump presidency. What the heck is up with these supposedly unbiased people who should not be speaking out politically. All the more reason to vote for Trump to make the court more conservative just to piss off the political hags hacks on the court WASHINGTON   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she doesn t want to think about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the White House, and she predicts the next president    whoever she will be    will have a few appointments to make to the Supreme Court.In an interview Thursday in her court office, the 83-year-old justice and leader of the court s liberal wing said she presumes Democrat Hillary Clinton will be the next president. Asked what if Republican Donald Trump won instead, she said,  I don t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs. That includes the future of the high court itself, on which she is the oldest justice. Two justices, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, are in their late 70s. It s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,  Ginsburg said, smiling.She didn t sound as though she is preparing to step down soon and shows no signs of slowing down. Ginsburg said she has been catching up on sleep since the court finished its work last week before a busy summer of travel that will take her to Europe and, as is her custom, to see as much opera as she can fit in.In the wide-ranging interview, Ginsburg reviewed the just-ended term during which she lost her best friend on the court and, partly as a result, was on the winning side of most of the high-profile cases. Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, depriving his conservative allies of a reliable vote and leaving eight justices to decide nearly five dozen cases.President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the ninth seat, but Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing or vote on Garland s nomination, arguing the next president should have the right to name Scalia s replacement. Even if the Senate were to confirm Garland after the election, the court probably would hear three months of cases without him, Ginsburg said.And if there s no action in a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress, the vacancy could last the entire term, she said.She said court majorities this term moved to shut down tactics used by opponents of abortion and of affirmative action in higher education in two major cases.Ginsburg said she doesn t expect to see any more such cases after the court upheld the use of race in college admissions in Texas and struck down Texas abortion-clinic regulations that the state said were needed to protect patients. It seemed to me it was a sham to pretend this was about a woman s health,  rather than about making it harder to get an abortion, Ginsburg said.She disputed reports that the court is taking on only relatively unimportant cases while waiting for a ninth justice. It isn t so. We haven t selected them with a view to dodging challenging cases. We take them as they come to us,  she said.Via: CBS",1
"WOW! RUSSIAN LAWYER Who Met With Donald Trump Jr. Seen In Photo With Person Tied To Obama Only 8 Days After Meeting Much to the dismay of mainstream media journalists, Donald Trump Jr. released all email communication regarding his meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya today on Twitter. Meanwhile, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has told NBC News that she met with Donald Trump Jr. to discuss sanctions, that she did not have any Kremlin connections, and that she did not hand over information about Hillary s campaign.She confirmed her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. was about Russian adoptions in the US.But is there more to Natalia Veselnitskaya than meets the eye? Who is she? Does she have ties to Obama and the Democratic Party? Was the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. a set up?According to The Gateway Pundit: The law firm where Veselnitskaya is listed as managing partner, Kamerton Consulting, is based in a Moscow suburb and does not even have a website.A staff member at Kamerton told The Associated Press Veselnitskaya was unavailable for comment on Monday.Her office in Moscow may be a shell. There is no working phone, email or website.Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump s senior staff and Veselnitskaya and  does not know who that is. Peskov said, No, we don t know who that is and obviously we can t monitor all meetings Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad. Now this Natalia Veselnitskaya was sitting with Obama s Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, 8 days after cold-contacting Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.Here s a shot showing who appears to be Natalia Veselnitskaya, sitting behind  from the June 14, 2016 Congressional hearing on Russia and the Ukraine.Natalia Veselnitskaya photo:MORE  That looks like Emin Agalarov sitting next to Natalia Veselnitskaya. He was mentioned in Donald Trump Jr s statement this morning. Emin helped set up the meeting with Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya was also connected to Fusion GPS, the DNC opposition research firm that produced the fraudulent and discredited Trump Dossier.So why was Veselnitskaya hanging out with Obama officials just days after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?And why was Veselnitskaya given a privileged seat up front during the Congressional hearing?
